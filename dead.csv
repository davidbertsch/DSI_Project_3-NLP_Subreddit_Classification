Most underrated show?,"I'm a massive deadhead, have listened to an insane number of shows and just got my face burglarized for the first time in a while just now listening to 9/18/74. I'd listened to a few tracks from the show before, it's been in my favorites on my archive app for a minute, but I randomly decided to give a closer listen and holy crap.


 The Caution jam is some of the *very* best improv of the whole year, which is saying a fucking lot, and transitions into a beautiful Ship of Fools. So got splattered a bit by Caution, decided to take it from the top. So. insanely. good. Opens with an inspired UJB, then a smoking Jack Straw and then the first FOD since '72 and that's where I'm at now and I am fucking *absorbed*. I listen to a stupid amount of dead, '74 especially, so this is not very common for me to get sucked in like this.

Mother American Night,"I finished up this book recently and thought it was great.  It's not a literary work of art, but John is a good storyteller.  I particularly enjoyed the LSD stories, working with Dick Cheney, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and electronic freedom press.  For us, his greatest accomplishments were the songs he wrote with Bob Weir, I think for him, the songs ended up being an awesome $6000 a month guaranteed that freed him up to live as he saw fit. 

I loved the stories about him and Bob as kids in Colorado.  And how working with a couple other songwriters outside of Bob just proved his point that Bob was hard to deal with and never quite did what John had in mind with any of the lyrics.  Yet they remained best friends and writing partners for most of their lives.   

John's life makes me jealous. As I sit at an office desk just watching the clock, I want more adventure and meaning.  In my late teens and 20's I fought so hard against anything that would lead me to sitting in a desk. I failed out of college, went to work as a bartender in Denver, and spent all my free time writing songs, playing gigs and recording. Late nights every night, hanging out with whoever, whenever. Meeting interesting people from all over the world, and not taking care of my self too well.  At 30, I got tired.  And wanted a normal life. I have that now, and just miss the stories I had in my 20s. While I still have stories, they are nowhere near as exciting as Johns.  I'd never be willing to take as many risks.  But his life story is an inspiration to get out there and go after it all the way.

Opinion on which Dead and company show to see.,"Ok folks, planning on going to my first Dead and co show.   I live in Indianapolis and my default venue is always deer creek ( Noblesville, Indiana rouff home mortgage center )

Maybe it’s better to just travel to Cali or Washington.... so I was wanting some opinions on which show you think would be the best To see.

Licensing for GD Art.,"Hey all. Ive recently got into oil painting, and wish to start painting and selling GD themed art on my store on Etsy and locally. My question is, what is the process of “legally” doing so, and staying true to the band and not pirating merchandise I guess. 

Also what would require licensing. Some I have asked say that a portrait of Jerry I could get away without permission, but a painting of the album cover would. Do the stealies and the dancing bears need permission? 

Any info I can get would be of great help. And once I know what direction I should go from here I can begin painting, and will be sure to share with you all!!

I started with the early studio records, and when I got to Aoxomoxoa (specifically St. Stephen) I thought to myself “Oh, I’m in.” That was when I was 18, I’m 21 now and the Dead is what I listen to most of the time. Anytime I hear St. Stephen, live recording or studio, I always reference it in my head as the song that turned me into a Deadhead.

Dead To Me NEW EPISODE! Episode 9: Battle of the Beards!,"New episode! Hope you dig it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the goofiest idea for an episode ever. But the vibrations are real good. Casey had this crazy thought to compare the Grateful Dead and the Beach Boys—two acts that can legitimately claim the title “America’s Band.” On the surface, that doesn’t make a lot of sense, but think about it: besides having amazing beards, both bands represent aspects of mythological California. They also were innovators and experimenters with obsessive fans and no small amount of exuberance and pathos. Special guest Arthur Adams—a Bay area producer and director at [The Clock Factory](https://theclock.us/) who also performs as the robot in the sci-fi / punk / new wave band [The Phenomenauts](http://www.silversprocket.net/progress/)—talks about how he got your host hooked on the Beach Boys, that one time the Boys jammed with the Boys, and more. Eduardo and Casey kick around the concept of America’s Band, and whether we need or even deserve one. Feed Your Head profiles erstwhile beardo and Deadhead Elvis Costello. Surf’s up!

Grateful Dead saved my life,"I spent two separate stays at inpatient mental health facilities at the end of last year. The first facility - which I hated - had the redeeming quality of a room closed off with Sirius radio. I would lay on the cold tile floor in my misfit scrubs as The Grateful Dead Channel soothed me. I got through that stay, tried to get back to life, but things slowly unraveled and a thwarted suicide attempt resulted in a trip to the ER and a stay on the top floor of an old Gothic style hospital hundreds of miles from home - the loony bin. First therapy session is music therapy, out of a wing of between 20-30 only I and two other patients show up: a young, handsome, well-spoken college sophomore and a middle aged woman suffering terribly from schizophrenia (she would talk to the person in her head, but not to anyone else). The counselor running the program gives us a list of almost 200 songs he has the sheet music for, about fifteen Dead songs. He hands out drums, he has an acoustic guitar. We start off with Uncle John's Band, the counselor turned out to be an extremely skilled musician. The college kid and I awkwardly banged on our drums, more-or-less just enjoying the talent of the counselor. A couple minutes in, the woman starts beating her drum as fast as possible. Head down, a hurricane of her hair flying and hands striking the drum. I see her look up. She's wearing a smile. 

Right now I lay in bed listening to Franklin's Tower (JRAD Brooklyn Bowl 10-13-17), with my best friend (3 month old pup named Jerry) and a calendar full of concerts I'm looking forward to this Spring and Summer. I still take things a day at a time and life is hard, but I plan to ""just keep truckin' on."" ",gratefuldead,1552194984,ajump08,27,190,True,2019-03-10

Officially on the Dark Star train. Don't really know what happened.,"I distinctly remember a few years back being told to listen to Veneta because of it's Dark Star and even then I wasn't impressed. I was never a fan of Dark Star (Or Drums&gt;space for that matter) but the other day I was working on my guitar build and just put the Veneta Dark Star on because I needed a 30 minute timer and holy shit. Phil stole the show by the way. Not even a question, that song was his. 

I didn't even realize the 30 minutes had gone by. And I've tried to listen to it under the influence and it was even worse to me. But something happened and I've been on a binge ever since. I'm going to 4 D and C shows this summer and I'm really hoping to catch one of their versions of it. ",gratefuldead,1552225942,Durkbeef,19,14,True,2019-03-10

Jun Po Denis Kelly &amp; The Grateful Dead ( Some insight into the L Families ),"“I became the head of a “family”—an extended community in the psychedelic world—that produced a product called Clear Light, and then later Windowpane. There were twenty-eight people spread out around the world, mostly in the United States, and we made around thirty million doses over ten years. We gave away large, large quantities at concerts. This was very common during that time, with the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin and the Airplane. We’d go to the parties, the big concerts, which were the gatherings of the tribes, you know, the psychedelic music fairs, and the different families would come and give their LSD away.

I was the one who built up our distribution network. I hung out with the Grateful Dead. Took a few drum lessons with Bill Kreutzmann, as a matter of fact. I had a backstage pass, meaning I’d just walk in and out of the place. We called ourselves the Order of the Golden Toad. I melted down a seventeenth-century French Roman Catholic chalice and had it cast into golden frogs. We’d have a ritual initiation after you were with the family for a while, and everyone got a golden frog. So we all wore these frogs on chains. That was our symbol. I still have it on a necklace that I wear occasionally.

........

By 1970, my face had become known, and I had to go underground. For the next ten years, I was actively being sought by the Drug Enforcement Administration, with a fifty thousand dollar cash reward for information leading to my arrest. So I disappeared into the forests of Oregon. My partner took over the distribution network, and I joined my other partner in the lab in actually synthesizing LSD.

I remember having several arguments around the issue of purity with Owsley Stanley—the Bear. We didn’t want anyone to adulterate our LSD; it had to be 250 micrograms of 100 percent “D-normal” so that you could have a nondual experience. It had to be perfectly dry and absolutely pure, and we were quite dedicated to that. To control the purity, we’d cast it in a thin layer of gelatin. Then we’d cut it into tiny one-tenth-of-an-inch squares that you could look right through, which is why it came to be known as Windowpane. So you could no longer adulterate the product. But now it would be subject to light, and LSD will equilibrate when light hits it. It flips from the D-normal to the “isomer,” and that makes LSD speedy. This was the argument I had with Owsley. He felt strongly about not subjecting it to light, and I was more interested in preventing people from polluting the product. Who leaves their LSD lying around in the sun anyway? “-Jun Po Denis Kelly",gratefuldead,1549017595,Brightwings73,23,1,True,2019-02-01

How to jam on Dark Star?,"Is it really just A Mixolydian, vamping on an A and a G? It sounds so free form and devoid of any structure, especially the version from Live/Dead 1969. Jerry's soloing has more of an eerie quality to it, as opposed to his ""typical"" happy-go-lucky sound, even though it's notated in many places online as a typical Dead two-chord vamp. 

The A-G part is clear during the intro, when lyrics are sung, and when returning to the lyric sections. However, when it really breaks into Jerry soloing, it sounds completely wild. As the intensity builds, the A-G structure becomes less and less apparent, and it sounds almost atonal. I can hear Bobby playing a consistent rhythm at times of two chords, though it doesn't sound like straight major triads, and he often abandons it for a more wild rhythm part. Phil is a bit all over the place, playing some very melodic bass. Just a very interesting jam that isn't as easy to analyze as something like Fire on the Mountain, even if the chord changes are supposedly similar. 

I'm just wondering how they go about playing this song when they stray from the normal structure of it, without sounding terrible. Is it just improvising chops? This seems like a step above normal improvisation, since even the harmony seems to be improvised on the spot at times. Or maybe they're just tricking me by constantly playing different inversions of A and G. Let me know, fellow Deadhead musicians. ",gratefuldead,1549079990,SteveAtHome,18,1,True,2019-02-01

They’re the same people who bitch about John Mayer even though he can play the fuck out of his guitar.

Paradigm shift; Summer Tour,"Can I still get on the bus? I’ve been catching a couple summer shows the past few years and it always leaves that looming feeling. I’m thinking about at the Shoreline (home-ish) shows, just not going back if I can help it. Is it feasible? Do people still just get out and go? I’m hella young and the world is getting to big not to see. 

Might not be the best place to ask; but I live in the mountains and there are few heads around to talk to. I know life of crazy and I know I’m supposed to live it. 

I guess I’m just looking for words of encouragement and advice. Thanks ",gratefuldead,1549567356,dddouten,12,1,True,2019-02-07

2019 box set predictions,"We get a box set every year. Last year was the 73/74 PNW set.

Now I do not believe all music editions count. Seeing how the 30 trips box set has come back I also believe this year we may get 1 or 2 more box sets from the past.

Now the biggest possibility I believe we will get is a throwback to the Fillmore West 1969 set. 

As an official one I believe Alpine 89 is the biggest possibility. I also hope it is seeing as how more good 89 shows should be circulated.

2022 May get us the Europe 72 one back.

I’d also like to see a spring 1990 and may 77 revival. As well as winter land 77/78.",gratefuldead,1549574706,Stratengar,21,1,True,2019-02-07

Give me a reason each year of the Dead is the best,"I love hearing people make a case for why each year of the Dead is their favorite. In fact, I think I might have seen people mention them all (except maybe not some of the 90's). So let's see why that is.

'68: Experimental music dripping with psychedelia

'72: crisp &amp; clean Dead sound

'74: jazzy Dead

Must Have Been the Roses and Robert Hunter's MUSIC,"Going through a Must Have been the Roses phase. While poking around the web, I found on [dead.net](https://dead.net) the tidbit that this was **one** of only **two** songs for which the dead utilized  both Robert Hunter's lyrics &amp; music. Making it a dead rendition/cover/interpretation of a Robert Hunter song, not a Garcia/Hunter collaboration. Even though it first appeared as a Garcia solo album track that was performed by the Dead! Nevertheless, everywhere I look the song is credited to only Hunter as the composer. SO...

1. What a beautiful and incredible song, I surely thought it was a JG melody, but it shows how those two were really on the same wavelength. 
2. WTF is the other song that the dead/JG used Hunter's music for? I can't figure it out.",gratefuldead,1549640324,dotmane,10,1,True,2019-02-08

Carlton Cuts Vol. 1 Release,"I've been working on this on and off the past week and thought I'd share.

The idea was to highlight less appreciated runs of shows.

Link to soundcloud album here: [https://soundcloud.com/gray-carlton/sets/september-1973](https://soundcloud.com/gray-carlton/sets/september-1973)

Will upload to youtube soon.

Its a selection of jams from their 1973 September tour featuring a horn section for a few of the songs. 

I wanted to make a project featuring deep cuts designed as a proselytizer for novices, and it is mostly comprised of upbeat and digestible jams.

I also made songs that jam into each other on one track instead of separate ones so that even on shuffle they can be listened to properly

No-one would consider this 10 stop 1973 September tour as some of the best stuff of '73, but there are some really cool moments for sure. A standout here is the Weather Report Suite&gt;Stella Blue.

Tape trading?,"Howdy y'all. 

I have recently dug out my dad's old tape deck, hooked it up to my stereo, and been buying up official Dead release cassettes like crazy on eBay. Now, I'm curious if there is still a tape trading community out there. I see folks selling their collection on eBay so I know people still have them! 

Obviously, I know that torch has passed on to digital trading, but, honestly, the music lends itself so much more to good ole analog. Now, I could always plug my audio interface and dub straight from [archive.org](https://archive.org) or etree but I have to say, the cassette community fascinates me!

Favorite Playin In The Band?,"I personally enjoy the version from 6/22/73 as well as 6/30/73, not to mention 7/1. I don't think there's anything quite like that sound ever again in any version even in later 73 or 74. It's this ridiculously weird few versions that are incredibly melodic and bass driven (6/22) and have no moment where any musical idea is left unused and they go into a huge kaleidoscope of colors and harmonically interesting whirlwind of pure virtuosity and it's absolutely insane. Or, from 6/30, that version is short and to the point but has a dark, undiscernable quality of pure chaos to it and one can almost envision the music coming out like tendrils from the pits of hell itself. The 20+ minute long version from 7/1 has almost Dark Star level qualities to it and brings the song to a whole new level they'd explore in 74. These few versions alone put Playin as one of my top songs in their catalog because it was truly a mind-boggling and face melting beast of a song.",gratefuldead,1549681973,PhlegmeseeJed,37,1,True,2019-02-08

Talking to someone who smoked crack 3 days in a row with Jerry.,"I work in premium car sales. Recently one of our top brokers came in and I had to help him drive over to a clients house. On the way to the car he started humming Fair the well. I asked him if he liked the dead. He laughed and said that he sells and deals with all their cars. He has been to 200+ shows and known them personally since 72 because his dad was in the music industry. This shocked me. I just saw the band Jerry's Middle Finger last week so it gave me insight to Jerry's playing. I had so many questions about him personally. I asked if he'd ever known Jerry. To which he replied he smoked crack for 3 days with him. How do you respond to that except with when, where, why, how? I asked how his relationship with him was, which can be a broad question. He replied that it wasnt a good relationship because it was built around drugs. He said Jerry was very humble and down to earth, but unfortunately a ""bonified drug addict"". I already kind of knew this. It was just the sad truth. But it was just so interesting to get first person resources. I asked about lsd and when they stopped using it in favor of other drugs. He said that early on it was all lsd but like Bill K. Said it best, cocaine consumed them. But he talked about how on there were Visine bottles of  Owsley LSD being passed around. And you would just tilt your head back and squirt a bunch of drops. It was super clean. All color. No sucked into your head or paranoia. He also talked about how you can see Jerry any night in a small club in san Francisco when the dead weren't playing. Another thing he mentioned was how bobby was very witty. He's extremely well read.

"Look out of any window, any morning, any evening, any day....","Hi all, 

On Tuesday morning my 57-year-old father had a heart attack and unfortunately passed away.  I'm still in shock and I know the hardest times are ahead, due to the fact that I at 23 years old, cannot wrap my head around what happened.  None of it feels real, and my house has been quiet as it's just my mom and I now.  

The sadness and pain comes in waves.  One moment I feel motivated to continue what I was in progress of accomplishing, notably my degree and my search for an internship.  Other moments I'm overcome by feelings of grief, sadness, guilt, nostalgia and pure pain.  I second guess how I feel because I don't know if it's the ""right"" way to feel.  Am I crying too much? Too little?  Am I wrong for even being on reddit right now? Who the fuck knows. 

I've been sleeping like shit.  A couple glasses of Canadian Club help me relax at night, in combination with a strong dose of nicotine.  My father was a smoker, and I should know better, but I'm a fucking mess. 

My father was never a big deadhead, not anywhere close to the fan that I have become anyway.  I think at first when I became interested in the dead he was worried I would go off and smoke a bunch of pot and dose and become a degenerate.  After a while, he would talk to me about the dead, share news stories via email about Dead &amp; Co and even bought me tickets for one of the shows I was going to.  I look back and wish we had gone to one together but I know it wasn't totally up his alley.  If he had to pick a favorite song by the dead it would be Box of Rain.  I'm not even totally sure if he knew Phil sang it, rather than Jerry or someone else.  He just wasn't super into them.  He preferred Springsteen, The Kinks, Aerosmith, Zeppelin &amp; the christmas music of Glen Campbell. 

I just hope a box of rain will ease my pain and love will see me through. Thank you for reading and I love this community. ",gratefuldead,1549780567,weirgarcialeshbrent,10,1,True,2019-02-10

What tracks/shows have the best drumming according to you? (and why I love Bill The Drummer),"I love Bill Kreutzmann, he is my favorite drummer and he is the main reason I started playing the drums.    
I was looking for a new instrument to pick up and I had chosen piano, so I ordered a keyboard to practice on and that was going pretty well, until I heard Bill play on the Eyes Of The World from 10/19/1974.    
Eyes Of The World has an amazing drum groove in general, and the way Billy pulls 1000 different tones from his ride cymbal is sick, but when he did the fills after the 14 minute mark, I knew I had chosen the wrong instrument.    


Bill isn't the most tight drummer ever, nor is he the most technical drummer, but he is in my opinion the most creative drummer ever.  

The way he keeps the band together even during the most far out jams is like magic, and he is really good at playing simple drum grooves with a lot of variations and accents so they don't get boring (He's Gone from Veneta for example has like 30 variations on the 2 bar kick pattern throughout the song).    
I can go on for hours but as you can see I really like Bill Kreutzmann, and its crazy that so many of the best musicians to ever live were in a band together, but the music sure shows for it.  


The drumming is going really well by now and I get to play along to some of my favorite Grateful Dead tracks (especially Eyes Of The World), which has been the most fun I've ever had.    
I'm always looking for new tracks to play along to, or just to get inspiration and learn from, so I thought I'd ask you guys :   
What is your favorite piece of Grateful Dead drumming?    


It can be from any year, obviously the solo drummer years would be most beneficial to me, but I'm also curious to hear some cool things from years where Mickey was in the band.   
I tend to feel like after 1976 the 2 man drumming that once shined during the raw psychedelic years, now isn't really needed anymore and often ends up simplifying the grooves and limiting freedom.    
I don't listen to nearly enough music outside of 72-74 to really have a strong opinion on this tho, so feel free to show me some examples of great duo drummer work, and I'd be happy to change my opinion.

The band was great, played a very fun kid friendly set, and they had a guy just running around getting the kids into it and giving out ribbons, playing with a parachute,  etc. All the kids seemed to get really into it and unlike most kid centric outings, we adults all had a good time too.

"Do you like Bobby songs? Boy, have I got a three-show run in January 1978 for you...","It's the first shows of 1978 and Jerry's voice has been shredded by laryngitis. Rumor has it that too much smoking cigarettes and heroin did his voice in.

On 1/6/1978 in San Bernardino, Jerry gives it a go during the first set, but his voice is just wrecked. By the time they finish Deal, Bobby and Donna have to take over the lead duties. Bobby takes over for the entire second set. The Truckin' is 100 percent pure adrenaline.

The band heads southward to San Diego and does two shows at the Golden Hall that are all Bobby and Donna. Because of Jerry's vocal absence, the band turns up the playing energy a notch. They are firing on all cylinders on both nights. Well worth a few hours' listen.

Jerry comes back on 1/10/1978 in LA, and his voice is haggard. I don't think it ever recovered fully after this. Perhaps they should have cancelled the run to let him recuperate, but they didn't and history is history.",gratefuldead,1549897071,GratefulDawg73,14,1,True,2019-02-11

Trivia Tuesday?,"Hey All,

I been a Deadhead pushing 40 years now.  I have been collecting Grateful Dead, GD related stuff and creating GD related stuff that whole time and continue to do so.  Recordings (tapes, Cd's, DVD's), shirts, hats, clothes, books, pictures, trinkets, etc.. You name it, I probably have it.  Time to pass along some of the accumulated stuff.  But how?

I thought a monthly trivia Grateful Dead related question might be fun for all with a little prize attached to it.  Probably nothing major but you never know.

It will be kept simple, The first Monday of every month, around 12 noon est, I'll post a picture of the prize being offered (hence, this picture)for that month's question.

The first Tuesday of the month(the next day) at 12 noon est, I'll post that months trivia GD related question (maybe some questions will be softballs, maybe a little harder for some).  The first person to post the correct answer in the comments will be the winner.  Simple.

Then I'll contact the winner through PM on reddit and get where they want it shipped to and mail it out (please domestic (US) only).  No cost what so ever to the winner, no s&amp;h cost, no go to my instagram, no follow me blah, blah, blah.  Just fun, and who knows, you might learn something along the way?  Simple.

Hopefully it will go well.  If not, it will just fadeaway.

Since we missed January and February, we will do the first one tomorrow and another one next week.

The first prize will be a compilation of some magic moments of Dead Co's Playing In The Sand in Mexico from January 2019 on CD.

Good luck to all, have fun and we'll see you tomorrow!

Christmas JRAD Fiasco/I Need a Miracle,"My lovely wife, not understanding the Dead community, paid way too much for 2 tickets to JRAD for me for Christmas.

I'm hoping someone can help us recoup some of our Christmas. She feels like crap already, as we are both school teachers with not a lot of disposable income, so I'm trying to get somewhere between face and what she paid.

Tickets are for the 1/19 JRAD show at the Capitol. Cheapest on Stubhub (ours coincidentally) are 230 each with fees. Loge left center, row cc.

NOPE. Guess I never had properly dosed acid before, or something.

Deadlist said Jerry is playing electric guitar during the song and Mike Dolgushkin (one of the authors of Deadbase) says in his review of the show Ripple is sweet,as is To Lay Me Down, where SOMEONE is playing a piano.

where to find tapes? want to start collecting,"The Archive is absolutely amazing. Spotify is incredible. I always try to snap up a Dick's Picks when I see one in the wild, and of course I hop on Dave's Picks releases. I'm privileged to be able to 

But I recently found a small punk/DIY/volunteer run shop locally that has loads of old GD boots in stock and I've had a great time purchasing and discovering them. Not only are they incredibly cheap, I feel like it's allowing me to gain a new form of Dead fandom- instead of settling on the consensus favorites or feeling overwhelmed by the infinitude of the available material on the internet, or an endless list on Headyversion, and overwhelmed and the decades I missed out on, I can find some random under the radar show and forge my own connection to particular moments. 

I also love imagining the labor of love, the dubbing and trading that went into creating this proto file-sharing network. I love the hiss, it's like a unique terroir of a fine wine or something. The labels are almost a form of folk art, too, little fake doses, or cartoons, or stamps.  It all helps me feel plugged in to the culture more. I'm already a vinyl collector and I can't think of anything better than cheap and unique relics containing some of my favorite music. I even got one that had three tracks from some mystery show tacked on the front before the actual supposed bootleg I'd purchased. Serendipity and surprise are one of the hallmarks of the Dead and I feel like this is a way for me to participate, if not firsthand, very much secondhand.

That said, I can't imagine with the miracles of the archive, streaming, etc that these tapes are often produced much these days, yet there must remain plenty in existence. Where do old heads dump their collections? I imagine, are so many Dead-related things, it is quasi-illegal to even sell these in a retail establishment, so I can't imagine a ""Dead Tapes"" section is too common.

I'm in the Twin Cities area, so I know most of the local shops here. I'll be heading to Chicago in a few weeks, anywhere I should check? Anyone have a collection they are getting rid of? Anyone cobbled their own tape collection together in this post-internet world and have any pointers? One cassette I has has some guy's phone number on it, should I just call it and see what happens?

An interesting observation:,"Something I noticed while spending time with my father (HUGE head) over the holidays: him and his buddies refer to different shows they’ve been to, heard, own on different media formats, by date AND THEY ALL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE OTHER IS TALKING ABOUT. 

Example: “I mean yeah 5/22/77 was good but in my opinion if that’s the song you’re hooked on it doesn’t get much better than 5/16/80.”

I’ve never noticed this before, and can’t think of a single other band’s following which does this. And as a 28 year old (who loves the dead but also newer music) I would never turn to a buddy and go “Dude have you heard the a day to remember set from 5/3/08? It’s so much better than the one from 9/20/10.”


It’s absolutely amazing, unless my father and his buddies are the only ones, that you all can do this. Blows my mind, especially given all the... indulgences... that were taken during that entire period. 


TL;DR: blows my mind dead heads can refer to different sets/shows by date and people know what they’re talking about.",gratefuldead,1546621216,upstatedreaming3816,36,1,True,2019-01-04

Would anyone be interested in hearing an album of GD covers played on the baritone ukulele?,"I got one for Christmas and I’m absolutely loving the tonality of the instrument. It’s so warm and rich as opposed to the bright and oftentimes annoying sounds of the tenor and concert ones (which I also have, but have grown tired of them). It’s tuned DGBE like the top 4 strings of the guitar, so I have to transcribe everything a 5th down or figure out the chords for the proper key, but i haven’t even picked up the guitar much since I got it. 

I started with Brokedown Palace because it’s one of my favorite tunes and the harmonies are great practice for my singing. Currently working on Scarlet Begonias and Uncle John’s Band (damn those harmonies are tough), and I’ve considered Crazy Fingers as my challenge after those. 

Not trying to promote myself, just wondering if there’s any interest in a different take on those GD classics we all love. I’m a drummer by trade, so it’s been really fun learning about the harmonic structure of their songs and piecing everything together. 

Hope everyone’s off to a happy, healthy, and productive 2019!

Bertha,"Someone posted a Bertha the other day, saying “A little bit of Bertha can brighten any day.“ 

As someone who just recently started listening to the shows I’m pretty amazed at how certain songs evolved over time or just had a different vibe night to night.  Bertha is one of the songs I just can’t get enough of now.  During my years of casual fandom I had only known the version from the Skull &amp; Roses album. 

The first 77 Bertha I heard was from the Boston Garden show. I had just scored some good cannabis and decided it was time to see what 5/7/77 was all about.  That Bertha opener came on and it was so chill and groovy, I couldn’t believe it. A song I had already loved just got even better. It was one of those moments where I began to understand why fans are all about listening to the shows. 

I saw that one head considered Bertha to be almost like an anthem or theme song for that spring tour in 77.  I have really been digging the ones from that time, and that Bertha opener from the Garden will probably always be my favorite, feedback and all.  Even the very next one they played, in Buffalo, is completely different, athough it sill has that chill groove that I love!

Bman hooked me up with a nice Bertha, 12/31/87. I know many heads consider it to be a special song, and that the band played it throughout their career.  It was mentioned several times in the recent thread about songs that rocked throughout the different eras. 

So I was wondering, do you have a favorite Bertha?  Anyone feel a special connection with this song? ",gratefuldead,1546813236,Celticsmoneyline,32,1,True,2019-01-06

I go to sleep listening to the dead, I wake up and listen to the dead, I'm reading books...about the dead, I'm rewatching LST for the 7th time.

High Time or Hard Time?,"Listening to Workingman's today, High Time jumped out at me. I'd swear Jerry is saying ""hard"" instead of ""high"".

What is so hypnotic about Grateful Dead music?,"I saw this question somewhere else and thought I’d share it here ... your thoughts?

Question:  What was It that was so mesmerizing or hypnotic about a Grateful Dead show or their music?

I went to see an average Dead cover band the other night, I wasn’t that impressed at first, the vocals weren’t that good, the guitarists were ok but not great.  But their drummers and bass player were outstanding and then before I knew it -I was swept up by the music- much like at Dead shows in days gone by.  It was very much like I was under the influence of the Pied Piper.  I was 100% sober. 

It got me thinking the next day.  Could it be their time signatures or polyrhythms.  The resonance of the bass?  Why does Grateful Dead music when played live create such a mass hypnosis?",gratefuldead,1546978076,AugustWest323,18,1,True,2019-01-08

Row Jimmy: A nod to Jimmy Cliff?,"I was wondering why Row Jimmy uses the name Jimmy. The reggae rhythm reminded me that the Dead and Jimmy Cliff have a friendly history including guest appearances together, so maybe it was a nod to Jimmy Cliff.

I did some googling to see if this was a widely known thing.

I didn't find anything specifically linking Jimmy Cliff to Row Jimmy, but as it happens, Cliff recorded a song called ""Many Rivers to Cross"" in 1969. It's about his struggle to make it as a young musician in the UK.

The lyrics of Row Jimmy use the struggle of rowing as a metaphor for perseverance.

 I think it's pretty safe to say that Row Jimmy was inspired by Jimmy Cliff. The name, the reggae rhythm, and the rowing metaphor all point to it.

Am I late to the party in this? Is it common knowledge? I guess it doesn't matter. I learned some things on the way and gained more appreciation for what I believe is one of the Dead's best songs.",gratefuldead,1547005095,possiblyMaybeAnother,25,1,True,2019-01-08

Want some Allman Brothers music?,"Hey all,

Over the years, I've purchased a LOT of Instant Lives from the various tours starting in 2003. I'm looking to free up some space, so I thought I'd try to sell my collection. I believe that this is in line with the band's policy, as these are CDs that I've purchased, but if it is not for some reason, I will be happy to remove the post.

I have the Instant Lives of just about every show on the summer tours from 2003 to 2014, including every single show between 2010 and 2014. I have every show of the 2006 summer tour and probably about 95% of the shows between 2006 and 2009. I'm a little lighter on the stuff from 2003-2005, I'd say I have about 75% of that. However, the chances are I'll have the show you're looking for.

Again, I am selling my copies of these Instant Lives, which is legal, and I'm pretty sure does not go against the band's policy, but please let me know if there are any issues.

nugs streams - money grabs,"OK this is kind of a short rant...  

  

I got an email from nugs last night at 10pm EST inviting me to watch the ""Winter Hootenanny"" from Terrapin Crossroads for free - A concert that was starting by the time the email was sent. Well, since I'm a somewhat normal person with a job and such, I don't really check my email after 9pm when I'm relaxing and getting ready to call it a night by 11 or 12. So I saw the email this morning when I woke up. I'm bummed to say the least - I would have LOVED to tune in to that stream last night had I known about it.  

  

Here's where the real rant comes from though... I've received probably a dozen or so emails from nugs about pre-ordering the Playing in the Sand shows over the past few months - still over a week away from the shows (streams which are ridiculously overpriced in the first place), but they can't send a single email even a day in advance for one of their free streams? C'mon man.  

  

I get it that they're a business that's just looking to make a profit and that's really the bottom line. Sending that free stream was really just a way for them to tack on the PitS stream at the bottom of the email to buy, but for company that's so intertwined with the jam band community, you would think they would at least *try* to look less cash-grabby.   

  

TL;DR: nugs sends dozens of emails about pre-ordering their overpriced Mexico streams well in advance, but sends a single email at the exact time of the show for a free stream. ",gratefuldead,1547207447,cosmicgeoffry,7,1,True,2019-01-11

2. The camping pass is listed as valid from 6/6-6/9 but the shows are only on 6/7 and 6/8.  If we arrived on 6/7 would the place already be packed? Or is it fairly empty the day before the show usually?

I have a friend traveling out here at the end of the month from a few thousand miles away and they want me to make a live Grateful Dead playlist for them to listen to on their flight.

My .02 on the Danger Situation,"I thought I would add my .02 on the matter.

 I am not going to judge this person because myself, as well as everyone else on this planet, is in no position to do so. The fact of the matter is, we all have our own demons that we are dealing with and I truly believe that most people do not intend on doing harm to others. How this person has arrived to this point in life to perceive things in the way he does is this person's business and nobody else's. 

This brings me to my next point. Obviously Danger is possibly dealing with some demons that they themselves may not even completely understand  at the moment. I personally think that if Danger truly cares about the community that he worked so hard to build over years, and I truly believe that he does, that he should step down temporarily to work on these things and come back with a fresh perspective and to allow the community to heal a bit.

 I also think that we as a community need to show some empathy towards this man as he has helped shape this community for years and it is understandable why he would be reluctant to step away. Let's show some love guys. We all have been in dark places before. I just hope that Danger sees this as an opportunity to, stealing a page from Bobby's book, take a step back temporarily and try to deal with whatever darkness plagues him. I can appreciate what he has done for us by running this subreddit and I hope others can too and not just see the bad that he has done. I for one think everyone deserves another chance especially if they are willing to use this as an opportunity to grow.

Love you guys and I hope you take care. Danger I hope you can find it within yourself to take a break, reflect, enjoy the holidays, and come back to the community that you worked so hard to build here.",gratefuldead,1543807776,foreverTomorrow_,0,1,True,2018-12-02

DO NOT BUY FROM STUBHUB (and other ticket buying tips).,"I have seen too many posts today and the last few days about how people have bought tickets on StubHub before (and even during!) the presales and general sales.  I thought I'd put together a PSA and quick guide on how to buy tickets without getting ripped off. 

First, the PSA: **NEVER BUY TICKETS FROM STUBHUB (or other most other resellers)**.  The exception here being [cashortrade.org](cashortrade.org) which I'll get into below.

Also, **NEVER BUY PLATINUM TICKETS FROM TICKETMASTER**.

So let's pretend the next tour just got announced and you want to make sure you get seats and don't get ripped off.  Here's what you do:

* First, sign up for Ticketmasters (TM) Verified Fan Presale (VFP).  The easiest way to make sure you get a chance to sign up for VFP is to sign up for the Dead &amp; Company newsletter.  Yeah, we all hate junk mail but D&amp;C will send out an email with tour dates and links to sign up for their VFP.  Any other band that uses VFP will likely do the same, so this is applicable to them as well.  You'll also be able to find links to sign up on their site if you'd rather not sign up for the newsletters.

* Your next step is to wait.  I didn't think this would really need to be explained but I've seen enough posts proving otherwise.  Just do nothing. Ticketmaster will send you an email on a certain date, usually outlined when you sign up, letting you know if you've been selected or not for the VFP.  If you have been selected you will get a text message 2 hours before on-sale time to buy your tickets.  Tickets will be posted to StubHub and other third party vendors before the presale even starts.  No matter how antsy you are to get tickets do not fall for the trap and  **DO NOT BUY FROM STUBHUB**.  

* If you have not been selected or you are waitlisted for the VFP do not worry.  It's not a big deal.  Many people claim TM is releasing crappier seats during the VFP to take advantage of eager fans.  I personally think this may be half true.  One thing that is true is that TM is definitely not releasing all the seats and will be holding many for general sales.  So, no VFP, what do you do now?

* Now you wait again.  And no matter how much your brain is telling you to go to StubHub to get ripped off, do not do it.  See if there are other presales happening.  Depending on the venue there may be AmeEx Presales, Citi Presales, Local Preseales, Siriux Presales, etc.  TM will list all the presales as well as their dates and times.  See if any are applicable to you or if you can Google around for codes.  For the credit card presales you will actually need to check out with that specific type of card, so a code won't work for those, but you get the idea.

* Can't find a code or you're not eligible for any of the presales?  Still, don't worry.  Keep waiting until general on sale.  There will still be plenty of tickets available during the general sale.

* Tickets sold out too fast during general sale or you couldn't get the specific section you wanted?  No worries, tickets are now sold 6-7 months in advance so you have plenty of time to secure a seat.  But, I'd start searching on [cashortrade.org](cashortrade.org) at this point.  This is a third party site but you're buying/selling directly with other fans and you're only ever allowed to charge or pay the actual face value of the ticket or less.  This is a legitimate website which I have used dozens of times without a single issue.  It is especially popular with the jam band crowd so you'll find tickets for plenty of other shows  In fact, for shows that aren't even sold out yet I still look there first as I see it as a way to help someone out who's just looking to make their money back for one reason or another and I'm not giving more money to TM.

* Can't find anything on Cash or Trade?  Keep waiting.  When the show starts getting a bit closer more and more posts will pop up.  So keep checking back.  Or maybe sign up for a Gold membership with them so you can be alerted when posts matching your requirements appear.  Also, it's a good idea to check back in with TM periodically as they sometimes release more seats closer to the show date.  They will also sometimes release packages for cheaper seats.  Like a 4 pack of lawns for $100.  Or, they start dropping the prices of their Platinum tickets that haven't sold back to standard ticket prices.  I guess I should also note that you should **never buy Platinum tickets** from TM.

* Remember how I was saying you should never buy tickets from StubHub?  There actually is one exception.  Closer to show dates when the scalpers can't sell their tickets they will start dropping ticket prices pretty drastically just get whatever they can back on those tickets.  I'm talking like a week out here.  Ticket prices typically stay highly inflated and start dropping around 3 weeks before the show date and usually are cheapest about a week and up to the day of the show.  Many times going for less than face value, especially on lawn tickets and less desirable pavilion tickets.  If you can buy from StubHub for less than face this is the one time you should, as the scalper is actually losing money on these seats.

* No tickets for for at or less than face on StubHub?  Then show up to the venue and you will find people selling tickets in the lot for face or less.  

So, to sum it up:

1. Sign up for TM Verified Fan Presale.  Wait for presale.
2. Still no tickets or not eligible?  Wait.  Look into other presales you're eligible for.
3. Buy during next presale.  Still no tickets?  Wait.
4. Buy during general sale.  
5. Couldn't snag tickets in general sale? Try [CashOrTrade.org](cashortrade.org), check back on TM periodically.
6. Still no luck?  Wait until the show date is close then, and only then, check StubHub for tickets at or less than face (1-3 weeks out).
7.  Can't find tickets for face or less on StubHub?  Buy them on lot.

Ticketmaster Tips:

* If you don't have a TM account create one, you'll need one for the VFP anyway.  
* Add a credit card to your profile and be signed in BEFORE tickets go on sale.
* Get the Ticketmaster app on your cell phone.  I sometimes have better luck on mobile than desktop
* If it's a multi-night stand, I like to buy Saturday tickets first as they tend to sell out faster than Friday.

Rationalizing ticket prices?,"Anyone else feel a little heat with the pricing?

Looking at presale at some of these giants venues.  Tickets on lawns/nosebleeds are $45 plus fees - certainly fair.  

The thing is, you're watching the band on a screen and the sound quality is abhorrent (generally).  I remember listening back to a show on Sirius from last summer and the quality was night and day compared to what I heard live.

Tickets closer to the soundboard/stage start at $150 + fees which seems like quite a lot to spend on a single evening.

"Grayfolded, The ultimate Dark Star?","Plunderphonics
John Oswald 
Mystery Lab

I remember having to send a cashier's check to Canada, to get Transitive Axis many, many years ago. Then waiting to get Mirror Ashes, while inprisioned, for a cannabis charge, far from Family and Friends. 
In the end, been able to listen to every 'Dark Star' from '69-'96 layered over one another, stretched, compressed, folds and manipulates without equaninmity a band whose aesthetic from the go embraced the previous uncharted territory in 2 CD's total of 106.05 minutes. It's such a tremendous  pleasure to listen to a meta-""Dark Star"". 
As Robert Hunter spoke about Grayfolded ""What the Dead go on 'Dark Star' is what the Dead are, that's what they do best. What defines the Dead is 'Dark Star'.""
""Starting Grayfolded with layered tuning sections combining at least one hundred members of the Dead was a stroke of genius.  Ending the whole work was much more difficult. After the drum swarm one can hear in typical Dead-jamming-style various members of the band suggestions various places to go. At several points ""The Other One"" seems to be knocking at the door; one also heads traces of ""St. Stephen"", ""Morning Dew"", ""Eyes on the World"" and ""Stella Blue"". 

Oswald approched Grayfolded as a virgin to the Grateful Dead experience, only seeing the Dead twice, once before Transitive Axis and last before Mirror Ashes.

- frequency of performance (“Ripple” was rarely played, and “Brokedown Palace” was only used as a special occasion / encore tune after ‘74)

- performed with both the GD and the JGB (seems to me a tune should get bonus points if done with both bands: this is a mark against “Stella Blue”)

Dancing to the Grateful Dead,"I never got to see the Dead. I didn't see Jerry. I was 2 years old when Jerry passed away. A friend of mine introduced me to the dead about 6 years ago (I am 25 now). My first show was at Blossom on the Dead and Co. 2017 tour. By the time the show was over and I was driving back to my hotel I literally had a migraine from all of the culture shock that I had just been through discovering my first ""dead show"". I was fascinated and hooked. What intrigued me the most about my experience was seeing how the music brought people to dance. The man who turned me on to the dead, a mentor, would sometimes mention ""spinners"". He toured with the dead during the early 90's where he witnessed the tail end of the Church of Unlimited Devotion, or so I assume. When I go to a Dead and Co. or Dark Star Orchestra show I am automatically drawn to the groups of people dancing. I have danced a few times myself. I always assumed that dosing had something to do with the dancing experience (I am not a doser) but I have been told that dosing is not a requirement. When I am at a show, and even at home, I feel this huge energy inside of me. I feel that I soak up the energy from the music and the crowd and it just builds up inside of me and I feel like I just want to break free, start running with no destination, jump and gyrate, just something to release the energy that is built up inside of me. I really want to learn how to be a ""spinner"". I have done some research and it has led me to the Whirling Dervishes which I believe is where the original spinners learned their techniques. I am looking for some way to learn and practice this way of dancing that will allow for me to ultimately experience the music and the energy that I feel. If anyone has any information on this form of dancing or the spinners I would be so grateful to have it. Personally, I feel that those who dance to the dead have not gotten their fair share of attention throughout the years. There should be a documentary on Grateful Dancing. Thank You.

Is this the case with Europe ‘72?

The death of Pigpen,So everyone always basically says Pig drank himself to death. I feel like it's pretty hard to actually do that. Sure if you mix in a bunch of other drugs or wrap your car around a tree or drown or something but just to die because of your health seems a bit early. Wikipedia says he had a rare genetic liver condition unrelated to his drinking. It sounds like even now people with that condition don't exactly love long full lives let alone back in the early 1970s. It sounds to me like Pig may have bought him self a few extra years of he never drank but I sure don't think he would be touring with Bobby and the boys this summer if he never drank. If this is true it kind of seems unfair to him that everyone always says he drank himself to death. Am I way off base? ,gratefuldead,1544558710,Redm18,49,1,True,2018-12-11
Any good hotel recommendations for the Boulder Co Folsom Field shows?,"So the wife and I decided to get crazy and plan a summer vacation around the tour closing shows in Boulder. I've never been to Colorado before and thus have absolutely zero clue of what I'm doing. 

Can anyone recommend any good hotels that are relatively close to the venue? Is public transportation an option for getting to and from the shows? 

Ideally I would like to stay at a place that others attending the show are also staying at. 

Also if anyone has any good recommendation for things to do while we are in Boulder, post them here! We plan on spending the whole week there and capping our trip off with the two shows on Friday and Saturday!

We grabbed the cheapest seats (the seated general admission ""Blue"" areas that are farther from the stage). It was the only way we could afford to do both shows so I'm hoping the seats are at least adequate!

I'm a day one Google Music Play Shared Family Plan subscriber. I have been through some shit but all and all GMP has been a good service, I use it everyday.

I also have a few Google Home around my house. For the most part I never have an issue with our Google Home. Until the last update...lol

I want Google Home to play the song Uncle John's Band by the Grateful Dead. Uncle John's Band by the Grateful Dead is the first song on the album Workingman's Dead I can get it to play every song on that album by name except Uncle John's Band by the Grateful Dead. The only way I can get it Uncle John's Band to play is to ask Google Home to play the whole album, then it plays. When I finally recorded a video of the issue, GH played two Grateful Dead songs but the wong songs, but most of the time it play totally random shit from random bands. I got like chanting once etc.

I ask it how it's doing to make sure its working - It says hi etc
I ask it to play the Grateful Dead Uncle John's Band
Its starts playing music, I ask what song is this? Its playing West LA Fade Away (live) by the Grateful Dead
I ask it to play Uncle John's Band by the Grateful Dead (the opposite way I asked previously)
Its starts playing music, I ask what song is this? Its playing Bob Weir - Cassidy of off ACE
I ask it to play Cumberland Blues by the Grateful Dead &amp; It does play it
I ask it to play Workingman's Dead and It Plays Uncle John's Band (quietly, but it's finally playing)
I then ask Google What the fuck it's problem is....

"4/3/82 in Norfolk, VA","I was making my way through some ‘80s AUD recordings recently and wanted to flag this show from VA. Second set gets a little ragged but the first set features incredible playing from Jerry in particular. TLEO, Big River, Peggy-O, Bird Song (the point at which the first set would have ended if they were phoning it in), All Over Now, Let It Grow... Jerry smokes them all. The show is also worth checking for a strange version of Eyes with an odd rhythmic approach. This is the second date on a two week tour of the east coast and plays into the theory that the band played great shows in out of the way places like Norfolk, VA. In a just exactly perfect GD twist of humor, they didn’t even play “Promised Land.”",gratefuldead,1541429506,djbillyfrazier,27,1,True,2018-11-05

Hello All - I have never been on Reddit until now, a friendly and fellow fan suggested that I reach out. So here I am ... trying to catch, the collective ear.

… Life has thrown me one of it’s curveballs /slash/ hand grenades. I am reeling and looking for lifelines however I can. I am not a man of means, what I do have is my collection of Grateful Dead music, which represents one of my great loves in this life, it is the most valuable thing that I own. So sometimes it is like that, this life. ... and there is, reluctantly, a great need - and my options are limited. So I am trying to sell my collection. I appreciate all of those that have already reached out in that loving way that deadheads do. 

I Love the Dead ... there is real magic and catharsis and uplift and openness in the way they exchanged value with the world - in fact, in so many ways - ways that I am deeply proud of – that value is now in me, that particular embodiment and expression that is both unique and universal of the Grateful Dead. 

“Can't talk to you without talking to me  
 We're guilty of the same old things  
 Thinking a lot about less and less  
 And forgetting the love we bring”  
   
 That is Magic to me - That innate and inherent invitation -to our better selves - to leading from the sweeter places inside us - while laying plain the accompanying world-commentary and matter of fact-ness. And the music - the music - that human ache to make and reach into splendor. I am grateful that i was, and still am, lucky enough to have ears that hear. 

I started seeing the Dead back in ’85 and the music – hot diggity dog you all know about the music. And, as well, you know that along with the music, is a marriage, to the lovely and warm hearted beauty of the community. That nourishment of both band and fans, which has in many ways helped me become the man I am today. I love that, this unspoken bond of delight and warmth and joy and shared understanding of what it means to try and lift someone’s spirit … the expansion - Love.

If you or someone you know would appreciate this treasure please do direct them to the ebay link below. I am in need, and also feel not especially comfortable with charity … what with the world as it is. There are many many in need out there/ in here. I feel more aligned with an exchange of value. – where I also have at least something – even partially - to be offered. It is not my preference to sell this collection – I am trying to place balm on a challenging piece of life. If I could, I would …

All the Best to You and to Yours, and Thank You for reading.

‘Winter rain, now tell me why  
 Summers fade and roses die  
 The answer came, the wind and rain

Golden hills now veiled in gray  
 Summer leaves have blown away  
 Now what remains, the wind and rain

And like a desert spring my lover comes and spreads her wings  
 (Knowing)  
 Like a song that's born to soar the sky  
 (Flowing)  
 Till the waters all are dry  
 (Growing)  
 The loving in her eyes

Circle songs and sands of time  
 And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme  
 And little change, the wind and rain

And like a desert spring my lover comes and spreads her wings  
 (Knowing)  
 Like a song that's born to soar the sky  
 (Flowing)  
 Till the rivers all are dry  
 (Growing)  
 The loving in her eyes

Winter gray and falling rain  
 We'll see summer come again  
 Darkness fall and seasons change  
 (Gonna happen every time)  
 Same old friends the wind and rain  
 (We'll see summer by and by)  
 Winter gray and falling rain  
 (Summers fade and roses die)  
 We'll see summer come again  
 (Like a song that's born to soar the sky)

Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore  
 Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door 

See the sun sparkle in the reeds; silver beads pass into the sea

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter  
 She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water  
 And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her  
 Let it flow, greatly flow, wide and clear

Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field  
 Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal   
 Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring; black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing  
 As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing  
 That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing  
 Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield (note 3)

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name  
 As well to count the angels dancing on a pin  
 Water bright as the sky from which it came  
 And the name is on the earth that takes it in  
 We will not speak but stand inside the rain  
 And listen to the thunder shout  
 I am, I am, I am, I am

So it goes, we make what we made since the world began  
 Nothing more, the love of the women, work of men  
 Seasons round, creatures great and small, up and down, as we rise and fall’

Shower thoughts on GD and brown M&amp;Ms.,If you listen to a few GD shows from the early days it becomes clear why a band like Van Halen had the brown M&amp;Ms clause in their rider. I feel like at least in the early days the dead would have had a somewhat simple show just guys playing instruments and singing and yet when you listen to early recordings it seems like something is always messed up. It's usually the sound monitors but often also the lighting on stage and crowd management. I can't imagine some of these venues putting on shows with explosives and crazy lighting etc. It must have been terrifying for bands which seems to be why the bands but all kinds of crazy checks in their riders. I think it's also why they build the wall of sound and why they basically only let their guys set it up. ,gratefuldead,1541538655,Redm18,11,1,True,2018-11-06

The Year in Review: 2018 Dave's Picks,"I just wrapped up a full re-listening session of all four Dave's Picks from 2018 and wanted to share some thoughts and discuss this batch with some fellow fans.  


**Dave's Picks 25:** 11/6/77: This show keeps breaking my heart, man. That first set is legitimately one of the best ever. The Half-Step may be the GOAT, Tennessee Jed is straight heat, a rare Dupree's (and a rockin' one at that), and even Mexicali Blues smokes. Then the second set starts... Samson actually rages and the Sunrise is about as good as that song can be, but the big jams that look so promising in the track list seem strained. It seems like Jerry came out disoriented and nothing (including Scarlet Fire and Not Fade Away) could really achieve true liftoff. Truckin' kind of saves the day, but it's too little too late. A good show for the series, but not nearly as good as it could be. **3.5/5**  


**Dave's Picks 26**: 11/17/71: When this was announced, my first thought was ""Ugh, more '71?"" Then it showed up in my mailbox. Wow. This set just delivers on all fronts. Keith is at this perfect place where he's meshed in with the band, but he still sounds energized and enthusiastic. His fills and licks make some of the more rinse and repeat first set tunes shine, and the band seems to be in fine form right along with him. The major jams (Other One, NFA) deliver at every twist and turn. The third disc and the bonus disc give us a similar show but with Pig Pen back sharing keyboard duty, and it's a real treat to hear Peg's organ with Keith's keys -- a rare combo that really shines on this particular release. One of my favorites from the series thus far. **4.5/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**Dave's Picks 27**: 9/2/83: This show is so weird and I totally love it. The vocals may be rough and the mix has its quirks, but I'm a real sucker for Jerry's raunchy 80s tone, and the playing here is pretty inspired. The first set has some real fun highlights, namely the Big Railroad Blues and the Looks Like Rain&gt;Deal, the latter song being particularly hot. After an inauspicious start with a nearly unlistenable Help on the Way, Slipknot brings in the jams and they pretty much never let up from there. The Estimated Eyes combo delivers as always, Space is fantastic, and the post-Space suite is incredibly inspired from start to finish, with my personal favorite performance of Black Peter wrapping a nice bow on everything. It's not a perfect show, but it ticked a lot of my personal boxes and I enjoy this one a lot. **4/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**Dave's Picks 28**: 6/17/76: To me, this show is the definition of just OK. The playing is sharp, the song selection is satisfying, but the band isn't taking any real chances and there's a reason you don't see anything from this show on HeadyVersion. It's not a bad show by any means, it's just very forgettable save for a pretty cool Let It Grow jam. I've listened to this one the least, so maybe it will evolve with more listens, but for now, it's not one I see myself returning to much. **3/5**

Next big box = NYE?!,"I believe the last mega-box was 30 Trips, released in 2015 - we should be due for another. My vote for the next Big Box release is every New Year’s show! Some are at (or below) average - I’m looking at you, mid-80’s - but most of them are fantastic. Many feature such rarities as rare songs, special guests, 3rd sets, acoustic sets etc. And for my money it should include the Allman Bros 12/31/73 3rd set with Jerry and Bill (if you ain’t heard that yet, get it - there’s an excellent SBD of the full show out there.) 

Yes we do have most of these shows in circulation - but maybe something like 12/31/66 is hiding in the vault? Even so, it would be a worthy candidate for a cool box set with room for the obvious bonuses like hats, noise makers, balloons, etc. I hope Dave has considered this for an eventual release - the NYE shows have always been among the most popular and it would be an interesting alternative take on the band evolution as demonstrated with 30 Trips.

I'm putting my Art on Clothes to Fund a Couple Dead and Co Concerts,"Hey guys,

I'm a long time reader of this forum, but never a poster... I've been watching from the sidelines long enough! So quick introduction, I'm Jordan. Currently in school. I live all the way up north in Canada (brrrr), and most importantly, I'm a HUGE Dead fan.

This past summer I had posted some art on Instagram and Mr. Mayer ended up sharing it on his story (ahhhhh I know). I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, and figured I might as well give my art a chance. I've never done anything with it, and people seem to like it, so I figured I might as well try starting up a wee business. Would love to hear your feedback on the stuff, or any comments, or support really! As I mentioned earlier, I'm a student (so read broke), and I'm hoping to put any of these sales to fund a couple dead and co tickets (margins are really tiny so it's not really about the money... I make like $2 off each sale, I rather have a more affordable price and have someone wearing my shirt than a little more money in my pocket).

I'm releasing the store on the 15th of this month, and I'll be dropping 5 pieces with that. You can follow the adventures on Instagram @deadfrankly . Any support I would be forever grateful for. So give a scroll below and let me know what you dead heads think!

It's so visual and surreal and expressive in it's jams, with everyone in the band being totally ON and in tune with each other. 
Here's what I mean: 
0-5:00 Floating and being in space for while the dark star is conceived
6-10:30 the dark star is formed and building itself as it increases in velocity
11:05-16 the dark star enters into another dimension and over the horizon we see that it is heading for its final destination: EARTH
18:00 Dark star crashes, leaving silence and everything as we know it left in a smoldering floating rubble
18:01- A wave erupts in the cosmos at 24:07 and the Debris starts to form into mini dark stars and make their own journey
24:08- end Hurtling through time and space, the dark stars collide into each other to form a cosmic 2001 space odyssey baby overlooking Earth in a different dimension, thus going into eyes of the world
Can you tell I really really LOVE this version? Stay blessed family 🌹💀",gratefuldead,1541981993,PepperoniPlayboy19,16,1,True,2018-11-11

If you have ever toured: Did you find yourself making up nicknames for people you saw on a regular basis but were just too lazy to ask for the 20th time?,"I have a list and venues. My tour buddies would all recognize. 

&amp;#x200B;

Starz Dude (Henry J Kaiser 1987)

Padagonia (Philly 86)

Purple Bud Dude (Oakland 91) 

&amp;#x200B;

And the killer?   Mr. Fin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Fin NY Run Oakland 1987.

  Myself and a friend were in the midst of a NYE run in Oakland \[Eve ticketless\] when after we both dosed, we separated like usual. We were tour pals. Common knowledge was that after 'liftoff', find each other later at the hotel.  No worries. 

&amp;#x200B;

 We dosed, we lost each other in \[fill in acid time frame\] Aaaaaand they're off! 

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I remember is being on the outer ring of the BIG DRUM of the Oakland Collesium next to a satellite speaker surrounded by 5-foot high chicken wire.  Cool enough, I'm tripping and that speaker won't bite me. My friend Matt? No idea don't care. I am almost in orbit! 

&amp;#x200B;

\[Insert acid time\] Maybe second set same location? I find myself next to a strange tall dude. I know, I am tripping so they are all strange. But I'm calibrated. And I was right! \[Acid reality\] Out of nowhere new dude grabs a dollar bill out of his pocket and crumples it up. He holds it for a second then tosses it over the chicken wire fence surrounding my dancing speaker god. I'm tripping balls. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, that was weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

He did it again. 

&amp;#x200B;

And again. Mow, again, we are in acid time so factor all this in. So let's say he did this 2 more times. Two times too many ok. I have to add that this dollar bill dude is doing this like a robot. He never looks at the bill. He just pulls out the Geo Washington, crumples it and tosses it over the ...chicken wire fence.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now in my head, I have to manage this. I am jamming to Scarlet, tripping my ass off, and this dude is literally tossing money away and I am the only one that sees this? Ok. It's over. 

&amp;#x200B;

NOT! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still there. He is still there. He's been good. Then during whatever the last song was, he so non chalantly breaks out a five dollar bill. My eyes fixate on this new development instantly! A five dollar bill? And in slow motion, he does not crumple it. He carefully folds it into quarters. \[Acid time\] He then (without looking) just let's go of the folded fin as I watch it drift to the sticky floor of the Collesium. Still not looking his left foot covers the money just as it hits the floor. This is pure sorcery! 

&amp;#x200B;

A new LSD clock kicked in. Why did he just take out a five dollar bill, fold it, let go of it, then step on it perfectly without looking? Oh yeah, I am TRIPPING! 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I wait to see if this is real. did this guy just do this? No one else finds this behavior odd? What the fuck.. Ok...He'll just pick his foot up and this will be over. Nope. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's like Sugar Mags or something like that and his left foot is stuck to the floor stuck t the fiver and the right foot is the Boogie Down Bronx! I'm thinking stop and lift that fucking foot! Now I'm jammin, sweating, tripping and Fin Boy won't show me the fucking money! Why is he torturing me?!! 

&amp;#x200B;

The song ended the lights came up. I froze. Fin froze. He never looked down. With his magic radar, he squatted head level and grabbed the folded five dollar bill. He shoved it in his pocket and walked away forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the show back at Camp Hotel I found my buddy Mat and as we stared at the moving stucco ceiling, we shared stories like we always do.  Of course, I launched into Fiver Fin Dollar guy. He will tell me how hard I was tripping. Suprise!

&amp;#x200B;

By the second line, my friend Matt finished the story for me. It turns out we were never really separated. We were actually about 20 feet apart with Fin Dollar Boy and Chicken Wire fence between us. We saw the same exact story, we both thought it was unreal. But it was. 

&amp;#x200B;

We always refer to him as Fin.

Review of Voodoo Dead this weekend,"I went to Night 2 at the Gothic theater. Should have gone to both nights, but we all make mistakes.  

These guys came to play! Wow! Smokin set and everyone on fire.  Honestly didn't know the first song of the night, but quickly realized it must be JGB.  That's what love will do.  Once Jackie started singing with all that soul the place exploded.  The New Speedway Boogie-Other one, Althea with Oteil on vox, and Shakedown Street, Tore Up, and Turn on your love light were the highlights for me,

Getting to see Jeff and Oteil within arms reach was just amazing. Oteil does not get to showcase how good he is with Dead and Co.  His playing with the drummer who I believe is Steve Kimocks's young son was on point!  What a groove all night.  They were so synced in.  The kid brought so much energy to the songs.  No knock on Bill and Mickey, but these songs really come alive when they pace is right, and not dragging.  He drove it home every song!  Jeff seemed to be having an all around place and let loose.  Was possibly very high by the end of the night. Cool to see SK again, while he can rock it, it seemed he was more just a long for the ride. And Jackie is just an all around top notch performer, guitar player, and singer.   The vocals on Speedway and Shakedown give me goosebumps sitting here typing.  

I love Jackie Greene and have to attribute him to me getting into Grateful Dead in the first place.  I saw him about 12 years ago, and he played Sugaree and a couple other Dead tunes at his show.  I went home and found a couple GD versions and thus my path to now, but I digress.

11/05/18 - Bob &amp; Wolf Bros Show @ The Ryman write-up (late sorry),"Wow....Bobby played his heart out @ The Ryman (as always)

The 730 start time was perfect.  All of us Deadheads had time to get off work, eat, mingle around outside, hit the merch table and grab a beer.  I will be honest....I would rather see Bobby and this group than see Dead and Co right now.  3 man band was awesome.  Bobby was spot on all night with his guitar playing.

Set list:
1st Set
Hell in a Bucket
Mama Tried
Only a River
She Belongs to Me
Tennessee Jed
Black-Throated Wind
Lost Sailor
Saint of Circumstance

2nd set:
My Creole Belle
Friend of the Devil
Me &amp; Bobby McGee
Easy Answers
Eyes of the World
You Win Again
New Speedway Boogie
Days Between
Throwing Stones
Touch of Grey

E - US Blues

S1
Hell in a bucket was the Opener.......in all of my Dead shows over the years, I have never had a Bucket opener but it was a great way to get everyone up and dancing.
Mama Tried - while in Nashville why not play some Merle....a crowd favorite.  The Ryman voices were sounding great on this one.
Only a River - one of my favs off Blue Mountain....Bobby puts so much heart into this song.  I love to pick up my guitar and jam to this one often...
She Belongs to Me - one of the show highlights!  One of my favorite Bob Dylan covers the Dead and Bob has done over the years.  Absolutely loved it!
Tennessee Jed - In Tennessee, need I say more.  The Ryman was in full chorus on this one.  Loud!  House lights came on several times on this one.
Black-Throated Wind - This one has been a fav for several years but a couple of summers ago I saw BW do this one at a Dead and Co show in ATL and watching BW sing this one really helps me see the feeling behind this one.
Lost Sailor / Saint - never been on my radar as a show fav but lately I had been really listening to this pair of tunes lately and I loved the soft tones of Lost Sailor.  Some really funky, light playing by BW on this one.  The 3 man band really hit it together on this one....Lane and Was were synced perfectly on Lost S.  ""Drifting and Dreaming"" - Ending S1 with Saint was a great way to close the first set ""This must be heaven"".

S2
My Creole Belle - this was new one for me but BW brought out some guests which was super cool.  John Oates (from Hall &amp; Oates), and Buddy Miller.  This was super cool but it took them a min to get the sound just right.
Friend of the Devil - w/ (John Oates) - another highlight of the show.....saw BW do this one in '14 with Ratdog here at the Ryman and the Ryman was in full chorus again.  Bob and Oates played this one like they had played together several times.  BW grabbed his acoustic and they took off.  I think the whole auditorium knew every word.  It was great.
Me and Bobby McGee - w/ Margo Price (local) - another Nashville favorite and one BW likes to play from waay back.  Easy one for the Nashville crowd to sing along with.
Easy Answers - BW dug back to some Ratdog days again and pulled out Easy...nice Jazzy funky tune.  BW, Lane and Was had some really great jams on this one.  Great tune to grab a beer and jam along with.  A lot of dancing in the isles on this one.
Eyes of the World - show highlight - was not expecting this one with a 3 man band.  Wow, was I impressed and BW had some awesome jams on this song.  Over 13:00 it was the longest track of the show.  Set back and enjoy this one.  Lot's of dancing and singing....wow it was awesome!
You Win Again - w/ Buddy Miller again.  This was cool and Buddy Miller has such a wonderful sound when he plays.
New Speedway Boogie - perfect song to get everyone back on their feet and dancing again.  Another show surprise.  Not one of my GD favorites but it was a fun one that everyone knew and Ryman chorus was back up in full effect.
Days Between - w/ Buddy again - 1st time ever seeing this one played live in person.  A lot of heart and feeling in this one.  With Buddy playing his ghostly guitar this one really struck me as an awesome GD tune.  
Throwing Stones - have seen this one recently with Bobby and Campfire and JRAD and it is great to see in person at a show.  With voting day the next day....this one seemed to have a political way about it - get out and vote!
Touch of Grey - Show highlight! - Been since '95 but I saw the Grateful Dead play this in Birmingham, AL.  One of my all time GD favs.  Lot's of singing and dancing here.  This was an awesome 2nd set and what a way to close it!  

E - US Blues - been a while since I had seen this one in person and it was a great way to close the night.  ""Wave that flag""!!

Dead To Me NEW EPISODE! Episode 4: Punk Is Dead,"New episode! Hope you dig it.

&amp;#x200B;

At first blush, the Grateful Dead have nothing to do with punk and metal. Or do they? Ed and Casey look at the surprising ways the Dead connect to other musical movements on the underground and elsewhere. Have the walls separating punk, hardcore, metal and jam finally come down? We brought in two special guests to help us investigate. Jay Coyle is the founder of Music Geek Services and an instructor at Berklee Online. He talks about the Dead’s trailblazing direct-to-fan efforts and how DIY became the going rate in today’s music marketplace. Michael Brunetto is a self-professed “metal kid” and musician who shares his experiences as a longtime Deadhead who also loves the heavier stuff. Plus another Feed Your Head, this time featuring punk rock icon and Deadhead Henry Rollins.

Ann Coulter and Tucker Carlson are Dead Heads and it's awesome we are so diverse. BE KIND,"We always talk about how ""Diversity is our strength"", except when it comes to diversity of thought. I have seen the attacks on some of the other posts talking about excommunicating Ann and Tucker because they don't think exactly the same as the mainstream. People are assuming and speculating how Jerry wouldn't allow them to be a part of the family.  

It's disgusting to see these people talk about ""Hippie Values"" as if the Grateful Dead was just about hippies. Lol . Some people enjoy the music and don't have to attack people for what they believe. These people who are against diversity of thought are much more dangerous than any stupid racist. With racism, it's not like the message spreads you know. Most people don't like racists. Yes conservatives are against judging people via race too. With prejudice towards free thinkers, this message is spreading and it is very hateful. Recently some of the most hateful people I have met have been bigoted Dead Heads, who hate conservatives. They actually were threatening violence towards people who don't share their opinions, they would lie about the other person's position to call them racist or a bigot. When actually they agree that racism is bad.   


If you are a Dead Head and think it is ok to marginalize conservatives for loving this music. You are worse than a racist. You are a phony free thinker, and have no moral superiority. I welcome people from all over the thought spectrum and think healthy debate is what allows people to tune their positions.   


We must resist this type of behavior and call it out when we see it. I am no longer going to stand by and let hateful phony dead heads talk down and threaten other family for not being progressive.   


Thank you Ann Coulter and Tucker Carlson for introducing fresh faces to our great music and I hope both of you get a chance to see Dead and Co.  Also I hope that other dead heads can actually practice what they preach and realize diversity of thought is more important than any other diversity. BE KIND  


QUIT BEING HATEFUL AND PHONY   
Very sad to see the Grateful Dead community fall this low to attack people like this. GROW UP and KNOCK IT OFF  
We are supposed to be welcoming and kind. Next time I goto a show I don't want to see any of your progressive hate while I am dosed. ""Whoaooh what I now know, is U R NOT KIND"" Not even close, hate filled hearts who pretend to have the moral high ground, but you don't.

First chords of Dark Star comes on. I go ""grateful dead dark star"" then he says ""are you sure? Sounds like The Who"" I then listen more and it's a new version of dark star I've never heard without jerry or Bob's voice and the lyrics in a different or with new lyrics added.

"Getting ""it""","As a head, what does the term ""getting it"" mean to you? 

I never really understood this but I think I understand somewhat by me not liking the dead that much when I first heard that Casey Jones on a greatest hits album and trying to get into them for a little after. Longer and longer it took, the more and more I listened to the Dead. Eventually it became an obsession about the history and music, now I listen to it religiously daily. Considered myself all in after I went to my first show this summer. 

But I never had a standout moment where I sat down and ""got it"" per se, I always thought I just understood the music.

It is basically a huge wide photograph of the entire band playing, from Phil on the left to Brent on the right. Took place during the 80s - early 90s since Brent was in the photo, pretty sure Jer was playing Tiger but I could be wrong.

It used 5-8-77 as an example of talking to the audience, Bobby’s “take a step back game”. This was beautifully demonstrated as well in Dicks Picks Vol. 8 where everyone is just goofin’ around.

Dead To Me Episode 2: The Evil Dead is out today!,"New episode just in time for Halloween!

&amp;#x200B;

People tend to think of the Grateful Dead as a hippie band spreading sunshine and light. While the good vibes are for real, there’s also an otherworldly darkness in throughout their story. For the Halloween edition of Dead to Me, Casey and Ed take a look at everything from the occult ambience in the early scene to the band’s hair-raising improvisations. Special guest Jason George, a longtime taper and horror buff, talks about Jerry Garcia’s love of the macabre and how the Dead embraced the uncanny. Feed Your Head profiles the academics who conducted mass-ESP experiments at six Dead concerts in 1971. Happy Halloween!

What are the shows like? Any extraordinary experiences? I have never seen them live, but I'd love to hear your takes. How do the Dead and Co. shows differ to the Grateful Dead shows?

"Lyrical motif: ""Song(s) of [one's] own""","I noticed an interesting motif throughout a number of Hunter's lyrics about *songs of one's own.*  I haven't heard anyone point these out before, but I think its recurrence throughout the years (1970, 1973, and 1986) definitely suggests that this notion, whatever it is, is an important one to Hunter.

Which song is a generic fan favorite?,"Hey Deadheads

I am writing a short story in which the main character inherited an original pair of concert drum sticks of Bill Kreutzmann's (I am assuming he used to throw (and or throws ;) his sticks to the crowd like any other drummer...?). As she (like myself which is why I have to ask you guys for help, sorry) is not a big fan of The Grateful Dead herself, she is just about to sell them to this mysterious businessman-cum-hobo in a falafel shop when this song by GD comes on...

I need it to NOT be one of their mainstream hits that anybody will know. But also I am not asking for YOUR personal favorite - more like what you believe to be the average fan favorite. Thanks in advance!",gratefuldead,1539375973,nolmathi,33,1,True,2018-10-12

Thank You To This Subbreddit,"So a quick story.

I use to be stationed with this guy back in the day and deployed with him to Iraq. We both worked closely together and when I get out, he chose to stay in. Fast forward three years and he's currently deployed overseas. We keep in touch and he's able to post brief status updates to assure people he's fine and what not. That was until about almost a month ago. I can't go into specific details about what happened, but long story short, someone ransacked where he slept and stole a bunch of his personal belongings, including his mp3 player that he had. His wife reached out to me and asked for my help since I collect music as a hobby, asking if I had any Grateful Dead in my collection so she can get it off to him quickly since that what he chose to listen to while over there for the next couple of months. Honestly, I'm a 31 year old black guy from South Carolina, they were on my radar to collect one day because I could see how they are popular; but that wasn't going to be anytime soon. But I made it a mission to find everything I could in a couple of weeks so that we can get it off to him by today so he can get it in a timely manner.

So my journey began to acquire this discography.

And let me just say, holy shit dude, I did not know how massive their discography was. I have this initial phase where I just do my research on whoever I'm looking for and I was not expecting them have so many live albums. Initially I thought they were all just the same performances like any other artist, but how wrong I was. Besides the couple of blogs that I saw with people dedicating their love to GD, this sub showed me that this band just isn't your typical band and their live albums just aren't retelling's of tracks that were made popular. Dave's &amp; Dick's picks really opened my eyes to that when I was reading up on threads here and why people loved certain CD's from certain shows. You guys and your discussions about how and why you fell in love with them when you went to concerts as young teens / late adults are great to read.

If you're going to do a sub for an artist / band, then this sub is the template for doing it the right way.

I always buy my music, but as anyone can see, most of, (if not all), these albums are limited editions. So I broke my cardinal rule and I went on a quest to find the best copies so that I can send it off to my friend, (who bought all of his albums and ripped them before he left). And it was surprising to see how helpful this sub was with that as well. I'm not going to mention specific threads or sites that I used, but it's quite easy to search and you'll find them. And now that I'm done, 180+ albums / 107 GB's later (all 320, no FLAC for space and compatibility reasons), I just wanted to say thank you all for building this sub and making it so that someone like me can discover what makes a band great in the eyes of their fans without being all super weird and obsessed like other subs are. Keep doing what you're doing because I'm sure there are lurkers like me who appreciate this sub but never actually say it.

Sorry this was so song, but thank you again to everyone here!",gratefuldead,1539615988,DevStark,35,1,True,2018-10-15

Archive.org help!,"I’ve been listening to a lot of live dead on archive.org on my phone, especially the “Today of the Dead” and a lot of your comments talking about your favorite shows. However the problem is it doesn’t automatically go from song to song. At the end of the song the music stops, I have to take my phone out, re enter my password, get back to archive.org and hit play again for the next song to start. There’s nothing worse than being in the middle of a tasty transition and have the music stop and have to go through all that, every time for every song! Pain in the ass. Any recommendations? It’s just so convenient that I can come here and find archive.org links to so many great shows but the music stopping after each track is killing me.

The Electric Cool Aid Acid Test.,"So, about 1980, I read the book, I was a teenager.  Since then, I got on the bus (1981) and saw the dead about 80 times, and all the incarnations since then.

I don't need to explain why I love those '60s and early-mid '70s shows but I feel those ""peak"" years lack the energy of prior and latter concerts. They just sound very mellow and laid back. Case in point 6/9/76 Saint Stephen though I give them credit for evolving and changing their style. By '78 it appears they got their high energy groove back and carried that on into the early '80s. Plus for me it marks the time that one of my least favorite Dead song (Looks Like Rain) got consistent concert play.

Woodstock 2019 update?,"Has anyone heard anything new about the supposed ""large-scale"" music festival celebrating 50 years after Woodstock?  There were several articles about it in 2017 but I haven't heard much about it since.

Even if they abandoned the idea, I'd like to know.  Personally, despite big fat ticket prices and commercialization inevitable with all large scale music fests of the 21st century, I still thought it would be a cool idea.  Would be sweet if they filled it with a psychedelic/Americana/rock lineup like the OG event.  A bonus if Dead and Co were to redeem the Dead's less than stellar show there haha.

Music and the Mind: The Concert—featuring Mickey Hart, Zakir Hussain, Jason Moran, Renée Fleming, and More (part of Sound Health)

## Friday, September 7, 2018 8:00 PM

Fresh from last year’s sold-out event, today’s most innovative artists join top neuroscientists for our groundbreaking concert experience exploring links between music, rhythm, and brain development.

&amp;#x200B;

***Music has been fundamental to every human civilization. Why do we have music—and what makes it so powerful? What does current research tell us about the role that music can play in human development and learning?***  


Fresh from last year’s SOLD-OUT *Music and the Mind* concert, more of today’s most innovative artists join top neuroscientists for our groundbreaking concert experience exploring fascinating links between music, rhythm, and brain development as revealed by the latest research!

Thank you all for a wonderful life. Of course there has been some bad times but when it’s good, it’s really good. And having the dead on your back, just shows how beautiful life can be. I love you all. And I want you to be happy.",gratefuldead,1536366593,crazyfingers123,5,29,True,2018-09-07

Pacific Northwest Listening Notes - Listen to the Shows in the Archive If Your Don't Have 'Em,"To be honest, the thing that excites me most about this release is just that it calls attention to a series of shows that should be well known by everyone, first to last notes. For years I have thought of the summer Northwest run of 73, these three shows, as Peak Dead (yeah yeah, one of many). So if you're not shelling out $$$ for the official release, just listen to the incredibly good boards available on the archive. No one is left out. There are amazing moments throughout and I hope people track theirs in this thread. For me:

&amp;#x200B;

\- **6-22-73 Deal** shines a spotlight on just how great Bobby sounded back then, playing in response to Jerry. You can hear it in any recording, but the release does make it sublime -- that Deal is this gorgeous interplay between Jerry and Bobby (Bob sounds especially good) and then Keith, too.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **6-22-73 Bird Song** one of the finest from this period. Nuff said.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **6-22-73 Truckin --&gt; Other One** in the release (and you can hear this on spotify with the best of disc), listen in the last 5 mins or so of Truckin, after the Phil bombz, to how the band complete dissembles and then reconstructs the sound. There is a brief moment when they all suddenly kick in and play a jazzy riff together, Bob sending us news from the dust clouds on another planet as he plays ... that is to my ears one of the finest moments of playing by the group ever. Start listening how it comes together starting around 20 mins into Truckin, but the moment I mean really kicks in at **23:10**

&amp;#x200B;

**6-24-74 Dark Star** six minutes in the pick up a theme that arrives often in 73 jamming, spring, summer, and fall and is interesting to compare to the jam I reference above from the night before, between Truckin and Other One. The previous night is, I think, the same jam but played inside out. Like they were on their way to a familiar theme that they'd tried out a  few times (and would again) but on 6.22 it just kind of imploded and became what it did. Anyway. Listen to this Dark Star it is one for the absolute ages.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on, but what are your must-listen moments in these six shows?

Help Needed!: Song ID in Bob Weir Netflix Doc,"Hey all thanks for your time.

 I have been trying to track down this recording of the song played in the Netflix doc: The Other One: The Long Strange Trip of Bob Weir.

The song begins at exactly 1:05:09 when they start talking about Hawaii vacation.  It sounds like a section of sugar magnolia with rhythm on acoustic and lead on electric with some reverb...  It sounds amazing.  I was just wondering if anybody knows what recording this is? Is it from a specific show?  Studio?  Whatever it is I feel the need to track it down.

Comments from deadlists:  SBD 180, AUD 180. Timings from AUD. Very quick tape flips (about three seconds each) In Eyes of the World And Around And Around. The SBD does not have A complete U.S. Blues. A 90 minute black &amp; white video of the first set through part of Loser And from the second set: Truckin', Wharf Rat, And part of Around And Around circulates. The show was filmed by the university with three cameras (two between the front row And the stage, And one at the soundboard). The circulating segment is an edit from the three camera shots. There is no trace of the remaining portion of the show nor each of the three original reels. The films have reportedly long since disappeared from the Duke University archives. The video quality is A little rough but historic nonetheless as It is A rare document that has Garcia windmilling A la Pete Townsend.

Here's the aformentioned video!

Grateful Dead's Dark Star - Phases 1-15 - September 2017 to September 2018 - Zythum Studios,"Greetings fellow travelers! This is my first post here. I have been led here from Grateful Dead information that I research and always come up on Reddit :)

&amp;#x200B;

I turned 53 this year - August 4, 1965. I am a composer and musician and run a private studio for the past 30+ year - Zythum Studios. Since July of 1995 , I have never played or recorded with other musicans again.  I will be honest with you. I was never a Dead Head or Grateful Dead fan. I came from hard rock and was not turned on by all the cover groups that played only Dead music with really bad vocals. Anyway, in 1995 when Jerry passed away , I was very sad to hear the news and went out and 6 cented some Grateful Dead CDs. I purchsed 100 year old Hall , Live Dead , One and Two from the vault and Anthem of the Sun. I was blown away with Jerry more than the others (as a guitar player , he dained my respect instantly.) 

My first introduction to the Dead's magic and Jerry's playing on par with Frank Zappa , was , of course , Dark Star from live Dead. My jaw was on the floor , hearing the vibe and tone of Jerry's lead guitar playing just bursting forth with beauty and conviction , like I had never heard. ""Jerry is as good as Zappa"" , I excalimed. LOL , that was a big deal to me , as Zappa was the beat guitarist on the face of the Earth back in those days.

Years have passed since that Grateful Dead introduction. I have many more albums , but I never got into them as much as other artists. That is until the summer of 2017. That is when it all began for me all over in a way that is still affecting me now. The journey in music , the pure honest journey is truly what it is all about. No second takes , no apologies and no tricks. Modern music recording has a way of sounding overproduced and edited. I was listening to GREYFOLDEAD with the mixed Dark Stars and got very inspired to record something like what I was hearing. A wonderful mesh of instruments all falling in and out of textures , themes and transitions. I was so inspired , that I relaized my approch to music would have to evolve.

&amp;#x200B;

In September of 2017 I was searching now for Dark Stars on Youtube. My first find was a recent concert with Bob Weir , Phil Lesh and Holly Bowling , from about a week earlier. Bob was playing an old Martin 00-17 acoustic and I have a 1947 version of the same guitar. I listened to that performance and it triggared my first recording of Dark Star on September 18, 2017 , which is the only one I did that has an acoustic guitar on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started to download so much Grateful Dead Dark Stars (as well as full concerts) , that it took up much of my days for months. I ended up with over 100 gig of Dead music. I got as many Dark Stars as I could and organized them by date and years. I became quite a student of the composition , first only consitrating on the development of the song in 1968. My favotite period of the Grateful Dead is 1968-1974. I feel the magic was in those years. Also , I love fusion snd they were it!

&amp;#x200B;

Ok. Why am I saying all of this and who cares?

&amp;#x200B;

Well , I wanted to share my musical adventure of Dark Star with you all. Who, but Grateful Dead fans could enjoy the fruits of DS moments as much as you all?

&amp;#x200B;

It was not so easy getting rid of a distorted guitar tone. I have a similar tone to Frank Zappa by defualt and ""comming clean"" was no easy task. For those that do not play ""clean"" , Jerry's tones are a bit difficult to create. The first 3 DS I do are a testament to this fact. DS - Phase 4 sounds more like I am getting a grip on the situation.

So here are my Dark Stars. So far, Phases 1-15.

&amp;#x200B;

If you listen to them on YT , please like , subscibe and comment. Any response is welcome :)

What are your underrated songs (covers included),"Mine:

Doin' That Rag. They retired it after less than a year even though unlike some of the other psychedelic songs they stopped playing, it  fits the Americana period. Hardly ever hear people talk about it or put it on the D&amp;C wish list. [2/28/69](https://archive.org/details/gd69-02-28.sbd.16track.kaplan.3397.sbeok.shnf/gd69-02-28d1t04.shn)

Little Sadie. I absolutely love how they do this song but recordings of most versions not great. [Here's](https://archive.org/details/gd70-02-28.sbd.cotsman.9377.sbeok.shnf/gd70-02-28d1t06.shn#) the best recording imo. And a really [fun video](https://archive.org/details/gd70-02-28.sbd.cotsman.9377.sbeok.shnf/gd70-02-28d1t06.shn#) from RCMH (not great audio tho). And for a bonus: [Garcia and Kahn video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vGVLTwILAs)

It's All Over Now, Baby Blue. I think this is there best Dylan. Great versions from so many eras even though they didn't play it much.

Big River = Working Man Blues?,"Hi, 

Recent Deadhead rookie, fell in love with the band within the last year still working through the huge catalogue of music. But, I'm a guitarist and when I first heard the Dead version of ""Big River"" this summer on the D&amp;C tour I knew I knew the lick from somewhere else. I sat in with a country artist about a month ago who requested that I know the main lick for ""Working Man Blues"". So as I got it under my fingers during our session I knew I knew the lick from somewhere else but couldn't put my finger on it. Until, it clicked that the Dead used it for ""Big River"" despite Johnny's version having it's own distinct riff. 

I've tried googling and researching, but does anyone know why they decided to mesh Merle with Johnny on their version of ""Big River""? I like the ""Working man blues"" riff better and I like the lyrics and melody of ""Big River"" better so for me and my group we've decided to just play ""Big River"" the Dead way as I feel as a combo it's better than either one individually from a music aspect. But, still, I'm curious if anyone knows anything else about it. It's not the most common substitution to take a very recognizable riff from another song and put it on a song with another very recognizable riff.

Then 1972 it seems that the Dead are dosed most of the time (the most evident on film , is Sunshine Daydream concert - August 27, 1972.

Book Review: Fare Thee Well,"So I finally got the Selvin book from my library and and got through it over the weekend.  I have returned the book because there was a number of holds so I don't have exact quotes or pin sites.  If you want to call me out because I don't have a page number, IDGAF.  These are my general thoughts YMMV.

I lived in San Francisco and read Selvin when he wrote for the Chronicle.  I thought his reviews were interesting, but had an edge like he was trying to defend rock n roll as his image of what it should be.  I don't recall any of his reviews of Dead related bands at the time so I can't say if he has had a change of mind.  A lot of his reviews of Grateful Dead shows are available online and while he has a familiarity with the band and material, I don't think the reviews are particularly insightful.  
I do think that he has a certain entitlement, shared with many other rock critics of his generation.  In this podcast he claims that there has been no good music made after 1984.

http://www.rocknrollarchaeology.com/deeper-digs-in-rock/2018/7/30/c4mqh45yl67y8sqtgolbhbwmli6zh8

This is obviously hyperbole as I read his positive reviews of music post 1984, but it is a pretty poor attitude for someone who was paid to write objectively about music for decades after 1984.  It was an opinion that lots of Baby Boomer rock critics held and still do hold.  

On to the book. 
First of all I don't think he made anything up.  The book seems well researched and he is a real journalist who would not make stuff up.  I'm sure he has a source or two for each factual assertion that he makes.  

That doesn't mean that there aren't mistakes.  There are small ones such as how often a song was played or the last time it was played.  They are not that consequential to the whole of the book, but are readily verifiable in the age of internet databases.  There are also inconsistencies within the book.  Early in the book he discusses the Phil and Phriends 1999 shows.  Then, when he is discussing the FTW rehearsals he claims that Trey had never played more than 10 minutes on stage with members of the Dead.  Just flat wrong and contradicted by his same book.   His assertion later in the book was to criticize Phil's limit on practice, but it was just not true.  

The main objective of the book seems to be to make Phil and Jill Lesh out to be money grubbing monsters.  That is clear and any claim different by Selvin is bullshit.  The only people whose motives he questions are the Leshes.  I don't disagree that Phil and Jill took control and rubbed people the wrong way, but the author always casts it with a sinister motive.  Never does he even consider that the numerous business failures of the Grateful Dead were because the band lacked leadership and Lesh intended to remedy that.  

Then there are the malicious personal shots at Phil.  His looks, his singing, etc...  These do nothing to advance any theme or overarching point in the book.  These pop up so often I think the subtitle of the book should be ""I think Phil sings like shit"".  If he pointed out the personal failings of the other band members as much as he did Phil it would be 3 volumes.  He barely touches on Bobby's ""personal issues"" or the fact that Mickey is virtually deaf and hasn't been able to keep time in 30 years.  No mention at all of Bobby's atrocious slide guitar playing (which hasn't gotten better since the early 80's) but constant cheap shots at Phil.
He also fails to acknowledge that Phil had the power to impose his will because he was the soul of the Grateful Dead.  The reason surviving bands found success was because Phil was on bass.    Since Selvin isn't a deadhead he may not have known this going into the story, but his research should have made it abundantly clear.  

Another thing I noticed in the book was a lack of quotes.  Generally a book like this has lots and lots of quotes from the subjects, especially since they are alive.  It gives the book life and makes the stories believable.  By failing to get interviews, the book reads like a lot of second hand and third hand stories.  

While the book has a lot of sources in his bibliography, it is organized in a confusing way, possibly purposely. The text of the book rarely explains what source he is using to tell the specific story.  Instead he relies on a bibliography at the end of the book.  However it is impossible to tell what source he relied on for each part of the book.  Instead of organizing sources by chapter, they are simply listed in alphabetic order at the end of the book.  Meaning you would have to read almost every source to determine what one the author relied on in each chapter.  I would argue that this is intentional because his sourcing relies on second and third hand reports and his specific slant on the story.  

Anyway, that is just my two cents and poorly organized thoughts.  I'm not really looking for responses, but go at it if you want.",gratefuldead,1537333246,Slpry_Pete,21,12,True,2018-09-19

Vintage Parking Lot T-Shirts,"So as I have gotten older, I wanted to go back and take a look at some of the t-shirts I have collected over the years and perhaps try to restore them to their former glory.

Unfortunately, my very favorite shirt that I owned, I gave away which I may never see again. It was a hand drawn shirt of a huge marijuana tree, very intricate, sitting a top a skull at the bottom and on the back it had the molecular formula of THC and said Tetrahydrocannabinol. IF you have this or have an image of it, please let me know!

Rambling and backpedaling from a D&amp;C critic,"I'm a second generation deadhead; parents were casual fans, some aunts and uncles toured heavily through the '70s, and from birth the band has provided the soundtrack to my life.


I didn't start going to Dead related shows until (roughly) 2002, and despite having been involved with Phish and other various ""jam bands"", I was totally blown away by the Dead scene's warmth and eclecticism.


There is something unique to Grateful Dead music and the surrounding community that I've had a hell of a time trying to articulate, but it's like the convergence of yin and yang - dark and light - and as the music chugs along, the band and audience work together toward fleeting moments of magical absurdity when beauty and love unify with grime and fear and all parties involved can catch a glimpse of our true nature through the music. As far as rock and roll bands go, nobody was as good as the Dead at patiently building tension as a unit, toying with release, and then finally resolving the tension (or not) to the ecstatic delight of the listener. It's those moments - in addition to triumphant transitions, boundless improvisation, etc. - that invoke epiphanies for both the audience as well as the performers.


There was a reddit post months ago that I can't find now, in which somebody pretty eloquently described the quality of many Grateful Dead songs to seem as though ""we join the song already in progress"" - the song was never written, nor was the song ever begun or finished. It has always existed, and the band serves as a conduit, pulling the tune out of the air and presenting it to the crowd.


It's safe to say that Garcia is on the short list of performers who could control an audience with nothing more than a subtle facial expression, musical virtuosity aside. Like nearly every facet of the band, their music, and the surrounding community, his paradoxical personality fits in to the yin/yang concept previously mentioned. As far as Hunter's lyrics go, what can one say?


In my opinion, music stands a head above other art forms in terms of its ability to hint at answers to the imponderable questions we struggle to answer over the course of our lives. When I first started going to shows I had the common experience of feeling like *everybody except me* was in on a huge joke. This was so powerful that I would sometimes be on the verge of a panic attack, feeling totally isolated as the crowd around me was boogying and sharing a special moment. It felt like the universe was fucking with me. I kept going to shows, eventually finding my groove, and settled with the understanding that we're all having this experience together, and the best way to approach the awkward existential dilemma of feeling like the butt of a cosmic joke is to contribute to the community in a positive way - be it through singing, dancing, helping, vending... Anything other than being an asshole, really, is a contribution.


I have no idea where I'm going with this. I'm sort of beating around the bush as to not sound like an off-the-rails acid casualty, but it seems obvious to me that the Grateful Dead were divinely influenced, or helped along by some unseen force. There I said it.


I tend to be hyper-critical of bands continuing the tradition of performing these sacred songs (as if my opinions and criticisms have any influence) and I see now that in doing so I've come across as a mope and I'm likely limiting my own enjoyment of certain concerts by having a ""standard"". I'm speaking specifically about Dead &amp; Co. who I have consistently shit on since the beginning.


In my defense, I'm certainly not alone here, and my criticisms are shared by maybe half of the people I speak with. This divide among fans has of course happened a few times in Dead history; when a portion of (maybe jaded) fans have become disillusioned with the direction of the band in regards to the music or business or community aspects. It comes from good intentions: fans of old fear progress that may move away from the noble values the scene was built upon. I think considering the condition of our culture that fear is justified.


Hyperbole and personal feelings aside, the objective facts are: the ""core four"" are still touring after more than *50 fucking years* since the Grateful Dead was born, and we should be rejoicing even if they just went up on stage and laid an egg every night (which they don't). They chose a guitarist who has done a beyond respectable job of learning the catalog and adapting to the music that was originally out of his wheelhouse in terms of style. Perhaps in part to having selected Mayer, we have a new generation of fans digging the music, and the Grateful Dead *brand* is bigger than ever.


I've never seen so many Stealies, Berthas, and dancing bears out in public as I have the past two summers. It seems like every small town I visit has a GD ""tribute band"" and more so than at any other concerts I've attended, Dead-related shows have ever-increasing diversity in the audience; 13 year olds and 80 year olds all getting down together.


So... The music plays on as long as capable performers can pull the tunes from out of the air, and we have an obligation to help facilitate the magic I mentioned earlier. The number of people these songs and shows have touched on a deeply emotional and spiritual level must number in the millions at this point.


The last thought I want to put down is that even though the Grateful Dead is a decades-old American tradition with a large catalog of timeless songs, and even though popularity is high and there is no sign of slowing, to quote the motto of the Merry Pranksters: *nothing lasts.*


Fortunately, there will be more bands that have a similar impact on society and help to shape the generation(s) they spring from.

Brokedown Palace and Siddhartha,"Hi everyone, I read Hermann Hesse's *Siddhartha* earlier and I ended up finding what seem like a bunch of parallels between the book and Brokedown Palace, and I thought you'd find it interesting. Forgive the long post, but I think it's a little uncanny.

Fare you well, my honey

Fare you well, my only true one

All the birds that were singing

are flown, except you alone

Gonna leave this brokedown palace (1),

on my hands and my knees (1), I will roll, roll, roll

Make myself a bed, by the waterside (2)

in my time, in my time, I will roll, roll, roll

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head

Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul (3)

River's gonna take me, sing me sweet and sleepy (4)

sing me sweet and sleepy, all the way back home (4)

It's a far gone lullaby, sung many years ago (4)

Mama, mama, many worlds I've come since I first left home

Going home, going home, by the waterside I will rest my bones (5)

Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul (3)

Gonna plant this weeping willow

on the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow

Sing a lullaby, beside the water

Lovers come and go, the river, roll, roll, roll (6)

Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell (7)

Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul (3)

1: Siddhartha leaving his family's palace, to live as an ascetic, who figuratively lives on his hands and his knees begging

2: Initially staying with the ferryman

3: The song of the river, Om

4: Siddhartha falling asleep by the river after nearly committing suicide. The river ""puts him to sleep""

5: Going back to the ferryman by the River, this time much older

6: Kamala comes back, but then leaves

7: His son leaving, and Siddhartha's accepting it out of love",gratefuldead,1533499133,Anumaen,4,20,True,2018-08-05

Avenues of finding new Grateful Dead music?,"Hi all,

I’m a younger fan at 20. I’ve been listening to the dead for several years but just got into them heavy when I was given 600 Gb of archive.com shows. It’s overwhelming just having all these dates and venue names. I find more new GD music through headyversion and comments on Reddit and sometimes on archive. BUT my question to you friends is this, how do you like to find new Dead shows to listen to? I’ve thought about trying to collect some of the dicks picks albums since they’re obviously well thought of, only thing is I have no money. Also if you guys wanna drop any shows you all like I’d appreciate. I listened to 69-72 stuff a good amount as well as 77 and around there.

"Most aggressive/fierce/fiery ""Loser"" solo of all time?","I've heard Jer worked for many years to perfect the main solo in ""Loser""—his insistence on refining and perfecting it down to the last note makes it something of an anomaly. It's also always been one of my all-time favorite songs. The irony of its closing lyrical refrain, with all its supposed certainty, (""Well I've got no chance of losing, this time"")  is a great example of the subversive wit and insight into the human condition that animates so much of the Dead's best work. Plus, it's just a killer tune. But it's that solo that's always killed me. Like you, I've listened to hundreds of recordings and was even fortunate enough to have seen a few dozen live performances of ""Loser.""

Today of the Dead: An Elegy for Jerry by Robert Hunter,"    An Elegy for Jerry by Robert Hunter
    
    Jerry, my friend,
    you’ve done it again,
    even in your silence
    the familiar pressure
    comes to bear, demanding
    I pull words from the air
    with only this morning
    and part of the afternoon
    to compose an ode worthy
    of one so particular
    about every turn of phrase,
    demanding it hit home
    in a thousand ways
    before making it his own,
    and this I can’t do alone.
    Now that the singer is gone,
    where shall I go for the song?
    
    Without your melody and taste
    to lend an attitude of grace
    a lyric is an orphan thing,
    a hive with neither honey’s taste
    nor power to truly sting.
    
    What choice have I but to dare and
    call your muse who thought to rest
    out of the thin blue air
    that out of the field of shared time,
    a line or two might chance to shine —
    
    As ever when we called,
    in hope if not in words,
    the muse descends.
    
    How should she desert us now?
    Scars of battle on her brow,
    bedraggled feathers on her wings,
    and yet she sings, she sings!
    
    May she bear thee to thy rest,
    the ancient bower of flowers
    beyond the solitude of days,
    the tyranny of hours–
    the wreath of shining laurel lie
    upon your shaggy head
    bestowing power to play the lyre
    to legions of the dead
    
    If some part of that music
    is heard in deepest dream,
    or on some breeze of Summer
    a snatch of golden theme,
    we’ll know you live inside us
    with love that never parts
    our good old Jack O’Diamonds
    become the King of Hearts.
    
    I feel your silent laughter
    at sentiments so bold
    that dare to step across the line
    to tell what must be told,
    so I’ll just say I love you,
    which I never said before
    and let it go at that old friend
    the rest you may ignore.",gratefuldead,1533716997,MrDanger,7,46,True,2018-08-08

"One Year After Jerry's Death, Robert Hunter Wrote Him A Beautiful Letter","Dear JG,

it’s been a year since you shuffled off the mortal coil and a lot has happened. It might surprise you to know you made every front page in the world. The press is still having fun, mostly over lawsuits challenging your somewhat …umm… patchwork Last Will and Testament. Annabelle didn’t get the EC horror comic collection, which I think would piss you off as much as anything. Nor could Doug Irwin accept the legacy of the guitars he built for you because the tax-assessment on them, icon-enriched as they are, is more than he can afford short of selling them off. The upside of the craziness is: your image is selling briskly enough that your estate should manage something to keep various wolves from various familial doors, even after the lawyers are paid. How it’s to be divided will probably fall in the hands of the judge. An expert on celebrity wills said in the news that yours was a blueprint on how not to make a will.

The band decided to call it quits. I think it’s a move that had to be made. You weren’t exactly a sideman. But nothing’s for certain. Some need at least the pretense of retirement after all these years. Can they sustain it? We’ll see.

I’m writing this from England, by the way. Much clarity of perspective to be had from stepping out of the scene for a couple of months. What isn’t so clear is my own role, but it’s really no more problematic than it has been for the last decade. As long as I get words on paper and can lead myself to believe it’s not bullshit, I’m roughly content. I’m not exactly Mr. Business.

I decided to get a personal archive together to stick on that stagnating computer site we had. Really started pouring the mustard on. I’m writing, for crying out loud, my diary on it! Besides running my ego full tilt (what’s new?) I’m trying to give folks some skinny on what’s going down. I don’t mean I’m busting the usual suspects left and right, but am giving a somewhat less than cautious overview and soapboxing more than a little. They appointed me webmaster, and I hope they don’t regret it.

There are those in the entourage who quietly believe we’re washed up without you. Even should time and circumstance prove it to be so, we need to believe otherwise long enough to get some self sustaining operations going, or we’ll never know for sure. It’s matter of self respect. Maybe it’s a long shot, but this whole fucking trip was a longshot from the start, so what else is new?

Your funeral service was one hell of a scene. Maureen and I took Barbara and Sara in and sat with them. MG  [ Mountain Girl ] waited over at our place. Manasha and Keelan were also absent. None by choice. Everybody from the band said some words and Steve, especially, did you proud, speaking with great love and candor. Annabelle got up and said you were a genius, a great guy, a wonderful friend, and a shitty father – which shocked part of the contingent and amused the rest. After awhile the minister said that that was enough talking, but I called out, from the back of the church, “Wait, I’ve got something!” and charged up the aisle and read this piece I wrote for you, my voice and hands shaking like a leaf. Man, it was weird looking over and seeing you dead!

A slew of books have come out about you and more to follow. Perspective is lacking. It’s way too soon. You’d be amazed at the number of people with whom you’ve had a nodding acquaintance who are suddenly experts on your psychology and motivations. Your music still speaks louder than all the BS: who you were, not the messes you got yourself into. Only a very great star is afforded that much inspection and that much forgiveness.

There was so much confusion on who should be allowed to attend the scattering of your ashes that they sat around for four months. It was way too weird for this cowboy who was neither invited nor desirous of going. I said good-bye with my poem [ “Eulogy for Jerry”  ] at the funeral service. It was cathartic and I didn’t need an anti-climax.

A surreal sidelight: Weir went to India and scattered a handful of your ashes in the Ganges as a token of your worldwide stature. He took a lot of flak from the fans for it, which must have hurt. A bunch of them decided to scapegoat him, presumably needing someplace to misdirect their anger over the loss of you. In retrospect, I think Weir was hardest hit of the old crowd by your death. I take these things in my stride, though I admit to a rough patch here and there. But Bob took it right on the chin. Shock was written all over his face for a long time, for any with eyes to see.

Some of the guys have got bands together and are doing a tour. The fans complain it’s not the same without you, and of course it isn’t, but a reasonable number show up and have a pretty good time. The insane crush of the latter day GD shows is gone and that’s all for the best. From the show I saw, and reports on the rest, the crowd is discovering that the sense of community is still present, matured through mutual grief over losing you. This will evolve in more joyous directions over time, but no one’s looking to fill your shoes. No one has the presumption.

Been remembering some of the key talks we had in the old days, trying to suss what kind of a tiger we were riding, where it was going, and how to direct it, if possible. Driving to the city once, you admitted you didn’t have a clue what to do beyond composing and playing the best you could. I agreed – put the weight on the music, stay out of politics, and everything else should follow. I trusted your musical sense and you were good enough to trust my words. Trust was the whole enchilada, looking back.

Walking down Madrone Canyon in Larkspur in 1969, you said some pretty mindblowing stuff, how we were creating a universe and I was responsible for the verbal half of it. I said maybe, but it was your way with music and a guitar that was pulling it off. You said “That’s for now. This is your time in the shadow, but it won’t always be that way. I’m not going to live a long time, it’s not in the cards. Then it’ll be your turn.” I may be alive and kicking, but no pencil pusher is going to inherit the stratosphere that so gladly opened to you. Recalling your statement, though, often helped keep me oriented as my own star murked below the horizon while you streaked across the sky of our generation like a goddamned comet!

Though my will to achieve great things is moderated by seeing what comes of them, I’ve assigned myself the task of trying to honor the original vision. I’m not answerable to anybody but my conscience, which, if less than spotless, doesn’t keep me awake at night. Maybe it’s best, personally speaking, that the power to make contracts and deal the remains of what was built through the decades rests in other hands. I wave the flag and rock the boat from time to time, since I believe much depends on it, but will accept the outcome with equanimity.

Just thought it should be said that I no longer hold your years of self inflicted decline against you. I did for awhile, felt ripped off, but have come to understand that you were troubled and compromised by your position in the public eye far beyond anyone’s powers to deal with. Star shit. Who can you really trust? Is it you or your image they love? No one can understand those dilemmas in depth except those who have no choice but to live them. You whistled up the whirlwind and it blew you away. Your substance of choice made you more malleable to forces you would have brushed off with a characteristic sneer in earlier days. Well, you know it to be so. Let those who pick your bones note that it was not always so.

So here I am, writing a letter to a dead man, because it’s hard to find a context to say things like this other than to imagine I have your ear, which of course I don’t. Only to say that what you were is more startlingly apparent in your absence than ever it was in the last decade. I remember sitting in the waiting room of the hospital through the days of your first coma. Not being related, I wasn’t allowed into the intensive care unit to see you until you came to and requested to see me. And there you were – more open and vulnerable than I’d ever seen you. You grasped my hand and began telling me your visions, the crazy densely packed phantasmagoria way beyond any acid trip, the demons and mechanical monsters that taunted and derided, telling you endless bad jokes and making horrible puns of everything – and then you asked, point blank, “Have I gone insane?” I said “No, you’ve been very sick. You’ve been in a coma for days, right at death’s door. They’re only hallucinations, they’ll go away. You survived.” “Thanks,” you said. “I needed to hear that.”

Your biographers aren’t pleased that I don’t talk to them, but how am I to say stuff like this to an interviewer with an agenda? I sometimes report things that occur to me about you in my journal, as the moment releases it, in my own way, in my own time, and they can take what they want of that.

Obviously, faith in the underlying vision which spawned the Grateful Dead might be hard to muster for those who weren’t part of the all night rap sessions circa 1960-61 … sessions that picked up the next morning at Kepler’s bookstore then headed over to the Stanford cellar or St. Mike’s to continue over coffee and guitars. There were no hippies in those days and the beats had bellied up. There was only us vs. 50’s consciousness. There no jobs to be had if we wanted them. Just folk music and tremendous dreams. Yeah, we dreamed our way here. I trust it. So did you. Not so long ago we wrote a song about all that, and you sang it like a prayer. The Days Between. Last song we ever wrote.

Context is lost, even now. The sixties were a long time ago and getting longer. A cartoon version of our times satisfies public perception. Our continuity is misunderstood as some sort of strange persistence of an outmoded style. Beads, bell bottoms and peace signs. But no amount of pop cynicism can erase the suspicion, in the minds of the present generation, that something was going on once that was better than what’s going on now. And I sense that they’re digging for “what it is” and only need the proper catalyst to find it for themselves. Your guitar is like a compass needle pointing the strange way there. I’m wandering far afield from the intention of this letter, a year’s report, but this year wasn’t made up only of events following your death in some roughly chronological manner. It reached down to the roots of everything, shook the earth off, and inspected them. The only constant is the fact that you remain silent. Various dances are done around that fact.

Don’t misconstrue me, I don’t waste much time in grief. Insofar as you were able, you were an exponent of a dream in the continual act of being defined into a reality. You had a massive personality and talent to present it to the world. That dream is the crux of the matter, and somehow concerns beauty, consciousness and community. We were, and are, worthy insofar as we serve it. When that dream is dead, there’ll be time enough for true and endless grief.

John Kahn died in May, same day Leary did. Linda called 911 and they came over and searched the house, found a tiny bit of coke and carted her off to jail in shock. If the devil himself isn’t active in this world, there’s sure something every bit as mean: institutional righteousness without an iota of fellow feeling. But, as I figure, that’s the very reason the dream is so important – it’s whatever is the diametric opposite of that. Human kindness.

Trust me that I don’t walk around saying “this was what Jerry would have wanted” to drive my points home. What you wanted is a secret known but to yourself. You said ‘yes’ to what sounded like a good idea at the time, ‘no’ to what sounded like a bad one. I see more of what leadership is about, in the absence of it. It’s an instinct for good ideas. An aversion to bad ones. Compromise on indifferent ones. Power is another matter. Power is not leadership but coercion. People follow leaders because they want to.

I know you were often sick and tired of the conflicting demands made on you by contentious forces you invited into your life and couldn’t as easily dismiss. You once said to me, in 1960, “just say yes to everybody and do what you damn well want.” Maybe, but when every ‘yes’ becomes an IOU payable in full, who’s coffer is big enough to pay up? “Fuck ’em if they can’t take a joke!” would be a characteristic reply. Unfortunately, you’re not around to explain what was a joke and what wasn’t. It all boils down to signed pieces of paper with no punch lines appended.

I know what I’m saying in this letter can be taken a hundred ways. As always, I just say what occurs to me to say and can’t say what doesn’t. Could I write a book about you? No. Didn’t know you well enough. Let those who knew you even less write them. You were canny enough to keep your own self to yourself and let your fingers do the talking. Speaking of ‘personal matters’ was never your shtick.

Our friendship was testy. I challenged you rather more than you liked, having a caustic tongue. In later years you preferred the company of those capable of keeping it light and non-judgmental. I think it must always be that way with prominent and powerfully gifted persons. I don’t say that, for the most part, your inner circle weren’t good and true. They’d have laid down their lives for you. I’d have had to think about it. I mean, a star is a star is a star. There’s no reality check. If the truth were known, you were too well loved for your own good, but that smacks of psychologizing and I drop the subject forthwith

All our songs are acquiring new meanings. I don’t deny writing with an eye to the future at times, but our mutual folk, blues and country background gave us a mutual liking for songs that dealt with sorrow and the dark issues of life. Neither of us gave a fuck for candy coated shit, psychedelic or otherwise. I never even thought of us as a “pop band.” You had to say to me one day, after I’d handed over the Eagle Mall suite, “Look, Hunter – we’re a goddamn dance band, for Christ’s sake! At least write something with a beat!” Okay. I handed over Truckin’ next. How was I to know? I thought we were silver and gold; something new on this Earth. But the next time I tried to slip you the heavy stuff, you actually went for it. Seems like you’d had the vision of the music about the same time I had the vision of the words, independently. Terrapin. Shame about the record, but the concert piece, the first night it was played, took me about as close as I ever expect to get to feeling certain we were doing what we were put here to do. One of my few regrets is that you never wanted to finish it, though you approved of the final version I eked out many years later. You said, apologetically, “I love it, but I’ll never get the time to do it justice.” I realized that was true. Time was the one thing you never had in the last decade and a half. Supporting the Grateful Dead plus your own trip took all there was of that. The rest was crashing time. Besides, as you once said, “I’d rather toss cards in a hat than compose.” But man, when you finally got down on it, you sure knew how.

The pressure of making regular records was a creative spur for a long time, but poor sales put the economic weight on live concerts where new material wasn’t really required, so my role in the group waned. A difficult time for me, being at my absolute peak and all. I had to go on the road myself to make a living. It was good for me. I developed a sense of self direction that didn’t depend on the Dead at all. This served well for the songs we were still to write together. You sure weren’t interested in flooding the market. You knew one decent song was worth a dozen cobbled together pieces of shit, saved only by arrangement. I guess we have a few of those too, but the percentage is respect ably low. Pop songs come and go, blossom and wither, but we scored a piece of Americana, my friend. Sooner or later, they’ll notice what we did doesn’t die the way we do. I’ve always believed that and so did you. Once in awhile we’d even call each other “Mister” and exchange congratulations. Other people are starting to record those songs now, and they stand on their own.

For some reason it seems worthwhile to maintain the Grateful Dead structures: Rex, the website, GDP, the deadhead office, the studio … even with the band out of commission. I don’t know if this is some sort of denial that the game is finished, or if the intuitive impulse is a sound one. I feel it’s better to have it than not, just in case, because once it’s gone there’s no bringing it back. The forces will disperse and settle elsewhere. A business that can’t support itself is, of course, no business at all, just a locus of dissension, so the reality factor will rule. Diminished as we are without you, there is still some of the quick, bright spirit around. I mean, you wouldn’t have thrown in your lot with a bunch of belly floppers, would you?

Let me see – is there anything I’ve missed? Plenty, but this seems like a pretty fat report. You’ve been gone a year now and the boat is still afloat. Can we make it another year? What forms will it assume? It’s all kind of exciting. They say a thousand years are only a twinkle in God’s eye. Is that so?

Missing you in a longtime way.

Is it legal for Ticketmaster - the platform selling tickets - to buy all the tickets at face value and resell them *on the same platform* at 100%-500%+ markup?

Within 8 minutes (the amount of time it took for me to secure my Santa Barbara tickets) I checked Ticketmaster to see the seating chart and there are hundreds of tickets for resale... on the original seller’s platform. Minimum markup 100%. Most tickets 4-5x face value.

And in digging deep into their albums and live performances I've come to realize just how great they are. I've been listening to their music every day for a couple weeks now. Althea might be the best song I've ever heard.

I'm so damn mad at myself for never taking the time to really appreciate their music while my father was still alive and share the love for their music with him.

"An Elegy for Jerry, by Robert Hunter, August 9, 1995","An Elegy for Jerry

by Robert Hunter

August 9, 1995

 

Jerry, my friend,

you've done it again,

even in your silence

the familiar pressure

comes to bear, demanding

I pull words from the air

with only this morning

and part of the afternoon

to compose an ode worthy

of one so particular

about every turn of phrase,

demanding it hit home

in a thousand ways

before making it his own,

and this I can't do alone.

Now that the singer is gone,

where shall I go for the song?

 

Without your melody and taste

to lend an attitude of grace

a lyric is an orphan thing,

a hive with neither honey's taste

nor power to truly sting.

 

What choice have I but to dare and

call your muse who thought to rest

out of the thin blue air

that out of the field of shared time,

a line or two might chance to shine --

 

As ever when we called,

in hope if not in words,

the muse descends.

 

How should she desert us now?

Scars of battle on her brow,

bedraggled feathers on her wings,

and yet she sings, she sings!

 

May she bear thee to thy rest,

the ancient bower of flowers

beyond the solitude of days,

the tyranny of hours--

the wreath of shining laurel lie

upon your shaggy head

bestowing power to play the lyre

to legions of the dead

 

If some part of that music

is heard in deepest dream,

or on some breeze of Summer

a snatch of golden theme,

we'll know you live inside us

with love that never parts

our good old Jack O'Diamonds

become the King of Hearts.

I feel your silent laughter

at sentiments so bold

that dare to step across the line

to tell what must be told,

so I'll just say I love you,

which I never said before

and let it go at that old friend

the rest you may ignore.",gratefuldead,1533852829,aikodude,5,9,True,2018-08-09

Hunter letter to Garcia - August 1996,"August 1996, Robert Hunter published this email to Jerry:
Dear JG,

It's been a year since you shuffled off the mortal coil and a lot has happened. It might surprise you to know you made every front page in the world. The press is still having fun, mostly over lawsuits challenging your somewhat ...umm... patchwork Last Will and Testament. Annabelle didn't get the EC horror comic collection, which I think would piss you off as much as anything. Nor could Dough Irwin accept the legacy of the guitars he built for you because the tax-assessment on them, icon-enriched as they are, is more than he can afford short of selling them off. The upside of the craziness is: your image is selling briskly enough that your estate should manage something to keep various wolves from various familial doors, even after the lawyers are paid. How it's to be divided will probably fall in the hands of the judge. An expert on celebrity wills said in the news that yours was a blueprint on how not to make a will.

The band decided to call it quits. I think it's a move that had to be made. You weren't exactly a sideman. But nothing's for certain. Some need at least the pretense of retirement after all these years. Can they sustain it? We'll see.

I'm writing this from England, by the way. Much clarity of perspective to be had from stepping out of the scene for a couple of months. What isn't so clear is my own role, but it's really no more problematic than it has been for the last decade. As long as I get words on paper and can lead myself to believe it's not bullshit, I'm roughly content. I'm not exactly Mr. Business.

I decided to get a personal archive together to stick on that stagnating computer site we had. Really started pouring the mustard on. I'm writing, for crying out loud, my diary on it! Besides running my ego full tilt (what's new?) I'm trying to give folks some skinny on what's going down. I don't mean I'm busting the usual suspects left and right, but am giving a somewhat less than cautious overview and soapboxing more than a little. They appointed me webmaster, and I hope they don't regret it.

There are those in the entourage who quietly believe we're washed up without you. Even should time and circumstance prove it to be so, we need to believe otherwise long enough to get some self sustaining operations going, or we'll never know for sure. It's matter of self respect. Maybe it's a long shot, but this whole fucking trip was a longshot from the start, so what else is new?

Your funeral service was one hell of a scene. Maureen and I took Barbara and Sara in and sat with them. MG waited over at our place. Manasha and Keelan were also absent. None by choice. Everybody from the band said some words and Steve, especially, did you proud, speaking with great love and candor. Annabelle got up and said you were a genius, a great guy, a wonderful friend, and a shitty father - which shocked part of the contingent and amused the rest. After awhile the minister said that that was enough talking, but I called out, from the back of the church, ""Wait, I've got something!"" and charged up the aisle and read this piece I wrote for you, my voice and hands shaking like a leaf. Man, it was weird looking over and seeing you dead!

A slew of books have come out about you and more to follow. Perspective is lacking. It's way too soon. You'd be amazed at the number of people with whom you've had a nodding acquaintance who are suddenly experts on your psychology and motivations. Your music still speaks louder than all the BS: who you were, not the messes you got yourself into. Only a very great star is afforded that much inspection and that much forgiveness.

There was so much confusion on who should be allowed to attend the scattering of your ashes that they sat around for four months. It was way too weird for this cowboy who was neither invited nor desirous of going. I said good-bye with my poem at the funeral service. It was cathartic and I didn't need an anti-climax.

A surreal sidelight: Weir went to India and scattered a handful of your ashes in the Ganges as a token of your worldwide stature. He took a lot of flak from the fans for it, which must have hurt. A bunch of them decided to scapegoat him, presumably needing someplace to misdirect their anger over the loss of you. In retrospect, I think Weir was hardest hit of the old crowd by your death. I take these things in my stride, though I admit to a rough patch here and there. But Bob took it right on the chin. Shock was written all over his face for a long time, for any with eyes to see.

Some of the guys have got bands together and are doing a tour. The fans complain it's not the same without you, and of course it isn't, but a reasonable number show up and have a pretty good time. The insane crush of the latter day GD shows is gone and that's all for the best. From the show I saw, and reports on the rest, the crowd is discovering that the sense of community is still present, matured through mutual grief over losing you. This will evolve in more joyous directions over time, but no one's looking to fill your shoes. No one has the presumption.

Been remembering some of the key talks we had in the old days, trying to suss what kind of a tiger we were riding, where it was going, and how to direct it, if possible. Driving to the city once, you admitted you didn't have a clue what to do beyond composing and playing the best you could. I agreed - put the weight on the music, stay out of politics, and everything else should follow. I trusted your musical sense and you were good enough to trust my words. Trust was the whole enchilada, looking back.

Walking down Madrone Canyon in Larkspur in 1969, you said some pretty mindblowing stuff, how we were creating a universe and I was responsible for the verbal half of it. I said maybe, but it was your way with music and a guitar that was pulling it off. You said ""That's for now. This is your time in the shadow, but it won't always be that way. I'm not going to live a long time, it's not in the cards. Then it'll be your turn."" I may be alive and kicking, but no pencil pusher is going to inherit the stratosphere that so gladly opened to you. Recalling your statement, though, often helped keep me oriented as my own star murked below the horizon while you streaked across the sky of our generation like a goddamned comet!

Though my will to achieve great things is moderated by seeing what comes of them, I've assigned myself the task of trying to honor the original vision. I'm not answerable to anybody but my conscience, which, if less than spotless, doesn't keep me awake at night. Maybe it's best, personally speaking, that the power to make contracts and deal the remains of what was built through the decades rests in other hands. I wave the flag and rock the boat from time to time, since I believe much depends on it, but will accept the outcome with equanimity.

Just thought it should be said that I no longer hold your years of self inflicted decline against you. I did for awhile, felt ripped off, but have come to understand that you were troubled and compromised by your position in the public eye far beyond anyone's powers to deal with. Star shit. Who can you really trust? Is it you or your image they love? No one can understand those dilemmas in depth except those who have no choice but to live them. You whistled up the whirlwind and it blew you away. Your substance of choice made you more malleable to forces you would have brushed off with a characteristic sneer in earlier days. Well, you know it to be so. Let those who pick your bones note that it was not always so.

So here I am, writing a letter to a dead man, because it's hard to find a context to say things like this other than to imagine I have your ear, which of course I don't. Only to say that what you were is more startlingly apparent in your absence than ever it was in the last decade. I remember sitting in the waiting room of the hospital through the days of your first coma. Not being related, I wasn't allowed into the intensive care unit to see you until you came to and requested to see me. And there you were - more open and vulnerable than I'd ever seen you. You grasped my hand and began telling me your visions, the crazy densely packed phantasmagoria way beyond any acid trip, the demons and mechanical monsters that taunted and derided, telling you endless bad jokes and making horrible puns of everything - and then you asked, point blank, ""Have I gone insane?"" I said ""No, you've been very sick. You've been in a coma for days, right at death's door. They're only hallucinations, they'll go away. You survived."" ""Thanks,"" you said. ""I needed to hear that.""

Your biographers aren't pleased that I don't talk to them, but how am I to say stuff like this to an interviewer with an agenda? I sometimes report things that occur to me about you in my journal, as the moment releases it, in my own way, in my own time, and they can take what they want of that.

Obviously, faith in the underlying vision which spawned the Grateful Dead might be hard to muster for those who weren't part of the all night rap sessions circa 1960-61 ... sessions that picked up the next morning at Kepler's bookstore then headed over to the Stanford cellar or St. Mike's to continue over coffee and guitars. There were no hippies in those days and the beats had bellied up. There was only us vs. 50's consciousness. There no jobs to be had if we wanted them. Just folk music and tremendous dreams. Yeah, we dreamed our way here. I trust it. So did you. Not so long ago we wrote a song about all that, and you sang it like a prayer. The Days Between. Last song we ever wrote.

Context is lost, even now. The sixties were a long time ago and getting longer. A cartoon version of our times satisfies public perception. Our continuity is misunderstood as some sort of strange persistence of an outmoded style. Beads, bell bottoms and peace signs. But no amount of pop cynicism can erase the suspicion, in the minds of the present generation, that something was going on once that was better than what's going on now. And I sense that they're digging for ""what it is"" and only need the proper catalyst to find it for themselves. Your guitar is like a compass needle pointing the strange way there. I'm wandering far afield from the intention of this letter, a year's report, but this year wasn't made up only of events following your death in some roughly chronological manner. It reached down to the roots of everything, shook the earth off, and inspected them. The only constant is the fact that you remain silent. Various dances are done around that fact.

Don't misconstrue me, I don't waste much time in grief. Insofar as you were able, you were an exponent of a dream in the continual act of being defined into a reality. You had a massive personality and talent to present it to the world. That dream is the crux of the matter, and somehow concerns beauty, consciousness and community. We were, and are, worthy insofar as we serve it. When that dream is dead, there'll be time enough for true and endless grief.

John Kahn died in May, same day Leary did. Linda called 911 and they came over and searched the house, found a tiny bit of coke and carted her off to jail in shock. If the devil himself isn't active in this world, there's sure something every bit as mean: institutional righteousness without an iota of fellow feeling. But, as I figure, that's the very reason the dream is so important - it's whatever is the diametric opposite of that. Human kindness.

Trust me that I don't walk around saying ""this was what Jerry would have wanted"" to drive my points home. What you wanted is a secret known but to yourself. You said 'yes' to what sounded like a good idea at the time, 'no' to what sounded like a bad one. I see more of what leadership is about, in the absence of it. It's an instinct for good ideas. An aversion to bad ones. Compromise on indifferent ones. Power is another matter. Power is not leadership but coercion. People follow leaders because they want to.

I know you were often sick and tired of the conflicting demands made on you by contentious forces you invited into your life and couldn't as easily dismiss. You once said to me, in 1960, ""just say yes to everybody and do what you damn well want."" Maybe, but when every 'yes' becomes an IOU payable in full, who's coffer is big enough to pay up? ""Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke!"" would be a characteristic reply. Unfortunately, you're not around to explain what was a joke and what wasn't. It all boils down to signed pieces of paper with no punch lines appended.

I know what I'm saying in this letter can be taken a hundred ways. As always, I just say what occurs to me to say and can't say what doesn't. Could I write a book about you? No. Didn't know you well enough. Let those who knew you even less write them. You were canny enough to keep your own self to yourself and let your fingers do the talking. Speaking of 'personal matters' was never your shtick.

Our friendship was testy. I challenged you rather more than you liked, having a caustic tongue. In later years you preferred the company of those capable of keeping it light and non-judgmental. I think it must always be that way with prominent and powerfully gifted persons. I don't say that, for the most part, your inner circle weren't good and true. They'd have laid down their lives for you. I'd have had to think about it. I mean, a star is a star is a star. There's no reality check. If the truth were known, you were too well loved for your own good, but that smacks of psychologizing and I drop the subject forthwith

All our songs are acquiring new meanings. I don't deny writing with an eye to the future at times, but our mutual folk, blues and country background gave us a mutual liking for songs that dealt with sorrow and the dark issues of life. Neither of us gave a fuck for candy coated shit, psychedelic or otherwise. I never even thought of us as a ""pop band."" You had to say to me one day, after I'd handed over the Eagle Mall suite, ""Look, Hunter - we're a goddamn dance band, for Christ's sake! At least write something with a beat!"" Okay. I handed over Truckin' next. How was I to know? I thought we were silver and gold; something new on this Earth. But the next time I tried to slip you the heavy stuff, you actually went for it. Seems like you'd had the vision of the music about the same time I had the vision of the words, independently. Terrapin. Shame about the record, but the concert piece, the first night it was played, took me about as close as I ever expect to get to feeling certain we were doing what we were put here to do. One of my few regrets is that you never wanted to finish it, though you approved of the final version I eked out many years later. You said, apologetically, ""I love it, but I'll never get the time to do it justice."" I realized that was true. Time was the one thing you never had in the last decade and a half. Supporting the Grateful Dead plus your own trip took all there was of that. The rest was crashing time. Besides, as you once said, ""I'd rather toss cards in a hat than compose."" But man, when you finally got down on it, you sure knew how.

The pressure of making regular records was a creative spur for a long time, but poor sales put the economic weight on live concerts where new material wasn't really required, so my role in the group waned. A difficult time for me, being at my absolute peak and all. I had to go on the road myself to make a living. It was good for me. I developed a sense of self direction that didn't depend on the Dead at all. This served well for the songs we were still to write together. You sure weren't interested in flooding the market. You knew one decent song was worth a dozen cobbled together pieces of shit, saved only by arrangement. I guess we have a few of those too, but the percentage is respect ably low. Pop songs come and go, blossom and wither, but we scored a piece of Americana, my friend. Sooner or later, they'll notice what we did doesn't die the way we do. I've always believed that and so did you. Once in awhile we'd even call each other ""Mister"" and exchange congratulations. Other people are starting to record those songs now, and they stand on their own.

For some reason it seems worthwhile to maintain the Grateful Dead structures: Rex, the website, GDP, the deadhead office, the studio ... even with the band out of commission. I don't know if this is some sort of denial that the game is finished, or if the intuitive impulse is a sound one. I feel it's better to have it than not, just in case, because once it's gone there's no bringing it back. The forces will disperse and settle elsewhere. A business that can't support itself is, of course, no business at all, just a locus of dissension, so the reality factor will rule. Diminished as we are without you, there is still some of the quick, bright spirit around. I mean, you wouldn't have thrown in your lot with a bunch of belly floppers, would you?

Let me see - is there anything I've missed? Plenty, but this seems like a pretty fat report. You've been gone a year now and the boat is still afloat. Can we make it another year? What forms will it assume? It's all kind of exciting. They say a thousand years are only a twinkle in God's eye. Is that so?

Missing you in a longtime way.

Bird Song 6/23/2018,"One of my favorite renditions. Why? The teases and the jams!

***First tease***: starts at 7:30 - 8:34
It picks up at 7:42, hits another stride at 7:56. During this tease I'm thinking “Wow that was cool. Sounded like Truckin. Wouldn’t mind hearing that again”

***Second tease***: 12:26 - 13:32 
Starting at 12:59 It gets ripping! I'm thinking to myself ""A second time? Another truckin buildup? This has gotta be it."" But then it mellows out back to Bird Song again and the band jams for a bit.

***Third tease***: 14:00 - 14:42
""This has got to be the &gt; Truckin transition!"" John (and Justin Vernon?) at 14:06 starts the build-up....14:23 it gets *red hot* again. ""Fuck yeah, here it [the Truckin riff] comes...."" But then back to Bird Song again!

If psychedelics are religion then the Grateful Dead are gospel,"side note: find me a better Morning Dew than Europe 72.

I've long said that the ""Dead are Dao"". The Daoist philosophy (in it's most rudimentary sense) is centered around chaos and order being the two most fundamental forces of nature. More specifically that from chaos emerges order, and that order it will in turn disintegrate into chaos (You should be hearing themes of the Big Bang here). On the vinyl Europe 72, this expression of Dao is presented most subliminally in the Grateful Dead's music. Side 5 of the record features an incredible recording of Truckin'. Truckin', is a very 50's style rock'n'roll tune from Weir. They begin playing Truckin' at the Lyceum and as soon as the song ends they continue to stretch the performance out in to some of the best acid/jazz/improv the Dead have on recording. The order of the uptight 50's rock'n'roll soon descends into utter chaos, that will leave uninitiated wondering ""what the fuck are we listening to?"". Any seasoned deadhead will not be scared off by the dissonance and disharmony, as this performance bleeds into a multi-minute section of cacophony. The Dead, better than any band before or sense, understood the necessity of peaks and valleys in a performance. Just like any great piece of literature the Dead understood that to achieve true glory, all cannot remain perfect and peaceful. As the record flips and the chaos becomes far too much to bear, the Dead transition into (what I believe) is there most glorious performance of Morning Dew ever. It is the stuff of legends. The kind of thing that will send chills down the spines of the most dose soaked deadhead and the greenest of participants. Over sides A and B of the final record of Europe 72, Order decomposes into Chaos, only to have Chaos miraculously rescind to Order once again. I have been hard pressed to find a performance that more perfectly encapsulates that indescribable beauty that is the Grateful Dead than the end of Europe 72. For those who have not been baptized in the torrents of terrapin, we all seem like lunatics listening to never ending songs. However, for those fortunate enough to have drunk the blood of Garcia and eaten the flesh of Lesh, Europe 72 is a hallmark of the holy. 

The Dead are Dao.  ",gratefuldead,1534055869,AmPornGifs,9,11,True,2018-08-12

Trying to get into Phish,"Long time deadhead, on the bus since 1978
By old time Dead tour buddy is now into Phish.
I have been to a few shows and their songs just dont do it for me. Their isn't a single Phish original I like. I find the covers really lacking.
Just listened to a Phish tape doing Talking Heads cities and I like the talking heads better. I dont even think they do covers well.
Take All along the watchtower. Hendrix did it best.
Desperado, Ronstadt did it best
The Weight, i played the GD version for a huge Levon fan. After he heard it, he said the Dead do it the best

"One of the first times seeing Phil and Friends around somewhere between 1999, and 2002. I was given a huge box filled with cassette tapes(around 60), those tapes combined with a 1989 Chevy Conversion van that had a cassette player changed my life.","Every cassette in the box had a case, and every case had date/location, set lists and hand drawn art, sometimes the art included stamps with stealies, bears, skeletons, and well you get the idea. Especially because this sort of collection was, and is super common for the crowd at a dead show, so I don't really need to go any **further** ^:) explaining it.

A quick google search returned this [image](https://i.imgur.com/vwTikl6.jpg). Now this isn't my box, but its very similar to what is in this image.

A few years ago, I met a kid who was about the same age I was when the box was gifted to me. He was `me from the past` which I'm sure people here can relate to. He was bright eyed and just getting into the dead.

Giving him that box felt better than when I originally received the box at a show, especially because I added a few tapes to that box myself. The look on his face, and knowing how I felt when it happened to me, priceless. Hopefully one day, he too will get to experience that feeling, of giving the box away to someone who will appreciate it, an **Unbroken Chain** if you will.

I haven't had a car with a cassette player since the van I mentioned earlier. I sold van to to a Wookie years ago, well it was traded he didn't pay for it with money money, he paid for it by bartering, but that's another story for another time.

I just started driving a new car. Well it's an old car, but it's new to me. It has a cassette player. I no longer own a single cassette.

I'm happy I gave the tapes away to a deserving young man. But I just wish I had at least 1 tape to throw in the cassette player in my car.",gratefuldead,1534089600,mrhodesit,8,20,True,2018-08-12

Tour Stories - I know some of you may think these rank up there with war stories,"On the Trail of the Dead: Misadventures and other close calls.  By Ificouldonlyremember

First shows I saw were MSG 9/20, 9/21/1982. Seats so high up in the blue ring I could almost touch the ceiling. Remember being puzzled. Next I saw the two Brendan Byrne shows where Stephen Stills came on Stage 4/16, 4/17/1983. I was a huge CSN, and Neil, fan, so I was hooked. Of course Stephen Stills did not show up every night. I mostly saw East Coast and Summer shows, Very few California shows: Greek Spring 85, New Years 86 &amp; 87. I really regret I never made it to Red Rocks. Most shows I saw with my taping partner and best friend from high school and college.

First time we went to Worcester Fall 1984, I may have been a little altered before the show, a motorcycle cop frisks me for no good reason, luckily I am clean. Saw many shows there, not just Dead, and every time we went to Worcester after that, we would see the same guy striking some macho pose somewhere.

Providence 1985: older classman hitches a ride with us. Showed up already drunk carrying 6-pack. Get to Providence, ironically park right outside the police station. After the show I found a pair of brass knuckles on the street next to my car. Idiot is drinking beer walking down street. Police officer tells him to pour it out, he argues, grabbed, he pushes back. Other officers come running over and drag him into alley. We leave before he comes out.

Somewhere in Ohio Summer 1985, we crash in an over-crowed campground. In the morning owner has a fit, and we bail ASAP. Parked outside when police go roaring in. Similar situation after some Philly show, over-crowded motel, 20 deadheads in every room, my friend who was driving nudged the bumper of a police car on the way out of the parking lot and yet somehow miraculously we manage to get away.

Rochester Fall 1985: Friends bought an old school bus, going on tour old school. Would we like to ride to Rochester with them? No. Bus drivetrain exploded in the middle of NY state. Saw them arriving as we walked out of show. After second show we drove all night back to central CT in order to go to class next morning.

Hampton 1986: Did not have tickets for first night, but do have extra pair each for other two. Make big sign, find someone to trade. Afterwards sell other pair for face value to a waiting couple. That was the ethos. I thank my dear friend Peter for first pointing that out to me.

Kingswood, Toronto, 6/30/87: For some reason I did not go to this particular show. FYI: When you are going through Canadian customs, wrapping a bong up in a towel and shoving it into the trunk does not constitute hiding it. Moved car to holding area, searched, found a small amount of combustibles, did not find some tiny little scraps of paper. Friends afraid going to jail, finally told to leave and go back to US. They walk out to their car and drive off into Canada. Made show and back safely to US.

1987 Capitol Theater Landover Maryland: Kicked out of show before it even started for bad behavior. Went outside and traded for a new ticket, actually a good seat by stage on Phil’s side. See same security agent. He keeps looking at me, but cannot be sure I am the same person.

After first night at Oxford 1988, we slept in my car, and I foolishly had parked in a fire lane. In the morning drove down the road right before the police arrived and started searching everyone. That could have been unfortunate for me.  Afterwards we went swimming in a lake and I saw a vision I remember to this day.

Two friends are driving cross-country. Middle Missouri spotted and tailed by car full of DEA agents going to conference. They “fit the profile”. Pulled over by local police. DEA agents salivating at prospect of major drug bust. Separated, both tell same story, small amount marijuana under dashboard. Actually carrying something all together different wrapped up in sleeping bag. That morning my friend packed sleeping bag, decided he did not like it, and re-packed. Searching car, finding nothing, agent picks up sleeping bag, squeezes it then tosses on ground. Taken to station, local police fed up with big shot agents. They write driver ticket for an illegal lane change, believe it or not a traffic ticket, and they are let go.

Acquaintance driving through Colorado in brother’s car. Pulled over: Officer: “Is this your car?” “ No my brother’s” Officer: “Is that your brother’s Grateful Dead sticker?” Foolishly, “No it is mine”.  Officer “Then I know if I search your car I will find drugs”, and he did.

Some things were very different in the 80’s. N2O balloons were not yet a problem. MDMA ecstasy was legal until 1986. Legal marijuana was but a pipe dream, literally. And most people still smoked brown imported pot unless they had some really good connections. I used to have a matched pair of Aiwa tape decks I kept in constant motion making copies of my masters to trade for this and that.

It was not all fun and games. In the early ‘80s there was a security agency called The A-Team based in CT. Completely unprofessional biggest group of assholes and bullies. They handled all the security for New Haven, one of the reasons the Dead stopped going there. New Haven Coliseum was ringed by doors leading right out onto the street. One night some friend knocked down one of these guys and only about 1000 people rushed in before they could close the door.

Saratoga 1984: Perhaps I was partying more than was wise. With a group of friends. Cannot find them after show. Totally lost wandering around all night. The grounds are huge there. Finally find my car in the morning. Closest I came to a really bad mental experience.

I have actually seen more really messed up bad shit happen outside other non-Dead shows. I have seen more than enough people get arrested.",gratefuldead,1534099615,Ificouldonlyremember,1,17,True,2018-08-12

Recreate the Wall of Sound!,"Im stoned:

SO im replying to this guy right and we're talking about a wall of sound festival and since Im high I did the math and you guys, I think we could do it! Ill paste down here what I replied to his post but I felt like it outgrew just a comment.

\~\~The im bored just link me to a cool show\~\~

9/17/82

[https://archive.org/details/gd1982-09-17.aud.wise.91483.sbeok.flac16](https://archive.org/details/gd1982-09-17.aud.wise.91483.sbeok.flac16)

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

ANYWAYS lets build a Wall!

So we need at least like lets say 5 million right?(500,000 for the band 500,000 for ""security"" 2 mil for the wall and one mill to fix the problems)

First break down the donation amounts:

Miracle donor: 25,000

Rich Donation: 5,000

Someone really wants to see it: 1,000

Tickets: 100

I need a miracle: 0

I can probably say at least 12 people would be miracle donations. Not all at once of course nor at the beginning but I do think if we could raise enough at the beginning at least a dozen “famous” deadheads would be down. Maybe not but I have a hunch

Alot of heads are pretty well off. Obviously not the majority but c’mon we all know we boogie with some pretty rich cats from time to time. I got miracled a seat ticket at shorline face value was almost $200! I really think about 500 would donate this amount.

I myself really want to see this happen! I dont know exactly how many people this can be but I figure we just take the number of box sets that grateful dead sells at a time and use that to estimate! I mean everyone knows the shows are literally a few soconds on a keyboard away from streaming live on your device of choice. -And anyone who really cares knows how to find them in a better formant ;)- So if there are 15,000 people willing to spend $100 on a cool box and some CD’s I honestly think its safe to assume there are 15,000 people willing to spend $1000 to create and experience something that could possibly change the world (or the history of the dead)

Next is tickets. A quick google search shows that in 2017 there were 623,000 tickets sold. BUT we need to break that down. First 15% off attributed to “tour heads” who are the same person with mulitiple tickets.(529,500) Then of those people I estimate another 15% did not buy tickets.(415,117) Next I’ll just assume only half of those people really want to go to the wall of sound experience(200,00) And then half of that group may “really want to see this happen” or not give a damn if it happens. In addition though I honestly think this could become a major event. Some kind of cultural reckoning for the modern day and age. I think 100,000 GA tickets could be sold! I think $100 is a pretty fair price for a show. I feel like this isnt too much to earn and save even when you are a homeless musician (read my old posts that was my life) and certaily would create a much “hipper” scene than say Outside Lands which is $400. So to anyone with an interest in the dead spending just $100 to again create and experience the actual Wall in all its glory! What a bargain! Plus just like Dead and Co it will attract plenty of the general festival crew and some other people who may not be heads but are down to check out some kind of “wall of sound” experience.  $100 to create a literal deadhead paradise. Many different cultures (organic farmers, baby boomers, marijuana proffesionals, confused teenagers) would be interested in a $100 ticket to an amazing day and a different life, if even temporarily.

Adding it all up (im writing this all on the fly, also interested to see the result):  
 

12(25,000) + 100(5,000) + 15,000(1,000) + 100,000(100) =

300,000 + 500,000 + 15,000,000 + 10,000,000=

25,800,000

SO maybe I messed the math up but it looks like this is doeable. Like very doable. If anyone would like to help please message me I guess or go start your own groups working towards this goal. We should be very radical about this.

TLDR: We are the future. The future is right now. Lets build a wall of sound.",gratefuldead,1534132709,Jaywix,9,3,True,2018-08-12
Have any of you ever dragged a reluctant friend to a show?,"I'm unskilled in the subtle conversion of friends into Deadheads.  It seems I always come on too hard or soft for my passion to ever really rub off on those not already interested.

&amp;nbsp;

Above all, however, my SO simply loathes their music and will bitch and moan whenever I try to play it in any context.  I think way back I might've overzealously talked up my love for the band, to the point where I creeped her out and scared her away from ever even considering enjoying it.  One special occasion when we decided to trip (only time), I played it, and she was totally grooving to it though she'll hardly admit this now.

&amp;nbsp;

As a playful ultimatum I've told her that I want to take her to a Dead and Company show at which point I'll shut the hell up about the band forever.  This got me thinking--**have any of you ever dragged a reluctant friend to a show?**  Was the experience torture for them?  Did they become instant converts?  Something in between?

&amp;nbsp;

For the record I've long abandoned any ""imposition"" approach to the Grateful Dead anymore.  Everyone digs what they dig and obviously that will never change sometimes...I get that.  But I guess with some people (ex. significant others, close friends, family members, etc), it's easy to be a little bummed that you'll never have the powerful connection with them that is sharing a Dead show, and it's easy (for me at least) to feel the urge to (if necessary) drag them there and have them decide for themselves at least once.

Funny little thing just happened,"So I'm in a coffee shop, trying to get some reading done for my classes. I've got 4/30/77 on, and I've been enjoying its classic '77 Dead sound. As the Scarlet Begonias jam disintegrates and the band starts with Fire on the Mountain, as usual, it grabs my attention, especially as Jerry plays the main riff. I could kinda hear that his Q-Tron isn't working properly, but when he finally fixed it and it got that classic ""wah"" sound, I felt that feeling we get when the band is ""on."" The guitar tone was so tasty that I HAD to look up from my book. Know what my eyes first caught on the wall of that coffee shop?

Dick's Picks (Re-?)Release by REAL GONE MUSIC,"TLDR: Bought Dick's Picks 6 (10/14/83) at a music store for $45. Turns out it's actually a release by ""Real Gone Music"". Should I be angry?

So, ever since Dave's Pick 27 (09/02/83) was announced, and I was born in '83, I wanted to track down and buy any official releases from '83. Turns out there's only one, and it is DP6. So lo and behold, the local record store, Magnolia Thunderpussy, had DP6. I was shocked! $45 dollars and I bought it. When I got home and really started digging in to it, it turns out it is not an original and is actually from 2015 or so and released by Real Gone Music. I feel like I got hosed.

  I was listening to the scarlet on ""From The Mars Hotel"" and got to her vocals at the end of it. Perfect. The first show I listened to ""The Closing Of Winterland"" and her vocals on scarlet was what drew me in and think these guys have really got something. It just fits the super spacey jazzy vibes so well. Starlets with out her just feel like they are missing something.

Anyways I'm not trying to tell people who don't like her they are wrong. I love people having there own opinions. Im just a little high and wanted to express my eternal love for Donna on Scarlet Begonias

Favorite Keith moments in E72\in general?,"I've been getting super into E72 lately, since I've not yet listened to a bunch of shows, and Keith absolutely shines in almost every set 2/3 jam, whether it be 5/26 Epilogue/Prelude or 4/8 MLBJ in Dark Star, he absolutely kills it and makes the piano an absolute force to be reckoned with.

I listened to the 4/24 DS &gt; M&amp;MU &gt; DS &gt; Wharf Rat earlier today and was absolutely blown away at the level of what would become 73s ""space jazz"" sound that I heard in it, there wasn't a single time I didn't feel like the band wasn't playing as anything but a single unit and the way Keith would play with the rest of the rhythm section and compliment Jerrys lead was utterly absurd in how, live, they were able to make shit sound so next level out there and *psychedelic*, almost mystically out of the pool of fractal imagery that they wove. I like to believe the avant garde leanings of European musicians in the early 70s and late 60s was a really big contributor to their sound and the locations themselves.

4/16s  Truckin' &gt; TOO/Space &gt; The Other One &gt; Me &amp; My Uncle &gt; The Other One &gt; Not Fade Away &gt; Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad &gt; Not Fade Away another example of just outright weird playing by them, and Truckin wastes no time in going from just a normal day at the office to sounding straight out of the playbook of a philosophers neologisms concerning a world composed entirely of the abstract. It barely even fits into the confines of ""The Other One"" aside from the lyrics as much as it is a journey into interstellar space and slowly watching the Earth and other planets disappear as the Sun itself loses its ""unique"" aspects of itself and you just become enveloped in entirely your sense of self disappearing and becoming one with the playing, only to be drawn back into the normal music itself of the post long jam section and normal life. It's pretty fucking great.

Anyone have anything they'd like to share? I think people sometimes underplay Keiths contributions while simultaneously just passively acknowledging he played piano for them in their most popular years.",gratefuldead,1530915981,PhlegmeseeJed,4,5,True,2018-07-06

Ideal Setlist Game,"Hey all:

So I'm fairly new to the Dead community, but saw my first Dead &amp; Co. show at Riverbend earlier this year, and have been absolutely obsessed ever since. So it got me thinking, as I continue to listen to show after show... what is everyone's ideal setlist? I am sure this has been done on this sub before, but haven't seen anything about it recently, so thought I'd post and see if anyone wanted to post their ideal setlist.

Obviously this will show my noob status to the Dead, and my affinity for American Beauty... but this is where I am currently on what I would love to see in an ideal show. Hopefully we can have a nice little discussion here and have some fun with it :) 

**Parameters**:

1. 17-20 songs total
2. Must include Drums &amp; Space
3. In the order you want them to appear
4. 1 song for encore is included in your total
5. Can include any GD or Dead &amp; Co. song or cover

**My ideal setlist (from my new-to-Dead mind)**

*Set 1:*

1. Shakedown Street

2. Sugaree

3. It Hurts Me Too

4. Ripple

5.China Cat Sunflower &gt;

6. I Know You Rider

7. Tennessee Jed

8. Sugar Magnolia

9. Morning Dew

*Set 2:*

10. Truckin’ &gt;

11. Bertha

12.Scarlet Begonias

13. Dark Star &gt;

14. Drums &gt;

15. Space

16. Friend of the Devil

17. U.S. Blues

Was out camping a few weeks ago with a hat of mine loaded with pins. Yeah, I know, baaaddddd idea.

Tried looking on ebay and could only find one for 100 bucks. I'm a college kid, don't have that kind of money to be spending on pins especially with the amount of shows I still plan on hitting up by the end of the year. Basically just wanted to ask if anyone knew of anywhere else I could look, if anyone had a spare they'd sell for a reasonable price, etc. It would mean a lot to me as it was my first show.

Thank you Jerry, for a real good time. And thank you for letting there be songs to fill the air, that now have been given new life and hopefully we will see years and years of the Dead.

How did the fan atmosphere surrounding the Grateful Dead evolve to the point it did in 1995?,"I am a younger fan of the Grateful Dead (was 6 in 95) so the only interaction I have had with fans has been at Dead and Company shows, which I have enjoyed immensely.  I am very fascinated with the history surrounding the band and their unique evolution and collection of fans throughout time (from Ken Kesey and the electric kool-aid acid test to seeing Bill Walton standing tall amongst a field of fans spanning greater than a half century of music history).  However, from reading into their history, something that I can’t grasp is how intense/negative the overall fan atmosphere was toward the end in 1995 (how something so wonderful and fantastic grew towards an ending with a tour from hell).  I understand that Jerry’s health was not good and the band wasn’t playing the quality shows it had in the past, but when/how did the crowd change to get to the point it did in 1995?  I know Dead and Company is not the Grateful Dead but rather more a continuation of the beauty this band brought, but the energy and friendliness I have found at these shows have been amazing and I couldn’t imagine a toxic atmosphere like many people described 95 to be.  I may also be talking out my ass because I never experienced a Grateful Dead show with Jerry Garcia, but more insight into this time period would be greatly appreciated!

Anyone want to discuss Selvin's book? By which I mean here is my solipistic opinion and I would love validation. Or discussion. Or spirited F-Us,"So, I feel that the Leshes got treated poorly, even if accurately, as many of the things were subject to opinion and points of view. I also think the throwaway line that Billy once grabbed Jill's breasts while drunk being ""forgiven not forgotten"" is bullshit. It wouldn't matter to me how long a relationship has been or what it was... Someone did that to my wife, I would never ever forgive them.

In addition, reading between the lines, and from what I have picked up over the years and from all the domestic violence and multiple divorces, Billy K is as a person, a douche nozzle. I am kind of ""judgy"", as I don't truly know the full circumstances but it seems habitual and repetitive ""frat boy"" behavior. (I separate a person from their art, BTW)

Second, the different visions as the author porrtayed, between how Phil and Bobby approached the music made 100&amp;#37; sense. Ergo slow and low versus loud and fast.... 

I liked how Mr. Selvin tied it all up at the end. He made me realize how truly final, how truly perfect, and how truly Grateful Dead the Fare Thee Well tour was.

The DS on Dick's Picks 2...,"(There isn't a lot of substance to this post, sorry)

I'm sinking deeper and deeper into the Dead; I wouldn't consider them the greatest band of all time, but paradoxically they're becoming my favorite. I decided to listen to *Dick's Picks Volume 3* (10/31/71) before bed, mainly because it's the shortest and I don't have time for a full-on all-out one right now (I have listened to 3, 4 and 36 before).

At first I wasn't all that impressed with this ""Dark Star""; I guess I've listened to the *Live/Dead* (and a few other '69 versions) so many times that it wasn't what I was expecting. It was less focused and more meandering; not bad at all, but not as immediately memorable as the *Live/Dead* version was when I first heard it.

But then, about 14 minutes in, the jam suddenly went to a place so unexpected and honestly *gorgeous* that I started laughing at how fucking *good* it was. I had been ready to write it off, maybe even dig around for another, but the Dead reeled me back in and didn't let go from then on.

Then they went somewhere no less compelling that I can't even begin to describe, before transitioning into ""Sugar Magnolia"" in a way that *melted my face*.

I'm sure they have dozens and dozens of other shows that are greater, that I will eventually get to and lose myself in, but this may have been my peak experience listening to the Dead so far. I have no doubt other moments will top it, but I guess I'm just saying I love this band is all.

D&amp;C's Morning Dew from 6/30/2018,"Relistened to the show in Eugene, OR, and I just finished listening to Morning Dew again.  Listening to it on the Couch Tour made me cry! That was among the most intense pieces of music I've heard EVER. John's playing was absolutely face-melting. He kept bringing the song to a higher peak with every measure. Billy and Mickey were adding in some terrific fills. Oteil just has something special with his playing, providing a wonderful backbone for the song. Jeff's wizardry, of course, was there too. And of course, Bob on vocals provides that extra magic that makes Dead and Co. extra ""Dead"".

A Boulder residents guide to Boulder Dead and Co. Tons of info.,"I've seen lots of people asking questions so I just want to lay out a couple of the important deets.

1. Folsom field has changed their bag policy this year. Def check out their website as it's more similar to the NFL policy.

2. Parking is expensive but Folsom is smack in the middle of campus which is smack in the middle of Boulder.... aka lots of free parking in neighborhoods around the area. Check out any of the streets on the Hill (area across Broadway street where a lot of students live). Also check out Madison Ave or Adams Ave off of 30th Ave. Also, Pine or Spruce or Mapleton between Folsom st and 28th. Finally, if you have a camper, a lot of people park it between 28th and 30th on mapleton near the ballfields. It'll be fine for the weekend and it's 1.5 miles to the venue.

3. There are several after parties/after shows all over town. The Fox theater on the Hill is having one, the Boulder theatre, The Post Brewery on Pearl (opened by the former headmaster brewer at dogfishhead. Amazing homestyle food and beer), the bohemian biergarten on Pearl, the LazyDog on Pearl, etc etc. So if you're a little too high still, there's plenty to do on the Hill (across Broadway) or on The Pearl st Mall (a short 20 walk from the stadium.

4. Food after the show will be found in the same places (the Hill and Pearl). A lot of pizza but one of my favorite late night spots is Illegal Pete's on 15th and Pearl. Open til 2am and serves up food similar to Chipotle but much better. There will be more Late night options on the Hill as it's the student area. There's a place there called Half Fast subs which is around 10 minutes walk from Folsom. Tons of subs to choose from and open late.

5. Dispensaries are everywhere however there are winners and there are losers... I've shopped at almost every dispensary in town and have been smoking for a good long while... here's my favorites and why. 

Verde Natural (3rd and Pearl). Best bud in Boulder hands down possibly the best on the front range. Soil grown, organic, gorgeous flower and a super friendly staff. I'd never smoke anything else except that it is pricey ($180-$300ozs out the door). But if you want the best... go there.

Magnolia Road (30th and Canyon). Best prices on anything non-flower. I never buy edibles anywhere else. If you want edibles, go here. Incredible selection as well. Flower is good enough and reasonably priced.

Helping Hands Herbals(10th and Pearl). Another place that produces phenomenal flower. Also all organic, they do all their genetics in house and have produced some unique and killer flowers. Again, a bit pricey but if you want good flower, this is my second choice.

14er Holistics (Mapleton between 28th and 30th). I love this store. They frequently have ounces for $125 and I think it's the best flower to coat ratio in boulder. You can usually walk out of there with an ounce of something incredible for under $180. They have the only Jack Herer I know of in Boulder. They work directly with Jack Herer's son to ensure the phenos and Genos stay true to the flower the man himself grew.

If you have an ID (drivers license or passport) you can legally buy cannabis in Colorado! So go enjoy it. I believe you can now buy up to an OZ with any ID (used to just be a 1/4 with out of state). Keep in mind, that ounce limit is for 1 dispensary. So if you want say edibles and an ounce, you can buy an ounce from wherever then go somewhere else and buy edibles!

6. Food! My favorite

The Post (13th and Pearl) like I said earlier, the old headmaster brewer from dogfish head opened this place up. It's a little on the expensive side (not crazy but not $10 either) but they do homestyle southern cooking and family style eating. So you order large baskets of incredible fried chicken then large portions of food like mashed potatoes, beet salads, coleslaw, mac n cheese, chard, etc. Did I also mention the beer is fantastic?

Hapa Sushi (Pearl between 11th and Broadway) some guys I play soccer with helped start this place. Phenomenal sushi for a landlocked state way above sea level. Their vegetarian roll is the best I've ever had but everything is wonderful! They have happy hour everyday (except Sunday) from 2:30-5:30pm as well as a late night happy hour from 10:00-12:00 Friday and Saturday. You can get two rolls for $8 which for us sushi freaks is an unheard of price. The food is truly outstanding.

West End Tavern (Pearl between 9th and 10th) Again more homestyle cooking but it's fantastic. Think BBQ and fried chicken. This place also has the biggest selection of whiskey (maybe in the state) as well as a ton of unique and small batch beer. Amazing rooftop with a perfect view of the flatirons.

Mountain Sun (Pearl between 15th and 16th). The quintessential Dead bar in Boulder. Usually Dead music playing, amazing beer, and fantastic bar food. I hate calling it bar food because it's so much better but it's burgers, sandwiches, salads, wings etc. Lots of cool dead/music related memorabilia ok the wall.

Fior Di Latte (Pearl between 14th and 15th) best god damn ice cream (it's gelato in reality) in the city with a ton of fresh made selections. I love that place and figured a few stones heads might as well :)

7. What to do before and after? If you have time there are some great day activities in Boulder. A few of my recommendations.

Saturday morning farmers market. Frequently named one of the best in the country, the Boulder County Farmers Market is located on 13th street between canyon and arapahoe. It starts early (8 or 9 i believe) and runs until 2. Tons of good produce, food, food trucks, fruits, etc. My favorite is the Palisade peaches that are now in season. Best peaches in the country (aside from maybe Georgia).

Boulder book store on Pearl is a must for anyone who likes to read or enjoys a good bookstore. 3 levels of books, they have about anything you can think of.

Hike chataqua. Those flatirons (what we call those huge rocks right next to boulder as t looks like a clothes iron presses into the mountainside) are gorgeous from a distance but even better to hike around. If you're an experienced hiker try the Royal Arch Trail. Do not do this trail if you are not adequately prepared. It's not super super tough but it's about 3 hours round trip with decent elevation gain. So worth it.

Drive up baseline road. If you follow baseline west it turns into flagstaff road which weaves its way up the mountain. There are several places to stop for great views of boulder. There is another place called Realizaiton Point that has great trails (that are much easier as you start higher up). And my favorite place is a half mile or so pat realization point called Lookout Gulch. Beautiful view of the continental divide. You can see 14 or 15 13k+ Peaks in the distance.

Fiske Planetarium. Right on campus. It is one of the most state-of-the-art planetariums in the country. Tonight they have a laser show using their famous LiquidSky visualizer with some incredible Dead shows from 77. So if your eyes are wide a little early in the day, check out a show. It's totally worth it to even just see an hour long movie there.

Escape room on Pearl. If you've never done an escape room then your missing out! You and up to 7 friends get put in a room and have to solve a mystery together by finding clues and connecting dots. It's a ton of fun when you're a little spun :)

There is a ton to do around town and the mountains but tthose are some of my favorites that don't take a ton of time.

Post-show some of my favorite things to do are walk around the gorgeous CU campus, go down to Boulder creek which runs right through town and listen to the river, going down to Pearl and busking a bit.

8. Be Kind. We keep getting invited back because our Scene is easy to manage. The cops are totally handsoff as long as you don't act a complete full. This means drinking, smoking, and fun are all fully permissible in the parking lot. No worries about undercovers here. Drugs are the last of Boulder police worries. Be smart and it's a little slice of heaven.

9. This is just me but please please please clean up after yourself. It's insane to me how much trash deadheads left behind last year. Please just carry your trash to a trash bin and be mindful of the fact the Boulder has compost and recycling bins everywhere. It's easy to make the choice to be environmentally conscious. 

That being said, it's been dry as fucking hell here. If you are camping, there is a 100% fire ban in boulder county. PLEASE OBEY THIS. Last year we had two people from Alabama burn down a 1000 acres of Forrest because they did not heed the warning. This includes being mindful of cigarette smoking and weed smoking if you are in the woods. In reality, it's best to just not smoke if you are in the forrest. If you absolutely must then please make sure no embers survive. 

10. If you have any other questions I would be happy to answer them. I'm a Boulder resident of 5 years and know the area well. I'll be in a blue/purple 92 summer tour tie dye on Saturday that has a dancing lady on the front. If you see me then please say hello.

Apology To The DeadHead Community,"Hey guys. I know and fully expect to get a lot of hate for posting this, but it has to be done because, to be honest, I feel absolutely terrible and disgusted about what I did last night. I would like to first start off with an apology to anyone's night that I had ruined last night as it was me who reported to nugs.net the streams that were up on the discord. 

You might be wondering why I did this, which is reasonable to expect. Well, I am ashamed to admit that I have been starting to be filled with hate as my life circumstances have deteriorated to the point to where I fallen so far into darkness that it is hard for me to see any good in anything anymore. I have pushed both family and friends away from me to where I am in complete isolation at the moment and have been for years. To be honest, the only relief that I have ever had from these feelings had been when I listened to a Dead recording. This has just recently changed and I find that even that hasn't been helping me lately. I guess this manifested into hatred by seeing others having fun and experiencing joy that I so desperately want to feel again.

This filled me with an immense amount of jealousy and hatred as I felt, why do they get to have these things and not me? What have I done to deserve this? I wanted other people to feel like I did which is wrong and I am so very sorry. You have no idea the amount of shame I feel right now for what I did to the community and music that I love. It has helped me get through a lot of tough times. 

I don't expect anyone to forgive me, but I hope that maybe the community can understand that I really have no idea how I have fallen this far into darkness and I don't know how to get out of it. It is a very real and scary place that I reside in. Just hope people realize that this could happen to anyone and I hope it doesn't. I really do care for this community and love you guys, I just did a very shameful act born out of a darkness that I so desperately want to get out of. 

To show my remorse, I will give someone from the Discord a free 2 night stream that nugs.net gave me for this reporting as I do not feel right using it myself. If someone could get the word out to BrentsRolex I would like to give it to him, so he can give it to whomever he wishes. Thank you for reading, and again, I am very sorry guys. I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. I am truly disgusted in my behavior.",gratefuldead,1528252845,Apology2DeadHeads,74,0,True,2018-06-05

Questions about Grateful Dead video recordings,"I love watching old Dead shows on YouTube. Few questions that have popped into my head...

Were shows widely broadcast in the 80s and 90s? Obviously not via internet, but were they available for purchase as like PPV or anything?

How come the 90s seem to have the worst quality of video, compared to 70s and 80s?

Were shows filmed with the intention of vhs or other format releases? Or just because the dead were all about recording everything?",gratefuldead,1528315074,Dakkmd,15,1,True,2018-06-06
Recommended bands similar to Grateful Dead,"So, all the music I listen to pretty much has roots with either the Grateful Dead or The Band.

When I start digging for more jam bands I run into a lot of Umphrey's McGee and String Cheese Incident, and I've never really gotten into that style of jam band. I don't know how to explain it, but they don't seem to have the same feeling as Grateful Dead.

How I got into the Dead,"Just thought I’d share my story:

My close friend died of cancer during our sophomore year of high school. She had lent me her copy of American Beauty. I had noticed a Dead patch on her backpack the day I met her on a public bus when I was 14 or so, and figured she must be cool, though I didn’t know much about the Dead. I never listened to the CD. 

A few years later, my godfather showed up to make up for lost time and took me to
Best Buy to buy me some CDs as a gift. I bought, among a few other things, American Beauty in her honor. I ended up liking it well enough but never really listened closely.

On the night of Sept. 11, 2001, I was in my first year of college at Berkeley at a candlelight vigil when someone on stage played Brokedown Palace on his guitar for his brother who’d been in the towers. Only later did I realize it was on American Beauty. 

I later moved to San Francisco and got into the music history, especially Quicksilver Messenger Service and the Jefferson Airplane. I also picked up Anthem of the Sun. I remember listening to it on a sunny day driving though the rolling hills of Napa. It was beautiful. 

Then I moved to NJ and bought Europe 72, Dick’s Picks 4, and Stepping Out from the Princeton Record Exchange, in the order. Loved em, but that was enough for then. My acoustic duo also played Brokedown Palace and Brown-Eyed Women on a semi-regular basis, and I enjoyed fiddling around with Friend of the Devil solo.

Living in England after that, where they are less known didn’t help things, but I kept listening to what I had on occasion. I managed to hear the Woodstock set at some point as well.

Only during my second run through graduate school, after having spent most of my time listening to jazz, especially free jazz and fusion, and classical music, especially 20th-century stuff, did I really arrive at the wider world of the Dead. It’s been 3 years or so now since then, when I really “got it.” I have now heard hundreds of shows, and I’m currently doing the day-after SBD headphones tour this year with Dead and Company. 

I could not care less about the drug culture or the meaning of Jerry’s (or Pigpen’s, etc.) life, etc. I’ve never been to a show. To me, it’s not the lifestyle that makes the Dead. I wonder if I might actually be turned off by the whole thing. Not sure. Oh well. To me, the Dead are amazing artists, musicians, songwriters, improvisers, etc. I love the immediacy of it all.

For me, the Dead remind me of my life, different events along the way. They’ve been a very personal pursuit. It’s just been me and the Archive. Now that I’ve been on this community on reddit, I thought I’d share my story with others. 

Thanks for reading. Any thoughts? Similar stories?",gratefuldead,1528398677,johndbenjamin,27,14,True,2018-06-07

Over-the-top phone use during show...,"First, I'm super appreciative of the technology which makes couch tour possible and the real\-time updates of what's happening at any given show. As anyone who follows along audio/video streams can attest,  it's been an amazingly cool way of connecting w/ other heads and sharing the awesomeness of this music.

That written, I wanted to suggest some baseline rules of etiquette around cell phone use during a show. ANY show, actually...not just D&amp;C (but I guess I care less about Taylor Swift shows and think there would be no way of getting that particular audience aboard). Some of these issues were highlighted for me most recently during the Camden shows.

PHOTOS: If you want to take a photo at the show, you should feel free. There are some great backdrops and lighting effects that are worth capturing, if that's your thing. However,  people should take pictures with as little impact or obstruction to others in their area and that includes those both in front and behind you. Turning off your flash is the most obvious courtesy and something people should do before the show starts, if they plan to take pics. As much as reasonably possible, photos should be taken  quickly so you're not holding up a phone in someone's line of sight for a really extended amount of time.

VIDEO: Sigh...this is a tougher one but capturing an entire 18\-minute Dark Star on video while holding your phone up high above your head and obstructing a fellow head's real\-life view of the Dark Star is, at best, inconsiderate and at worst, downright frustrating for more than a few people. At least, that's my experience.  
As far as streaming goes, I'd personally like everyone, all over the world, to enjoy what the band is doing live but not at the expense of those at the show and certainly not for an extended amount of time. I'd suggest that if someone wants to take video and/or stream the show, they find a spot where they won't obstruct those around them. Even step into an aisle.

SCREEN BRIGHTNESS: Ok,  I'm feeling frustrated on this one because it's flashing me back to last Friday night and the kid in front of me. He must have had his phone brightness set on ""Alien Ship Lights from Close Encounters"". Seriously, it felt like a supernova in the middle of section 204  We're all part of a group at a show and while everyone is different, no one has the right to detract from the main event. 

TEXTING: I guess it's the same as above. I don't care who's texting, just be considerate and aware of others.

Man...re\-reading this, I think it sounds pretty anal but frankly, I don't like being the guy to ask someone to put their phone down or lower the radiation\-poisoning brightness of their screen. These seem like normal considerations to me and an appropriate way to see a show. Or I'm just old and will be yelling at kids to get off my lawn any day now.

"My first show, and I'm forever Grateful.","Just thought I'd add my story for those who are interested. 
I started listening to the Dead in middle school while I was experimenting with phsycadelic rock. Tried my best to get into it with moderate reults, until I stumbled upon the Dead's Americana side. During that time however, I never knew how much energy the Dead could harness in a live concert setting. I sort of lost interest until about a year ago when one of my teachers began recommending some of his favorite shows to me. This opened the door for me. I started branching out and listening to whatever piqued my interest on Archive.org and slowly began to steep myself in Dead lore. I thought of myself as a head, and felt that I had reached the apex of the experience. I was proved wrong last night ( Dead and Co. at Noblesville). I was a bit skeptical knowing that this wasn't quite the original Dead, but knew that it was the closest I would get to it. I wasn't able to partake or get lifted during the show, but I'd soon find out that I wouldn't need to. I learned what the saying ""There's nothing like a Grateful Dead concert"" meant, albeit Dead and Co. concert now. The heads that were there made me feel like I was family, like I was a dear friend who they simply hadn't become acquainted with yet. Everytime I got excited, a new face would look at me with a smile. By the time I had to go, (had to leave early for the 3 hour drive), I was almost moved to tears. I didn't want to leave what felt like my newfound group of friends. When I left I think everyone around me said ""goodnight"" in one way or another, and made sure to bid me farewell. Ever since last night I've been in the deepest, lowest of moods simply out of longing to be back there with them. With Bobby and the boys and everyone else like me who came to bask in the sweet sounds of their music. I felt like they, and everyone around, were trying to say ""Welcome Home"". I may only be able to experience this a couple more times due to the inability to travel, but I can say that I've truly been blessed. Thanks for reading, and thanks for caring.",gratefuldead,1528428710,YmirAld,7,12,True,2018-06-07

Help me with artwork?,"Hi folks,

I've got a couple of great sticker ideas, and a strong desire to make and share high quality stickers with others.  I have intermediate (previously advanced but it's been a few years) knowledge of the process, and I have a printer lined up, but only a little time before the Cascadia shows at the end of June.

Can you help with artwork?  I'm looking to either get someone to actually do the work, for which I'd pay, or to help line up resources.

I've got 2 main ideas: 1) I'm interested of riffing off of the D &amp; C circle with the bolt, with text around the top and bottom. and 2)  I'm thinking of riffing into Summer Tour artwork, with slightly different linework, colors, and wording.

I have basic photoshop skills, and I think I can get usage of it for a few at least a few hours - I hear there are steal your face templates out there?  Where should I start looking for a D &amp; C circle template, or a top quality version of the Summer Tour artwork?

Even if you could just help organize, what are the steps, how much time should I allow for the printer?  Do I need to be sure to get vinyl or waterproof, or crack-n-peel backing?  ETC.  I want to produce a quality product, as affordably as possible.

Thanks for any help, guidance, resources, or even great humor or links to super shows!

Dark Star Sunday - Volume II,"Last week we tackled two Studio versions of Dark Star -- the one that ended up as the single, and a lyric-less outtake.

Today we cover a big unanswered question: **When was the first live Dark Star?**

The answer is... we don't really know!

Here is what we do know -- Dark Star *probably* didn't make it's live debut until after it was recorded in the studio in November of 1967.

But before we get into the potential candidates, let's listen to a pre-November 1967 jam where we can pretty clearly hear the band touching upon themes that would soon become Dark Star - [09/03/1967 Dancin'](https://archive.org/details/gd67-09-03.sbd.backus.17272.sbeok.shnf/gd67-09-03d1t01.shn). Feel free to skip forward to about the 2:30 mark. Jerry spends several minutes playing around with the main Dark Star theme and chord changes. This is a must listen! Legend has it that Robert Hunter was at this show in Rio Nido and composed the lyrics while listening to this improvised jam. That may be a bit of revisionist history, but it's certainly a romantic image.

With that out of the way, we can turn to the first Dark Star. 

For a long time, many assumed it was 12/13/1967 at The Shrine Aud in Los Angeles. No recording circulates, but this was listed in various setlist databases. The current consensus among Dead historians seems to be that this show may never even have taken place (see [here](https://archive.org/post/338170/the-first-live-dark-star) for a discussion.

The first live *recording* we have for Dark Star comes from [1/17/1968](https://archive.org/details/gd1968-01-17.sbd.cotsman.11795.shnf/gd68-01-17d1t03.shn) at The Carousel Ballroom. The recording is clipped slightly at the beginning, but we otherwise get a complete and relatively straightforward edition, more or less true to the studio version recorded two months earlier.

So was this the first live Dark Star? Maybe! Was Dark Star played in a show in November or December of 1967 that doesn't have any tapes circulating? Also maybe!

If you ask me, it seems almost appropriate that a song that often seems to just musically ooze forth from the ether began it's life in a similar manner. ",gratefuldead,1528606058,BrianSnow,4,26,True,2018-06-10

Got lucky instead of busted...,"Story time. 

So, we were bringing a joint into the venue last night. 

My wife puts the joint in her cigarette pack, thinking security is less likely to search her than me. Sounds good to me. I am supremely blazed at this point - having just tailgated for several hours. 

We stand in line forever and then empty our pockets to get wanded by security. I notice that they are ALL being extremely thorough. Hence the ridiculous line. 

My wife goes first and gets wanded, then the security guard asks her to open her cigarette pack! He of course sees the joint and starts grilling her. “Is that a joint? You aren’t supposed to bring drugs in the venue” - all sorts of bullshit. She stays silent - just shrugging. I step in and say it’s mine. He then tells us to take it out and throw it away. We are freaking out (never been busted), and I am doing my best to dig this mini joint out of her cig pack. 

At this point, a man in a black D&amp;C button-up shirt appears out of nowhere and tells our guard- “Look at this line! You don’t have time to check every cigarette pack!.” Our guard is now pissed. 

I had finally got my finger on the joint in her cigarette pack and was about to pull it out and the guard slams the pack shut and tells us to go!! Joint still in pack! Holy shit!!

Our hearts almost exploded out of our chests we were so freaked out. That was a close fucking call!! ",gratefuldead,1528676229,johntangus,34,48,True,2018-06-10

Resellers are not real fans.,"Honestly, trying to make a buck by reselling posters, tickets, or merch is just not in the spirit of the Dead in my opinion. Saw a guy on ebay selling Raleigh posters for $165. $105 more than face. And he has 9 and sold 7 at that price already. Trying to make nearly $1,000 off of sold out posters is frustrating. Someone that may have truly wanted one to commemorate their evening may have missed out due to people like this. And while I am genuinely upset with people that do things like this, it also upsets me that the people running the merch booths allow this to happen. No one person should have any need for more than 2 posters, one for themselves and one for a friend unable to make it. Sorry for the rant guys, just had to get that off of my chest. In other news, loved the show last night and loved all of the great people I met on shakedown. Truly one of the best experiences of my life.

"Two days late, but a shout out to 5-7-78, Troy NY, especially the Scarlet--&gt;Fire...","I suspect the SBD for this show was in the tape collections of many heads in the early 80s, especially on the east coast. It was, for the time, pristine. I recall walking the lot at various shows (one specific memory of Hampton around 84 or so) with this show blasting out of the back of a station wagon - and yeah, memories.

I put it on for old time's sake two days ago - 40 years after the show itself - and was reminded how much I loved the whole thing.

The Scarlet-Fire remains a favorite for me, for a lot of reasons. It's tight, everyone present in the tune, Jerry belting out strong lyrics, and even Bob's slide guitar and Donna getting lost in her transition and coming into Fire too early has its charm. 

This Scarlet-Fire feels like the culmination of the previous year's great performances. For me, it's flawless, flaws and all. But my favorite moment is in Fire after Jerry's first solo, which is big and strong ... when suddenly the entire band backs away, take a breath, and comes back into an ultra funky, super tight, perfectly-meant-to-be Fire on the Mountain groove.

Everyone plays their part as it should be. I live for these moments over the thousands of hours of music and here is one.

[In this recording, the moment I am talking about comes at around 4:08 in Fire on the Mt](https://archive.org/details/gd78-05-07.sbd.vernon.8327.sbeok.shnf/gd78-05-07d2t02.shn) but start earlier so you can hear how Jerry drives everyone to the peak, and Bob's slides brings it home just at the right moment.

Nicest Member of the Group? Most Grounded?,"Kind of a weird subject, but I just read the post about the new Selvin book and it definitely sounds like it's going to paint Phil in a negative light. I've read some books such as McNally's and seen Long Strange Trip, and it seems like every key member was prones to bouts of asshole behavior. I was especially dismayed to read about how cold Jerry could be during the times of his addictions.

So, given all that's come out of over the years, I'm wondering who's generally considered the nicest of the group, or at least the most level headed \(I know, kind of two different things\). For years, I always got the vibe Mickey was the most down to earth and friendliest of all of them, but I actually asked a couple of older Deadheads their opinion on this, and I was surprised to find out they all thought Bobby was the nicest out of all of them.

Need Help Choosing A Show For A Gift,"Hey everybody, looking for show suggestions based on some loose criteria...


This past week I did some work on my car. At a certain point I got stuck. Luckily, I was able to borrow a tool I didn't have from a neighbor I don't know that well, but have always been very friendly with; and finished the job successfully. 

Long story short, when I was in the foyer/vestibule/whatever of his house as he fetched the tool, what do I see? A Skull and Roses album framed and hung on the wall of this living room.

When I return his property I'd like to present him with a burned CD of a show as a thank you. Now for the criteria: 

* Because I know he likes Skull and Roses, I figure a show from 1970 through 1973 would be good.
* Based on the large number of records he has, I wanna pick a show that's on the rarer side just in case he has a lot of official releases (so probably avoid Dick's Picks etc.) I was initially thinking about picking one of the Europe '72 shows, but I don't know how widely available those were when they were first released.
* And finally, if it's a show I'd be downloading from archive.org, I'd like it to be a soundboard or good matrix.

I hope my criteria aren't too restrictive. This sub never fails to impress me with its collective knowledge and creativity when it comes to suggestions. I have access to pretty much all official releases as well as a Grateful Grabber-enabled chrome browser, so fell free to fire away with all ideas. Thanks in advance everyone.

The Long Strange Trip was really sad.,"I just got around to watching it on Amazon Video this weekend (I know, super late to the party). What a sad documentary. It starts innocently and the first two installments are pretty lighthearted and fun when it was all LSD and pot, a tale of a bunch of goofball dudes who somehow managed to get a band going. And then the problems start.

Most of the doc is people talking about negative things. I mean, I'm not saying its all negative, but the deadhead section starts fun and ends dark. The Jerry stuff always has this grey cloud of sorrow over it when talking about the guy and his lifestyle beyond the early 70s. 

I am not saying this makes the documentary bad. It makes it far better than if it were all good no bad. It just it reminded me of how this whole thing will always be mired with with sadness and death. And in a way, that makes it more powerful, and you can find deeper meaning in it through this connection. Your hardships are made easier by their hardship and the sacrifice they, specifically Jerry, made to keep the Wheel turning for their families, friends, employees, and fans. The surface of the Grateful Dead is always smile smile smile. Jerry, to a layman, is just this jester king of the Dead who was all goof and hippie ideals. I agree with that one guy's assessment of Jerry, in that you really dont fully appreciate the guy and the music until you pay attention to the songs a bit more and realize most of them deal with loss, death, and sorrow. Then it starts to take on that deeper meaning.

It made me appreciate the band a little more, though. Also made me really glad that we still have Phil, Bobby, Mickey, and Billy. 

I will say I felt Vince, as always, got really shafted. No mention of the guy at all. Not even in a passing way when talking about Brent's death. I mean, the guy wasn't like an integral member or anything, but damn, not even an aknowledgement? The same could be said for T.C., but he was never, imo, a true member of the band, more of a bit more official filler spot like Bruce.",gratefuldead,1526310439,faster_than_sound,78,61,True,2018-05-14

5/14/1978 Providence Civic Center - Also referred to the show that started it all. 40 years ago tonight my father saw his first of 350 shows.,"Forty years ago, at around this time my grandmother drove my dad and his friends to their first Dead show. 

This date and show would eventually become one, if not THE most influential and contributing force into making me the person that I am today.
My fathers Grateful Dead influence on my brother and I are something I wouldn’t trade for the world. (You may remember my dad as the guy who flew from Boston to San Fran to play Jerry’s Tiger guitar as his best friend was personally repairing it for Jerry himself in the summer of ‘93. I’ll post those pictures later when I’m home.)

The Dead became more than just a hobby but a religion however cliche that sounds to my dad along with myself and many of you I imagine. This day, in 1978 was the dawn of a lifelong appreciation for a band that exceeded excellent musicianship and that spark has been passed on from generation to generation. 

The Dead have affected me in ways I never thought imaginable, they have brought me all over the  country on many occasions, Met tons of friends through the music. Picked up the guitar again when I really started to get into the dead as a teenager. 

To this day I’ll be seeing @Dead and Co. this month for the fifth time.  We miss you dearly Jerr, but Johnny Boy Mayer is one hell of a player and love him as a fit with the band. 
I am too young to imagine what following a band for 40 years seeing them close to 400 times would feel like. Going to college, getting married, having kids -The Band was still there, probably still playing the same song haha. I hope some day I can pass down the love for this music down to my kids just like my dad did to my brother and I. 
Here’s to another 40 long, strange years!

Dark Star: An Oral Biography of Jerry Garcia by Robert Greenfield
 
Weaving together close to 70 interviews with Jerry Garcia's wives, family, friends, fellow musicians, and other well-known figures in the Grateful Dead scene, Dark Star brings to life one of the most influential and enduring stars in American music. It sheds new light on Garcia's childhood in San Francisco, the formation of his musical identity, the Dead's road to rock stardom, and his final, crushing addiction to heroin.At once an evocative chronicle of Garcia's public and private journey and a fascinating look at why his music and his lifestyle had such a tremendous impact on so many, Dark Star is the full, behind-the-scenes story of the making of all icon, and the price of fame.",gratefuldead,1526469934,TheFigFiend,10,14,True,2018-05-16

so, hoping to avoid that, and conscious of all of the above- i want to get a ~tiny~ bit loopy (2 puffs or less). 

i’m not much of a stoner but just want to enhance the experience. will the crowd give me enough of a buzz? would bringing like half a weed gummy driving across the state be riding too dirty? will the lot be surveilled if i try to buy a joint? i won’t be drinking so no worries about a DUI.

Grateful Dead: Rainbow Full of Sound - Vol. 1-7,"If you have Spotify, you might want to take check out Grateful Dead: Rainbow Full of Sound - Vol. 1-7 (links at end of post) -- nearly 24 hours of face-melting, soul-stirring, heartwarming, ass-shaking, career-spanning groovy GD music. 

I compiled these playlists by scouring Spotify in the hopes of curating seven distinct ""fantasy shows"" that draw from every era. I did my best to structure the set lists according to what I consider 'appropriate' song placement (veering towards 80s-style set lists), but with the added obvious twist of being able to go from an '85 Cryptical into an Other One from '71, for example, or a Help&gt;Slip from '75 into an 80's Franklin's, etc. I also tried to throw a Pig and/or Brent tune into each first set. 

Head's up: Vol. 7 is a (jumbo) 2nd set only because I ran out of choice first set tunes and didn't want to start chopping songs from Vol. 1-6 just to cobble together a 1st set for Vol. 7!

As mentioned, each decade of the band's history is represented throughout each playlist, but fair warning to all of you completists: although there are 160 songs within the 7 volumes, some tunes didn't make the cut for a variety of reasons ranging from unavailability on Spotify (The Weight; Born Cross-Eyed) to personal dislike (I'm talking to you, Eternity) to me not wanting to jam yet another song into set lists that were already running pretty fat! 

If you see something missing, please don't cry foul in the comments section. This was a labor of love that I wanted to share, but it's not gonna float everyone's boat. Believe it if you need it, if you don't just pass it on!

Finally, I threw in some choice JGB ""filler"" into each playlist just because :)

Be warned, best to listen in sequence rather than sorting alphabetically!

Pigpen's final song?,"I was listening to thr Big Steve hour on Sirius dead channel the other day and was really moved by a story he told about the last day of Pigpen. He yalked about bringing his Hammond and a couple of leslies up this really steep driveway and that pig had wanted to play and practice and they all had dinner and hung out and that it was a day later he was found. Steve told the story with such fondness and emotion that i could still feel his love and pain even after all of these years.  I did some looking into pigpen and found a rolling stone article about his passing that mentioned finding a recording on the nightstand next to him when he was found.

If you gonna walk out that door,

I'll get back somehow
Maybe not tomorrow, but someday
I know someday I'll find someone
Who can ease my pain like you once done*

Ive never heard this but i was wondering if it was recorded that day, his last. Likely recorded on that hammond that big steve brought over. Maybe it was his farewell. Id love to hear it and im wondering if it was released or if it is bootlegged. Does anyone have this? Can they post for us all to celebrate him? By the way, if anyone missed that show,  id love to see a link to it also. Great music selection and incredible stories. He does such a great job spreading the gospel.

Special Music,"About a month ago I was walking home from high school after a not so great day. I was listening to a ""Complete Road Trips"" show that I had not heard in its entirety. What happened next is something that I am sure all of you will instantly relate to, but was relatively new to me. A minute of music so good that it sends chills down your spine and changes the track of your day. Amazing what this music can do. Great that I can share this experience with a likeminded community that gets it.

The track was ""Ship of Fools - Live at Boston Music Hall"" off of the ""Complete Road Trips"" compilation. The jam that starts at 3:25.

So Im a fairly young fan of the band, and one thing that I haven't able to ever get over, is the fact that I will never be able to enjoy these guys with Jerry's accompaniment.

Hope y'all have a great time at the shows this tour,"Unfortunately I'll be unable to go this year. I was slated to go to Citi Field but after getting into an argument with one of my ""friends"" (a very long story) the friend group promptly abandoned me and gave away my ticket. Really hurt right now because none of them love this band like I do on top of not having any local friends anymore. My dad is extremely kind and a total non-head and he offered to go with me but my heart's just not in it anymore. Their shitty actions just took the wind completely out of my sails and I have no interest in going. Now when I look at my hat and listen to the lads I just feel bitter.

I think it would be cool to talk about how you guys were introduced to the music, one of my favorite parts about the band is that their career spanned so much time that people have really different ""entry-points."" My cousin Eddie is a huge head and while I feel a little guilty that I haven't asked him this particular question before, I know he started following them around in the late 80's with his best friend Adam. They've told me some awesome stories, and hanging out with Eddie at Citi Field last year was a huge bonding experience for us. 

For me personally, I used to go to a summer camp where Eddie worked as the ""garage band"" guy. He taught me how to play bass when I was younger and had a much different taste in music than I do now. In 2014 I had my heart broken and was in a pretty dark place. Before then I'd heard of the Grateful Dead but didn't really pay them much mind or understand them that much. I was going through a lot of music as heartsick people do and they just struck me so hard. Before that I listened mainly to bands like Pink Floyd and Jethro Till who, while still amazing, largely made me want to kill myself lol. I think it was Music Never Stopped or something similar that, to me, just said ""Pick yourself up man, there's a whole lotta life to live."" During that summer I picked up guitar and me and Eddie would listen to the music, play it(albeit shittily), and he would teach me about the band through personal stories and books. What a magical fucking time, I really miss that. Eyes of the World will always be my favorite tune because of those times. Ever since I've been totally entranced by their music and hardly listen to much else. Bobby in particular continues to be my idol in terms of guitar, even though I adore Jerry. I just love the way he plays, especially in the 70's. Even though I'm nowhere near his level of chops yet I'd like to think that the way I play is mainly influenced by him. 

Tangentially, my two friends Marty and Sam who were and are far more accomplished musicians than myself would always sit outside the bunks with their guitars and play all sorts of stuff. A lot of the times when they were playing some really complicated shit I'd ask them what it was, and they would say ""John Mayer."" This was initially before 2014 so I just kinda wrote it off but acknowledged how complex and good it was. When JM teamed up to make D&amp;C it was like a puzzle piece fitting snuggly into place, I'm very happy that I was able to include Mayer and the Dead in my life in such a personal, serendipitous way.

Anyway, what about you guys? How did you find this music?",gratefuldead,1526868332,Plazma60,8,12,True,2018-05-20
Best Year of the Early 80s : 1981,"My journey to find the coolest Space sequence lead me to this year for one thing, and it was the Blues For Allah space on 10-6-81. This is honestly some of their more out there music especially for post 74. You also have the early May tour where they'd play Spanish Jam or Caution a lot, but at a breakneck lighting bolt speed. Plus, the auds are all very close to perfect, and capture the sound of the arena and music perfectly.

My favorite shows as of now are 

5/1/81 for Althea and the WRS &gt; Deal which is a really weird comvo
12-31-81 for DS &gt; Bertha alone
2-26-81 for a 22+ minute He's Gone &gt; Space &gt; Truckin &gt; Black Peter

Dead in the car.,"I tend to listen to Dead at home and on my phone mostly. 
Partly because their recordings were not studio quality and party because I don’t follow the music that much while driving.  Some bands more that others. 
In other words, some bands are easier to listen in the car than Dead let’s say.  To me to get the best of Jerry. You have to be into it all the way, otherwise it can sound off, while driving. 

What else do you guys play when driving.  

I love driving.   It I’m starting to run out of the material to fill the usb drive.  
I used to love Dire Straits. Doors. steely Dan.  
But I think I might have grown out of it.

Making an Introduction to the Grateful Dead tape for my girlfriend...any specific recommendations?,"I’ve been nonstop gushing to my girlfriend about how much I love this band and she’s curious about them.

Stop Sleeping on Papadosio!,"If what you love about the Grateful Dead is there ability to stretch their trusted and true material into truly esoteric and transcendental majestic pieces of psychedelic deliciousness then you CANNOT miss Papadosio. What they don't have is they folksy vibe of the dead, instead they've replaced that with a modern electronic approach. Just saw them again in Asheville, and was blown away again. They're kinda turning the Orange Peel in Asheville into their Fillmore, all their shows there seem to be insane. In an era where many of the 90s jambands are petering out a bit (SCI, Panic, etc.) and lots of the newer bands do something fun but not revolutionary  (Lotus, Twiddle, etc.) Papadosio is able to fill a gap that they dead left and Phish was never able to fill. That gap being the incredible range of emotion and righteous power that the dead were able to harness, which Dosio has in spades. Go check out their bandcamp or the shows they did at Red Rocks with Alex and Allison Grey on YouTube.

This will be the second of hopefully many **Throwback Thursday** streams where we get together as a group and watch a classic show! PM me with show suggestions for next week. 

I know most of the stuff I stream during off-season is available on demand at any time or is easy enough to find, but there's something special about getting together as a group chatting about and watching these old shows. Hope to see you tonight!

If you're unavailable to watch, but are able to listen the Twitch app has an audio only mode with background audio support. 

Twitch is available on most internet connected TVs and entertainment devices. ",gratefuldead,1523508787,mmmjams,5,18,True,2018-04-12

"""prototype"" versions of songs","I was listening to the ever-popular Watkins Glen jam of 7/27/73 for the first time and realized the end section is a primordial version of the song that would eventually become Fire On The Mountain. It really blew my mind hearing how similar it was to the quintessential FOTMs of '77 but at the same time very distinct in a fluid and free sort of way from its relatively  structured counterpart. It's definitely among my favorites now.

Hundred Year Hall (4/26/72),"Recently I haven't been able to put down Europe '72 Vol. 9 (4/26/72). Man, what a killer show!

The jams are fast and hard, and have some great late 60s / early 70s flavor to them. I can't stop listening to that 25+ minute Lovelight &gt; GDTRFB. Such a jam!

P.S. Is that Pigpen I hear on keys and vocals? I didn't think he was on this tour, but it sure sounds like his flavor in Good Lovin' and Lovelight. If so, I think this was my first Pigpen show I've listened to, and I'm definitely digging it.",gratefuldead,1523559745,TurkeyOnRy,10,2,True,2018-04-12

"Just had a cool ""strangers stopping strangers"" experience and have to share...","I woke up this morning and went outside to find that i had to go get a new tire for my car this morning. Not a great way to start the weekend! I was in a bummed mood about it. I drive to my local discount tire store wearing my Cats Under the Stars hat and am in the waiting area when I notice a guy wearing an ABB shirt.  Thought that was cool but he sees me and points at my hat, turns his around, and it's a Fare Thee Well hat! Ha! We chatted the rest of the time. I learned he and his wife have a baby on the way. We talked streaming shows and summer tour and the Bobby and Phil shows. We talked about how both of us in our mid thirties are living in a great time to be fans. I felt like we could have just kept on talking for a lot longer than the time we had. When my new tire was ready, we shook hands, I said ""maybe I'll see ya around some time"" and that was that. It made my day though. To be able to just strike up conversation with a stranger like we were friends put me in a much better mood. Thought I'd share and hopefully brighten up someone else's day.

Grateful Dead Book Club (session 1) Deal by Bill Kreutzmann,"This is the first discussion thread for a ""virtual"" book club about our favorite band.  A couple weeks ago I suggested this book and a number of you have said that you were up for discussing it.  I'll list a few possible discussion points below and jump off topics, but feel free to bring up any thoughts, criticisms, or questions you have about the book.

A few of my takeaways
- The history of Billy before the Dead.  Almost all biographies of the band cover the story of Jerry (and to a lesser extent Bobby and Phil) but the other guys just seem to show up at Magoo's Pizza in 1965.  It's interesting to get the background of another band member

- Billy's relationship with Mickey.  Often they are discussed as a single unit.  Most of the other time the discussion is about Mickey and his crazy instruments, world music, etc...  It is really interesting to read about how Mickey was integrated into the band.  Also the fact that Billy felt freed up after Mickey left the band and they played with one drummer.  The biggest reveal of the book was the resentment Billy felt when Mickey was thrust back into the band for the last show in 74 before the hiatus.  That was frank, and honest expression from Billy.  

-Discussion of drugs. I think this was the most honest discussion of drugs of any of the books on the band I have read.  Mickey seems to have the same thoughts/experiences that many of us have had.  Some drugs are good, others not so much, sometimes they were used too much, other times they were great.  He also didn't seem to sanctify LSD as much as some I have seen.  It was a great tool for the band and a whole hell of a lot of fun, but he didn't treat it like a sacrament or religious experience.  

- After the Dead.  This is the first book that gave anything more than glib treatment to the music they made after July 1995.  He didn't sound all that excited about many of the reunions up until the book was written.  However, the book was written before FTW and Dead and Co.  I wonder if he would write about it differently today.

Things to keep in mind while discussing the book
- When the book was written (and what has happened/changed since)
- Any agenda of the author (not necessarily negative, but is there something he wants to convey through the book)
- Any parts of the book that seem dubious or are contradicted by other books/interviews.  A lot of the history of the band is behind the haze of intoxication so there is bound to be inconsistencies.  Who and why do you favor one telling.

So have at it everyone.  Disagree and discuss, but be civil.  Not everyone has the same experience with the band or its bibliography, so give suggestions of further reading/listening if you can.

Finally how about some suggestions for another book to discuss in 2-3 weeks.  We will make that decision by the end of the week in this thread.

Have at it everyone.",gratefuldead,1523896153,Slpry_Pete,30,16,True,2018-04-16

Bill Frisell! THIS is Where the GD Shoulda Gone!,"Man I just found ""Guitar in the Space Age"" and a cut ""Tired of Waiting For You"" (old Kinks tune I think...?) just knocked me out! Here's a link but there's a LOT going on sonically! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPAiPDISp7U

To me I HATED space/drums. It was too self indulgent confused mess that only added up to annoyance that made ANYTHING they played next epic! Rarely did I hear one that had any sort of a theme, that went anywhere. 

BF just NAILS this idea with a few tunes but this one just sent me over the edge! He goes into a deep space jam but never loses the tune!

I swear if the Dead broke off one like this it would be an all timer! Remember how long we tripped on Eugene ""Close Encounters"" jam?

How cool would a Dead show with Bill Frisell be?!

A band like the Eagles - 10 years or so, right. But.....no.

Clothing Swap: my Liquid Blue long-sleeve for your awesome shirt,"A while ago, I bought [this tie dye](https://imgur.com/a/V0shS) from [Liquid Blue](https://liquidblue.com/music/rock-and-roll/grateful-dead/celtic-mandala-tie-dye-long-sleeve-t-shirt/).  I absolutely love the front and back images.  It was only available as a long-sleeve at the time, so I pounced on it.  I tried it on once and put it away (washed once in cold water w/ veggie oil-based detergent and hang-dried), thinking that it'd make its way into the rotation even though I most prefer short-sleeves.  The other day I was unboxing my tapestries and found this with them, begging to be worn.  Sadly, I'm not the one to wear it, as the long sleeves are a dealbreaker and it now fits a bit too snug for my liking.

I'm hoping someone out there is keen on making a clothing swap - my shirt for yours.

My caveat here is I'm not looking for any old shirt, but something that fits my tastes and wardrobe.  Short sleeves, more towards the GBIV end of the color spectrum, and per Liquid Blue's sizing chart, 2XL in size.  Graphic on the back is a must.  I'd make an exception on the sleeve length if you're offering a hockey jersey. :-)

If you've got something neat you'd like to trade, DM me or post some photos of what you've got and the measurements (not all clothing manufacturers make all sizes alike, plus stuff shrinks).

On Tape Hiss and Tape Pulls,"I was riding in my car today listening to the Charlie Miller remaster of 9/20/70 using the DeadHead Archive App on my phone, marveling at how easy it is for all of us to enjoy the best versions of this amazing music.  I've had multiple versions of this great show for decades, but many of them were hard to listen to, because of too much tape hiss.  Despite that, the power of the acoustic set always shined through.  While this version is still somewhat hissy, it sparkles in comparison to my old recordings.  Thank You Universe!

My memory was then jogged regarding a (thankfully uncommon) practice among a few ""elite"" tape traders in the 1970's and 80's of ensuring that their copies of certain concerts were superior to what was in the wild.  This was through a nasty practice of pulling the tape of the first gen copy while it was recording to add an intentional imperfection.  My first exposure to this was on the recording of Cortland 4/18/71 on what was an otherwise excellent SB.  The taper who made my copy apologized for something he had nothing to do with.

Grateful Discussions 29: Garcia album (not compliments).,"First discussion in a while I’m glad to be here again.

I was listening to one of the most mysterious songs in relation to Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead.

This album has a huge catalog of great staples: Bird Song, Sugaree, The Wheel, To lay me down, and Loser.

There’s an odd little place and there’s... well one of the weirder and more mysterious songs in relation this this odd family of musicians.

Eep Hour/late for supper/Spidergawd

I’ll call it spidergawd from now on. 


This song is creepy and one of the most psychedelic in nature. It genuinely evokes a sense of the complete unknown.

I genuinely feel like I’m tripping when I listen to it. The creepy spider part feels like the anxious come up. Then that sound that resembles snowfall and velvet feels like the peak.",gratefuldead,1524243796,Stratengar,4,5,True,2018-04-20

Terrapin Crossroads - transit options?,"So I'm going to be in SF for a couple weeks for a new job, staying in SoMa.  I've been refreshing the Terrapin Crossroads ticket page for weeks hoping to land a ticket to a Phil show while I'm out there, and I bit on the 4/24 Thunder and Lightning show.  On the plus side, the outward journey to TxR looks easy, as there's a bus that goes blocks from my hotel to walking distance of the venue, but the way back is a different matter;  it looks like it's either potentially leave the show early (which I really don't want to do) and catch a 11:20pm bus back or throw down for an Uber or Lyft.  I don't mind spending money on either one as I'm just happy to see the show, but I was wondering how reasonable it would be to find one out there that would go all the way back to SoMa, or if there are any other options that I haven't found yet, as I really don't want to rent a car if I can avoid doing so.

Tool fam here looking for the best way to introduce myself,"Hey everyone, I'm sure these posts come out all the time asking what the best way is to be introduced to the band. But, as a devoted Tool fan I find my musical interests to be highly fine-tuned and, frankly, picky as hell. I too enjoy the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Beach Boys, etc. but I know for a fact I'm missing out not listening to Grateful Dead.

That said, I'm really trying hard to delve into this music however I don't know where to start as there are just so many albums. I've given Anthem of the Sun and the eponymous album listens and so far I've enjoyed them immensely, but I feel as if I've hardly even scratched the surface and, honestly, I probably haven't even heard enough to form an image of the band. 

So, what is the best album, considering my musical preferences, to get into?

**from archive.org:**  
&gt; The sound on this one is amazing,
and the show is definitely an ""on"" night of some proportion. But whatever that guy's name is, he is not welcome on the ears, and if I'd been workin' there I'd have hooked him out to the alley and had a few quiet words about not stepping on the band's song before letting him back in. What an incredible drag! Dude, shut UP!!!  
  
and  
&gt; after listening to the matrix shows from oct 68 and the fillmore june 69 shows, My guess is the unknown singer must be Elvin Bishop  
  
and  
&gt; Elvin Bishop on harp too?
I knew right away that wasn't Pig playin' the harp during lovelight- wasn't bloozy enough. Sure enough you continue to hear the harp while Pig sings - so it makes me wonder, who was playin' it? Possibly Bishops harmonica player Paul Butterfield? Either way - hot Lovelight, great show- excellent sound. Easily a 5 star on quality.

&gt; Vince dont get enough credit. For the people who dont appreciate Vince go listen to 12/16/92 (Dicks Picks 27). He sounds just as good as Hornsby if not better on some songs and i think once Hornsby left the group Vince really had a chance to show what he could do. By that time he was way more familiar with the songs too. while Hornsby was in the band he took more of the lead keys role while Vince stayed in the back laying down more of a ryhthm keys sound. yes he did have some horrible sounds sometimes but i think it was also bob bralove messing with his key sounds alot. some of Vinces songs did suck i have to admit, Samba is not my favorite song in the world, its actually probably my least favorite, but he did do some great keyboard work while with the Dead.  
  
and  
&gt; This was my 1st Dead show!
I saw the Dead for the first time at the Capital Center at this show. A terrible venue from a sound standpoint. The Dead did an excellent job playing there adjusting their PA well. I did not know their catalog well and had to say this was a weird show since I did not know alot of the songs. I did like the Might Quinn as an encore. After seeing the Dead several more times and reviewing their shows, this set does not have the greatest selection but it's quirky. It was a Sunday afternoon and I'm glad my buddy called me to go see the Dead!  
  
and  
&gt; Well played show! The set list is great. The boys played with energy and Bruce is fantasic. The mix is well done and you can hear everyone. Enjoy!

Bobby/Phil Boston Night 1 was a mess,"Not sure if parachuting in guests to play one set with limited or no rehearsal time is just arrogance or a bad idea.

The song selection (and order) was weak. Loose Lucy (not a personal favorite) lead off and while I don't care for it does get ppl dancing. Masterpiece was really nice. Other first set songs were decent except for Althea. That was not good. Also the NYC Bird Song was much better and I'm not a fan of He's Gone into a set break.

Set break was over an hour last night. Did Bobby fall asleep? I get it we're lucky they're playing at all but come on take a nap before the show.

Second set was where the show just veered into the ditch. 

Guests:
Larry was fine but Larry is always fine. A real pro and doesn't need to stand in the spotlight. 

Teresa added about nothing and it really wasn't her fault. It's hard to harmonize when you can't find the key the other guys are not singing in. 

I was hyped when they came out with Crazy Fingers but it just sort of petered out in a pedestrian fashion. Nice to add a new cover (The Maker) and Other One and Music were highlights. Let us never speak of that Touch encore again.

Not the worst Dead related show ever but it wasn't that good either.

Rider&gt;Morning Dew?,"Did the band ever play any shows where they either segued from I Know You Rider into Morning Dew (I’d also be interested to know if they did it the other way around as Morning Dew&gt;Rider, but they settled into China&gt;Rider so early on it seemed unlikely) or teased one while playing the other? The two songs have close to identical chord structures:

I Know You Rider

&gt;I (D) Know You Rider gonna (C) miss me (G) when I’m (D) gone.
I (D) Know You Rider gonna (C) miss me (G) when I’m (D) gone.
Gonna (F) miss your (C) baby from (F) rolling (C) in (G) your (D) arms.

Morning Dew

&gt;(D) Walk me out in the (C) morning (G) dew my (D) honey.
(D) Walk me out in the (C) morning (G) dew (D) today.
(F) I can’t walk you out in the (C) morning (Em)  dew my (D) honey.
(F) Can’t walk you out in the (C) morning (Em) dew (D) today.

The last line is slightly different and Morning Dew plays it twice, but they are otherwise very similar. Seems to me like it might be the kind of thing they might have tried playing with at some point.",gratefuldead,1520569642,theotherone723,14,8,True,2018-03-08

&gt; Excellent early Brent-era surprise
A really solid performance right from the first notes of FLAS onward (except maybe the US Blues closer which keeps threatening to derail). 5 star second set for sure. No props for the Estimated yet? I'll be the first. 
The reviewer below is right, this show truly is one of the 'nest' of 81.

&gt; I rarely venture into the 80's, let alone the 90's, let alone 1992, but this is a great performance. The big second set jam is very, very cool. I don't care what people say, I like Victim or the Crime (and again, I'm not really an 80's+90's guy), though the real fun starts with Corrina (I pass on 90% of most Iko's). Again, no matter the 90's bashers or Bobby bashers, this Corrina is amazing. The outro jam is long and hot, stunning playing for 1992. Then there's the Dark Star/drums/space/jam with the Shenandoah theme and all that. That pretty much speaks for itself. So yeah, this one definitely gets the stamp of approval from a very non-90's guy.

&gt; The sound quality is great especially for a place a lot of ppl hate on for the poor acoustics/audio. In the description first set is missing Broken Arrow, Row Jimmy, Eternity, and Liberty. Broken Arrow is one of my favorite Phil songs and this version does not disappoint. I like the placement of Sugar Mag (second set closer) but not the most exciting version. I will add I am jealous of the folks that were there.

&gt; Unique ending to Scarlet Fire and Great show!!!
I have liked this show for a long time. I like this version the best. I listened to it today for the first time in about 8 years. So many shows to listen to...anyway- the highlights are the half step franklins- terrific noodlng by Garcia and the lazy light supplication is very spacy and well done. Jerry is 'on' tonight is what it comes down to. The scarlet fire ends with the lack of the coda jam at the end and instead has a twilighting sort of 'about to play comes a time or saint stephen' sort of sound...but alas they dip into a very well played sailor saint. I LOVE this show! Its in my top 25 all time now doubt- infact to contest this notion is to practically admit a lack of grateful dead bootleg knowledge...hahahah!JK I think its great! The Brown eyed is no slouch either! Crank it homey!Great quality. A not A plus but A quality. 7-13-84 is an Aplus board here...ummkaaaay...  
  
and  
&gt;  One pane of glass in the window..
Very good sound on this..thanx again Mr. Miller..I've been digging through 79'-81 and I've come across some interesting stuff..Brent finds his way through these years and by 82' you can hear how he becomes an integral part of the band..The Grateful Dead were at home in NYC and you feel and hear it in their playing..Think of all the HOT shows played in NYC...right..here is another example of the engine hitting on all cylinders..I love the song selection and the energy that emits from this show..so please..GIVE IT A WHIRL!!! Forever Grateful&gt;Forever Dead

&gt; Criminally Underrated Show!
This is an excellent show from '85 that unfortunately is often overlooked. The second, and best, show of a four night run in Berkeley. The boys are full of energy from start to finish and this show features an amazing second set.
Set one starts of strong with a lengthy, energetic Stranger. Jerry slows things down a bit with Peggy-O but his playing is very enthusiastic. C.C. Rider is next and it is a blazing hot rendition with amazing solos. Bird Song is another highlight. The vocals are surprisingly good and the jam features some great group interplay and lofty soloing. Bucket and Big Railroad Blues close out this excellent, hot set.
The energy level is amped up even more for the second set. Samson is soaring with fiery leads from Garcia and strong vocals. Terrapin features an extended jam and flows into a tight energetic Truckin. This segues into a nice reading of Smokestack Lightning that leads into an extended pre Drums jam which is one of the high point of the night. The Stella Blue that comes out of Space is beautiful featuring soulful singing and playing from Jerry. One of the better late period versions of this song. Surprisingly, another Jerry tune, Goin' Down the Road, follows and this was is bursting with energy. Everyone seems into it and Jerry plays some blistering leads. Bobby closes out the show with two short but blazing rockers.

&gt; Great remaster of a good show
Thanks for the upgrade!
Really some of these Spring 93' shows have a tight and assured performance value. They might not be taking as many chances as the late 80s but the entire tour sounds better to me than most of the 1992 performance year. 
The first set sounds magnificent. Stranger is just as good as ever with Jer completely present for a shredtastic solo starting things off right. Stager is tight as is Peggy O, which really has a unique sounding solo with the dark envelope effect that Jerry uses. Queen Jane, usually a ""filler"" song imho really takes off at this Rosemont show. Let it Grow is always a killer way to end a set and here is no exception. Really Jer is present for the entire first set.
Second set is great too, MLB Jam is a special treat. The REAL taint is the plodding Corrina, which i don't mind occasionally but here as the center jam of second set is really a snoozer. Especially after Way to Go Home and Lazy River Road, maybe could have used a classic jammer to bring this show into full fruition. But nope, we get Corrina. 
I'm not a 90s basher. I love this whole March month of shows. Dean Smith shows and the Cap Center breakouts are all classics. 
Solid 4 stars for what could have been 5....

"I'm sitting here watching Bobby and Phil from Radio City Music Hall 3-3-2018,","and it struck me just how very good these two are. What one could say is that you have the rhythm section of a band. But what you really have a lot more than that, as they meander between the rhythm and the melody, covering the whole spectrum of sounds from the extremely low end of Phil's bass to the very high end of Bobby's guitar.

But the style and techniques on display are extraordinary from Bobby's arpeggios and single string picked notes merging perfectly with Phil's contrapuntal lines filling up the whole space. This isn't just two musicians playing a gig. These are two guys who understand how music is put together to really reach out and touch the audience physically, spiritually and in every other way possible.

I am just in awe.

Jerry met me in my dream to wish me luck on my sat.,[deleted],gratefuldead,1520742585,[deleted],0,1,True,2018-03-10
I met Jerry in my dream last night and he helped me on my SAT,"I took my SAT today, and last night I went to bed pretty nervous and anxious for it. 

I dreamed that I was walking down the road and suddenly Jerry was walking next to me. We kinda just walked together for a while and I think he told me to not step in poo or broken glass. 

I don’t remember exactly what he said to me, but I just remember him laughing and smiling a lot and it helped me relax and not be worried about the SAT. 

Although the test was hard, I felt a sense of confidence and acceptance that everything would work out. 

Thanks Jerry 🙏",gratefuldead,1520742677,jeffray123,5,29,True,2018-03-10

Robert C Hunter,"So Robert C Hunter, according to Wikipedia, was part of a CIA mind control experiment in the 60s using psychedelics? The excitement was also known as MK Ultra... I understand this is on Wikipedia and I’m trying not to let my conspiracy side show but I was wondering if there was any knowledge of this with the GD community? The guy is credited for writing every song that Jerry is credited on too and he’s known as the most famous non-performing member of a band ever. 

Just looking for a little feedback / further explanation of this. My girlfriend asked me who Robert C Hunter was and I told her what I knew about him as a songwriter and told her to google him. Next thing I knew she was reading a section in his biography about being CIA experiment test subject. Just seems weird.

We were very thankful that they knew they were in the wrong. Why the fuck are people talking during Days Between???? Are you going to these shows to drink and socialize and to have this music just in the background for you? Do you talk when you're playing old shows off archive as well? Insane!!!

A Request to Boomers...or anyone,"Hey all,

So I’m a younger Head and I’ve had the privilege of seeing various Grateful Dead reincarnations over the past few years. No, I never saw Jerry - mainly due to the genetic lottery and the millions of years of humanity that brought my birth to a later year.  That being said, it seems like almost every show I’ve attended has been slightly dampened by Baby Boomer Dead Heads not being respectful at shows. Here are a few things I’ve noticed over the past years that Baby Boomers seem to gravitate towards at shows outside of their younger counterparts. Not saying all Boomers do this, and not saying younger folks don’t as well, but it’s been my experience:

1) Phones at shows: this first thing you’d think would come from those damn Millennials, yet  I notice far more older folks texting during the shows (SLOWLY, with one finger), looking at voicemails, taking photos WITH YOUR FLASH ON (take photos, but for God’s sake turn off your flash - flash in a dark arena pointed at a lit stage 30 yards away doesn’t look good - no need). I understand that emergencies happen, but unless what you’re doing on your phone is an emergency, put the phone away. If you’re going to have your phone out, turn down the brightness and turn off the flash!!

2) Inebriation: this can really just be pointed out to people in general, but I’ve noticed a complete lack of self awareness on the part of the older crowd. Getting shit faced drunk at shows and falling over your neighbors is just plain disrespectful to the fans and the band. At the recent Bobby and Phil show, I stood next to an older couple, and the woman literally spilled three cocktails on me before I asked her to relax. They left their seats and went to the bar at least four times during each set and smelled like the back of a limo. They couldn’t even stand by the end of the show. Please, be respectful. 

3) Talking...loudly: sure, all of us at some point during a show turns to our partners next to us and says something along the lines of, “holy shit, did you just hear that?!”, and that’s perfectly fine. What’s not fine is having an entire conversation for two full songs, while being completely unaware that you are shouting. YOU’RE AT A CONCERT! IT’S LOUD! THAT DOESN’T MEAN YOU SHOULD SHOUT OVER THE MUSIC! Any conversation you need to have can wait until set break. It’s really hard to tune out an entire conversation taking place around you-I’ve really tried and it just doesn’t make the show better for people around you!

Sorry for the long rant. This weekend in Chicago was full of beautiful music and memories that will last a lifetime, but if you’ve been lucky enough to have more of these memories than other people around you, don’t put a damper on their evening. This really applies to anyone of any age. I told my wife that I treat concerts the same way I treat being at the movies. Everyone is there to see the show. Put away the cell phone, keep talking to a minimum and be respectful of people around you!

Round 1 - THE 2nd Annual Grateful Dead Bracket,"Round 1 \- Field of 64! \(Ends 3/16//2017 @ 11:59 PM EST\) [https://goo.gl/forms/9eUdAec0wvP9gs2J2](https://goo.gl/forms/9eUdAec0wvP9gs2J2)

[Link ](http://gratefulmadness.com) to the bracket, rules, archive links, etc: [gratefulmadness.com](http://gratefulmadness.com)

Overview: Back for a second year in a row, this time we’re doing the TOP SHOWS OF ALL TIME will be seeded in a field of 64.  What shows makes you weep, what song makes you dance, and ultimately, what show makes you get up out of your chair and sing. Please listen to the archives before voting!

Couple things:

1. There are soooo many great/legendary Grateful Dead shows out of the 2,317, this is not meant for an argument. Comments are welcome \(of course, we’re on Reddit\), but the bracket won't change.
2. The seeds have been selected by a consensus. Communication went out to 145 deadheads asking for a list of what they thought were their top 100 GD shows of all time. This tasks was not for the faint of heart. 76 dedicated souls responded with their list, 69 men and 7 women. Of the respondents, the elder statesmen saw their first show in 1968, the youngest pup \(in deadhead years\) wasn't even born to see Jerry\(but is a rabid deadhead nonetheless\), everyone else fell in between \(the average saw their 1st show spring 1984\).
3. Each round will consist be a few days long and will fall inline with what the NCAA brackets schedules are.
4. Please dont vote twice :\)
5. Maybe this will open you to a new show you never heard before or take you back to a show you forgot about.
6. This is meant to be fun

HUGE SHOUTOUT to Mark \([u/RippleAffect](/user/RippleAffect)\) and all his loyal deadhead friends for the help with the seeds, brackets, and everything else

Again, here is the [link ](http://gratefulmadness.com)for the bracket as well the internet archives and the seeds.

Phil and Bobby Chicago Night 1,"A little late to posting, but just want to express how awesome that night was. Me and a buddy drove from out of town for it. The Chicago Theater is beautiful. That sign outside was simply amazing. The set list was amazing, and I was hyped from the beginning Box of Rain. The crowd so audible during Ramble on Rose gave me goosebumps. That West LA Fadeaway was particularly soulful.  I was thrilled that Jeff came on for the second set. 

Everyone at the show was also just awesome. At intermission I hit the merch line and had a good talk with an older Head.  He showed me some pictures of his daughter meeting Phil somewhere and how happy he was about being at the show. I went downstairs to roll my poster up in a tube and some guy saw I was clearly struggling. He ended up helping me out and rolling it for me which was a super nice gesture. Some woman in my row accidentally kicked over my full beer. And even after telling her countless times not to worry and that I didn’t mind, she left at some point to buy me a new one. 

The crowd was great, and this community is very reflective of the spirit of the Grateful Dead, just like at that show. 

It was truly an awesome experience for me and a night I’ll never forget. ",gratefuldead,1520906164,HMOSU23,4,18,True,2018-03-12

"Well, I am officially convinced....","A little backround, I'm now 20 years old, and for the past 4-5 years I've pretty much listened to mainly rap and newer edm type music. For the past year, I've been getting more and more into 60-70s classic rock music. It's probably 70% of what I listen to nowadays.

Well anyways, two days ago I took two tabs of LSD with a buddy (my 8th time tripping) who also loves that era of music. A month or two prior to this trip, I was just starting to get into the Dead. The music was awesome to listen to, but something just didn't ""click"" and I could only listen to the Grateful Dead for like 30 minutes at a time. Well during the peak of this trip, me and my buddy wanted to change the Pink Floyd we had been jamming to, and I recommended the Grateful Dead. I had heard that the Veneta '72 show was one of the best, so we looked it up on spotify and let it play. 

Man, I don't think I have ever been so fully immersed in an album start to finish. We sat there for 3 straight hours listening to the Dead fill our brains with hypnotic beautiful psychedelic jams. I very rarely listen to 3 hour albums all the way through, but when it was over I found myself wishing for more. It was simply amazing how all of the instruments and sounds came together to form a beautiful song. 

Now I literally can't stop listening to full live albums from the Dead. Each show sounds a little bit different and has its own unique sound to it. I am officially convinced the Grateful Dead is some of the most unique and amazing music ever created.",gratefuldead,1520908766,drugsthrowaway69260,85,93,True,2018-03-12

Bobby has always loved the cowboy tunes,"and he has gotten a fair amount shit for it , but I’m a fan. 
Another one of those El Paso out of Dark Star moments (Veneta) is in Seattle in June 73, when Weir breaks into Me &amp; Bobby McGee smack in the middle of  super jazzy super psychedelic Other One, then back to a double melting Other One.
And the rest of the band is all in. Electric. And Bobby’s voice, suddenly in the middle of that otherworldly jam, delivers the tune so perfectly.

I’ve heard/read the idea that this flowing from psychedelic to straight up country and back was done by the band to anchor everyone - band and audience - in otherwise interstellar chaos, and I buy that.

But also it was just cause Bobby loves cowboy tunes. Always has.

Blue Mountain is a great album.

Got done with duck inventory yesterday and just couldn’t stop thinking about Bobby these days.,"I understand that there are a whole slough of opinions on the most recent endeavors of Bobby, but I would hope that one thing we can all agree on is the power of his performance these last couple months.

Seriously, this whole Fall tour wrap up, especially the last three shows, and the plunge he and Phil took on their duo tour has truly brought out the best in the man. Listening over his playing and singing has made me grateful to witness, what appears to me, a serious surge of passion and creativity within him. 

That’s all. I just really wanted to express that opinion. Life of a solo Head. ",gratefuldead,1520952205,Jonafat,10,16,True,2018-03-13

&gt; Greetings all, I recall driving up to Utica for this one with Johny V , Flato and Doug's brother. Only Johnny had a ticket. I was fortunate to get one at the top of the off ramp, where we were giving other fans directions to the show. Shakedown street was an appropriate opener. It was melee outside the place. Lots of fans, not tickets. At one point, someone busted the glass windows surrounding the arena, letting a stream of people in. Once inside, I ran into a bunch of friends from Oneonta, had a great time. Leaving the show, Johnny and I could not find our ride. We ended up speaking to a guy named Mark on the way to a motel. Mark was from U of Vermont.. Ended up sharing the room with him that night and staying friends for years to come. A ride to Hartford the next morning was not a problem at all...  
  
and  
&gt; There is nothing like a Friday the 13th! Well there we were and here we are!! It was a crazy night with the boys! I had the lucky opportunity to feel the grasp of ""Big Steve's"" hand during this one. Yes it is no wonder that he is a ""psychologist"" Nice strong man that always made Garcia safe. Great show!! Nice languid Shakedown opens!!! Remember only do one not two!! Flashed back on this one a couple of weeks ago!! Furthur!!! It is a great example of the time.

&gt; If you like your Jerry solos a little more up tempo this is the tape to get. Not the best quality but like a lot of early '80's shows there are not too many SBDs available so this is probably all we have to go by. This is some of the quickest Jerry I have ever heard. Especially on the Stranger&gt;Franklins. Also a couple teases not mentioned on the list: He's Gone before Eyes and Dear Prudence before Black Peter.  
  
and  
&gt; Holy Smoke!
I thought I'd trawled out all the hot '82 - but I just heard the Stranger -&gt; Franklin's, and I'm stunned! Stranger takes a bit to get going, but the final jam is sizzling and weird, and the Franklin's Tower is totally over the top! The tunes is taken at a very fast clip, and Jerry goes absolutely bananas and the second and third jams - seriously, worth the price of the show, if not the whole tour. Get it! A good sounding Aud too, very sparkly, tons of highs, if a bit thin down low.

&gt; The final show of this four night run gets of to a blistering start with a rip roaring Jack Straw featuring some lighting leads from Garcia. Decent harmonies throughout. What a great start! Jerry slows things down a bit with Althea. His vocal performance is pretty brutal here with craggy vocals and lots of lyric flubs but his playing is still very enthusiastic. Bob's cowboy duo of Mama Tried&gt;Mexicali is often a throw away but this version is hoe with some slick soloing and some nice accompaniment by Brent, especially during Mexicali. It also features an extended jam that pumps the energy backup after the lackluster Althea. Jerry slows things down yet again with Friend of the Devil but unlike Althea this is sweetly played with respectable vocals Brent does some nice work and Bob even takes a short solo before Jerry rips out a great one. Minglewood is next and it takes Jerry a minute to join in but when he dos the pace picks up. There is some nice jamming including a short call and response between Jerry and Matthew Kelly on harp. Again, Brent's presence is felt wit a great solo. Deal is a high energy set closer with amazing soloing by Garcia. Kelly's harp however seems out of place. 
The high energy continues through most of the second set with great versions of some classics. The Music&gt;Franklin's that opens the set features some great group improvisation and soloing by Garcia. The transition is seamless but Jerry flubs some of the lyrics in Franklin's. The jams are extended and this duo is not to be missed. Estimated is next and it is he highlight of the show. Bobby sings with passion and both jams are incredible. Jerry delivers a scorching wah wah solo and the end jam is very soulful before segueing into the bluesy Spoonful. Drums is interesting because it features Hamza El Din yet the post Space jam is a bit uninspired. It seems like they ran out of gas and the remaining tunes are average at best. The Brokedown Palace encore is a sweet finish to a mostly great show.

&gt; Hey, all Dead shows are worth listening to
I was at this one and the night before and it's striking how mellow and kind of on the lackluster side they are in this anything but mellow, New Yawk hockey rink. However, Phil's side, right next to the speakers this second night, they didn't seem nearly as mellow as the night before. Don't let the date deceive you. This was a cold March in the northeast. Birdsong is a good one, worthy of its position in the set. WTGH doesn't disgrace the opener either, but we all know what became of that warhorse. Wave to the Wind really isn't played that poorly; it was really hard to follow at the time but they had it together by this point in the tour. I also felt it lent itself well to a transition into Drums. Some of the lyrics tho...Eesh. Pre-drums is a little blah but post Drums is pretty solid and focused as if they were just starting to wake up. The night before, I want to mention, has a spareness rare for a two keyboard show. This one is a little less so but it also portends how the band settles into a real mellow space with a sparse arrangements for the next several months.",gratefuldead,1520956958,revjurneyman,2,8,True,2018-03-13
Today of the Dead- 3/13/93 (Blizzard of 93),"25 years ago the parking attendant at the Richfield Coliseum bellowed, “Tonight’s show has been canceled!!!” After driving 8 hours from NC to the suburbs of Cleveland in the Blizzard the day before. We were denied at the gate, spent that night and much of the next day in the “Holidome” Holiday Inn that had an indoor courtyard with pool and abutting room patios. The Lot  aka Shakedown essentially moved indoors and the next night 03/14/1993 brought one of more divisive latter day encore debuts of “I Fought the Law.” The show was nothing in comparison to the last night in Chicago with Ken Nordine. But, the adventure of Spring Tour 93  was a challenging adventure that wouldn’t feel much like spring until it headed south to the Dean Dome in Chapel Hill, NC. Please post pics and reflections of the Spring Tour of 1993.

I just discovered the song Lay Back Baby by Merl Saunders and Melvin Seals from the ""Live on Tour"" Album. Very good song, surprisingly could not find any information on the internet about the song. I couldn't find lyrics or chords as I'm trying to learn the song on guitar 🎸.

Any musicians out there wanna give it a listen and tell me what you think. Even if you can't gather chords it would be a good song to discuss. So far I've heard: Bb, Eb, and F? Please listen for scales too. I think it's jazz theory because they play with the changes. Thanks for any input. It can be found on Spotify as well as YouTube.

The sound quality on this is exceptional. Hard to handle does have some distortion and little funkiness in the channels but so what - this performance by pig is primal caveman energy at it's finest, this is a hot show and wonderful find. Let's not nitpick here it was not that long ago we were listining to 55th gen maxells with dolby.  
  
and  
&gt; Underrated show!
Though the song probably peaked in April, this Good Lovin is an absolute monster performance; insane energy with Jerry and Phil carrying the jam to some mesmerizing heights. Killer version of Hard to Handle, especially the second half of the jam (after the tape cut) which really takes off, Jerry and Phil again going at it hard. Great stuff, and a seemingly overlooked show compared to some of the surrounding concerts.

&gt; Perhaps THE best, most sterling argument on the AUD side of the debate, especially for this era - this one brings it through crystal-clear - my god, it really does sound like a board, even though you know it isn't...
I'm tempted to go with a 4 on this one, but who am I to spoil the 5-star party? I know many here are bowled over by the quality, maybe to the point that the show is overrated just..a..tad? I mean, it's great, yeah, consistent, with that nimble, lighter-than-air '81 quality that defined so many shows, especially from the winter tour leading up to Europe. Everything is played exceptionally well, it's just that.....that....ah hell, I don't know. *shrugs* I guess maybe a show that seeks to use Sailor &gt; Saint as its pre-drums core could be accused of being a lightweight....even though they play it well enough...ah, forget it.
Post-Space is where you want to be - yes, Jerry teases Jesu and then launches into an absolutely pin-drop-gorgeous Stella Blue. The Bertha that screams into existence here is also pretty unbelievable - listen to how f'ing HARD they drive that mother!

&gt; The Holy Grail...
...a thirty minute 'Brother Esau'! An absolute must-have for all 'Esau' fans. Now removing tongue from cheek. I was never a fan of rehearsal recordings but these early '83 sessions are a lot of fun. The recording is real nice and clean and spacious, and everyone can be heard clearly. The different takes of 'Help' and 'Slipknot' are quite interesting because you can hear the band re-learning the tunes as they go, remembering little licks and tricks from six years prior. Phil is *extremely* into this session, you can tell he's been wanting to get this tune back into heavy rotation for a while, and he's finally gotten some cooperation. He is all over the place and it's a joy to hear. The 'Esau' is also fascinating, you can hear Weir calling out the changes as the track progresses, and you can hear them get a little more 'together' as the minutes pass. A very worthwhile session for those that are interested.  
  
and  
&gt; Great fun!
Wonderful for fans of the period! The Otis convo on track 14 is hilarious, and the epic Esau workout features totally different lyrics.

&gt; Superlative run
These were about shows 10-12 for me going back to July 1987. Simply stated this Cap Centre stint was the best run of shows I ever witnessed of any band, anywhere, anytime. The weather was uncharacteristically warm in the high 70's and low 80's and the vibe inside was almost maniacally intense. The band, thankfully, was even more intense and even with the mercilessly high expectations of the fans, the band was just killin' and just blew away even the most critical Deadhead. Each night, the sound from the far side of the arena just a few rows off the floor was the best concert sound I've ever heard. It felt like you could stick out your tongue and lick it. After a very fortunate lifetime of seeing over 1,000 concerts of all stripes this run is at the peak of them all. One of my friends, reflecting on these three nights described them as ""splatter"". Oddly, I knew what he meant. Get 'em all and enjoy another fabulous peak (along with '69, '72, '74, '77, and '81) in the storied and legendary career of the greatest live act that ever played on the face of this here planet. Happy trails.  
  
and  
&gt; I must say that even though I tend to prefer the earlier days of the band, this show does boil over with energy. Love the way the crowd erupts with first verse of Loose Lucy. Great show, excellent Matrix mix, who could ask for anything more! 5 Stars for this one.

&gt; The scene at the Holiday Inn I believe was really crazy, it was the one right off the Akron exit. If my memory is correct this was supposed to be a two day show but the snow caused the first night to be cancelled. I think this was the blizzard of 93 for us ohioans. Up to 3 feet of snow. I remember it took 7 hours to get from Marietta Oh to Akron because we were driving in bad snow. We got to the hotel just as they closed all the roads. When we got to the hotel we already had a room, thank God. There were so many stranded people there. We had like 10 people in our room. The hotel smelled really funky too :). People were all over the hotel and I think the management was like oh well because the roads were closed and no one had anywhere to go. The first night was cancelled and luckily I had tickets to the 2nd night but a lot of people were bummin. I remember the day of the show we met this poor guy whose car broke down on the highway. We tried really hard to help him fix his car in the snow and freezing cold. You know, do anything to help a brother. We had to push his car with ours off of the highway and left it in town, it was a blue volkswagon. The guy really appreciated us trying to help and he turned us on to a really good time. Thanks man. We made it to the show just in time to hang out in the parking lot for about an hour then it was concert time. I think they were having sound issues or our seats were so high up. The concert sounded muffled. I dont remember much past that except the lights and people everywhere. I hope that poor guy made it home alright. A shout out to all my frinds from then...Mikey, Joe, Ashu, and the poor guy with the broke down car. Miss you guys. Show was average and I remember a lot of people complaining about it. I had a good time. The Dead are people to and they must have been having an off night, it happens. I still love them for what they do and showing me the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right.

&gt; Snowstorm Inspires Heaven on Earth
I feel so lucky to have gotten seats to this show after being closed out of the previous night, which was cancelled due to the snowstorm. I bet my friend that they would open with CR&amp;S because of it. Who knows if that was the exact reason they did, but you could tell the band was committed to putting on an A-1 performance due to the circumstances. A local radio station also broadcast it live as a concession to the fans who missed out. Jerry's vocal on ""Touch of Grey"" was among the strongest I ever heard, almost like thanking the heavens, while proclaiming ""I will Survive!""

Seeking thoughtful conversation on Grateful Dead/Dead &amp; Co.,"First of all I’m too old to worry about Reddit Karma. So downvote away. 
I am a Grateful Dead fan and have been for most of my life. I am not a Dead &amp; Co fan but I am happy they are out there keeping the music alive. 
I have a few questions for any Dead &amp; Co fans that would like to answer. 
Why do you treat this band as if they are the Grateful Dead? There have been many other bands featuring Grateful Dead members since Jerry died and no one acted like they were seeing the Grateful Dead at those shows. 
Why is it I am not allowed to dislike Dead &amp; Co as a Deadhead? I’m am destroyed every time I tell a Dead &amp; Co fan that I don’t like JM. 
This really bothers me. I have never felt hatred from a fellow Head before. I never saw the Grateful Dead in their prime (although ‘89 and early ‘90 were really good) and I always am jealous of people who did. But I don’t hate them because of that. I always ask them what was it like in insert year here. 
Thank you young fans for embracing this incredible music. I hope you pass it down to your children. Just give us old guys/girls a break.

Sonic Bliss - My Grateful Dead Story - PT 1,"Sonic Bliss - PT 1. The Beginning of my Grateful Dead Story

John Mayer once said this of the Grateful Dead: “These great bands, these seminal bands. They will find you at a time in your life. You can’t say you’re not into it. You can say you’re not into it yet.” Grateful Dead music has been an omnipresent factor in my life, but I never really gave into the music until recently. 

I remember my very first encounter with the Dead’s music was initiated by my best friend in high school. He was a year older than me and I remember sitting in his car as a sophomore and he had just started playing Bertha (I can’t remember what version). I thought it was a cool song, but I wasn’t blown away (disclaimer - at this point, the majority of my music taste at the time consisted of hip-hop and rap from the East Coast). My friend had told me stories of his dad who grew up in the Bay Area during the 60’s and was a true Deadhead, ultimately seeing something like 234 shows. I didn’t understand how anyone could ever see a band that many times. (But, honestly, if I could, I would have done the same :) )

Flash forward a few years and I’m in college. I took a Popular Music of the United States course where I learned about the influence popular artists had over the culture of the U.S. throughout history. My appreciation for rock, blues, psychidelic-rock increased exponentially as I spent hours listening to Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and B.B. King.

In a particularly fun lecture, my professor had a picture of the Dead playing the Acid Tests on a slide, ushering in a short lecture on the Dead. I learned how the Dead influenced the 60’s counterculture movement through their psychedelic melodies as they played the Acid Tests and Haight-Ashbury. I remember my professor played Uncle John’s Band for the class, and he just stood there, bobbing to the rhythm, his eyes closed, entranced by the music. 

But shit hit the fan before I really had any time to begin listening to the Grateful Dead. Cancer had once again stricken my favorite teacher in high school, another Deadhead from the 60’s who had always tried to turn me on to Grateful Dead music. He was more than a psychology teacher to me - more like a grandfather. I used to go to his class after school had ended and we used to discuss philosophy, music, science, psychology, etc. 

It wasn’t long before he passed away, and I was devastated. I couldn’t see the beauty in the world any more. Even though I consider myself a person who believes in reincarnation and multiple lives, I couldn't bear to think that I was never able to talk to one of my favorite people ever again.

And then... the Grateful Dead changed my life.

I was sitting in my room alone maybe a week after I heard the news. I was scrolling through my music library on my phone to take my mind off of the sadness I was suppressing when a strange album artwork caught my eye. 

Europe 72! I completely forgot I had downloaded it earlier in the year, meaning to listen to it when I got the chance. I quickly rushed and grabbed my headphones and began the album. As soon as Cumberland Blues came on, I felt the sorrow for my teacher’s death fade away slowly as I began smiling and dancing in my room. I savored every second of the album like it was a delicious meal. 

And then Morning Dew. Ahh Morning Dew. When Jerry’s solo kicked in, I felt my eyes water as he stirred emotions within me I still can’t explain. I closed my eyes and it was in that moment I came to a peaceful resolution with my teacher’s passing. I listened to Europe 72 three more times that night before I went to bed, the weight finally lifted off my shoulders.

Good resources for the logistical/technical side of the band’s jams?,"I’m interested in exactly what was going on onstage when the guys were in the middle of a jam. Take Playin’ In The Band for instance; in the early 70s era, the band would drop into a very minor sounding jam while Jerry plays with his guitar through a wah pedal. This jam could lead to various other songs like Uncle John, etc. What particular cues or signals would the band use to navigate this improvisational space or know when to go to the next song? Were there certain phrases played by Jerry? Hand signals? 

Or, whenever the band truly dropped into a total improvisation effort, who decided where the jam was ultimately going? How much of the jam was truly rehearsed and how much was spontaneous? How did they communicate to form such effortless transitions between rehearsed sections and improv sections?

I’m basically looking for any and all resources that talk about this certain aspect of their music. I play guitar in a band now and we are starting to be able to transition to and from songs pretty smoothly, but I would love to broaden our communication while playing and am looking for tips from the masters.

**Holy crap!** So many responses the first round! Some pretty good upsets from this past round but no 16 seed beat the #1 seed \(unlike Virginia losing in the NCAA tourney\). This bring us to the final 32, go ahead and vote as this round is pretty short and quick

Original Overview: Back for a second year in a row, this time we’re doing the TOP SHOWS OF ALL TIME will be seeded in a field of 64. What shows makes you weep, what song makes you dance, and ultimately, what show makes you get up out of your chair and sing. Please listen to the archives before voting!

Couple things:

* There are soooo many great/legendary Grateful Dead shows out of the 2,317, this is not meant for an argument. Comments are welcome \(of course, we’re on Reddit\), but the bracket won't change.
* The seeds have been selected by a consensus. Communication went out to 145 deadheads asking for a list of what they thought were their top 100 GD shows of all time. This tasks was not for the faint of heart. 76 dedicated souls responded with their list, 69 men and 7 women. Of the respondents, the elder statesmen saw their first show in 1968, the youngest pup \(in deadhead years\) wasn't even born to see Jerry\(but is a rabid deadhead nonetheless\), everyone else fell in between \(the average saw their 1st show spring 1984\).
* Each round will consist be a few days long and will fall inline with what the NCAA brackets schedules are.
* Please dont vote twice :\)
* Maybe this will open you to a new show you never heard before or take you back to a show you forgot about.
* This is meant to be fun

The Devastating Moment When the Shirt is Just for Fashion,"I'm sure we've all been there before. You see someone wearing a Dead shirt. You approach them and ask about the shirt. They look at you blankly, realize you're talking about their shirt, and say that they don't know the band but they like the shirt. Today I was at the gym in Paris and saw a guy wearing a Stealie shirt. I've been here two months and haven't seen a single Dancing Bear, Stealie or Skull 'n Roses anywhere. I excitedly approached him, cobbled some French together, and asked if he was a fan. He stared at me and said nothing. Realizing that my French was probably off, I pointed to the shirt. Nothing. I asked again. He nodded and said that he has never heard the Dead before but it's a cool shirt. People can wear whatever they want and I don't want to be elitist or anything but damn it's a bummer when that happens! ",gratefuldead,1521309883,maybeimaleo,32,65,True,2018-03-17

"Looking for ""critique"" books about the Dead","Hi everybody, I have read ""A Long Strange Trip"" by McNally and Phil Lesh's autobiography, plus I've received the huge Illustrated History book as a present from a dear friend. I got the whole biography side covered, I think, so I'm looking to read something different :)

As a musician myself, I've wondered if there are any books about the Dead that have a critique approach (sorry if this isn't the correct term!). I'd like to read about how they improvised, how they traded chords during the jams, how they rehearsed, any in-depth look would be very interesting for me.

Found this recently, looks like a bunch of Dead memorabilia up for auction. Some of the items are pretty cool - a few I've never seen before like the Swiss Army Knife.

More from the website: 
&gt;One of the most significant bands in history, The Grateful Dead did more than simply entertain. They inspired a generation. With love for everyone, music that made all the worries disapper, and a knack for knowing how to have a great time, The Dead led a revolution. This collection offers the opportunity to win items that helped shaped that revolution. From original artwork that posters replicated, to pendants hand crafted by Owsley ""Bear"" Stanley, memorabilia signed by the band, to passes that saw them at their shows, and even a motorcycle that got them all around. The Grateful Dead Memorabilia Auction offers an opportunity to bid on history.

Donna Jean's Best High Time,"I am watching 6/19/76 currently, and the vocals on High Time were incredible.

So, in the 90-or-so minutes that I'll be driving tomorrow, I'm going to listen to all of them and try to determine the best, or at least my favorite. Stay tuned. 

The shows:
1976: 6/9, 6/12, 6/14, 6/19, 6/23, 6/28, 7/13, 7/16, 9/23

The Best Band Ever,"About two years ago my dad and I were driving back from eating out and “Friend of The Devil” came on the radio. My dad told me it was by a band called The Grateful Dead, I listened to the song and thought it a little lack lustre, I dismissed it then and there. Then, about a year ago, I saw The Other One - the Netflix documentary on Bob Weir -  and became much more interested in The Grateful Dead. I started listening to their music and really started liking it, but I never understood why Deadheads were so crazy about this band. Then about 6 months ago I watched “Long Strange Trip” and ever since I began listening to their live stuff and fully understand why they’re the greatest band to ever walk the face of this Earth. They invoke feelings of such pure and honest blissfulness that I’ve never felt before in my life. I don’t know how to explain the way they make me feel but it’s something incredible.

First sets for '77 could be as deadly as second ones, and here's a prototype example - they lay everything down with total precision and then comes this wild suite following Estimated and anchored by a truly dark, strange, ethereal Playin'. The energy propels that Samson right through, and into the reprise. Often Playin' is unmentioned in so many show reviews due to out sheer familiarity with it, but, seriously folks, soak this thing up.
Set 2 is a no-holds-barred suite from start to finish - Eyes is bright and delightful, and check out that the beginning of that supercharged Sugar Magnolia!!! *Y-O-W*!
The winter '77 Winterland shows are to cherish, but this one hold its own against any other show of this year. It's a masterpiece.

&gt; My First Show, Thanks!
As mentioned this was my first show. We stuck around for 3-20 but ran out of money and went home after that. Long ago I sought out tapes of this show and never found anything passable. Upon the dawn of the digital era I sought it out again and was able to find a ""sbd"" of dubious quality. Eventually I went with the better sounding audio.
Then, upon my 24 year anniversary, I came here and found Joe's excellent source. Thanks for uploading this show. I had always wondered why I saw so many mic stands at the shows but never heard a good recording. This is the source I've been waiting for.
Solid show, I love the Visions. I also loved the screwed up Truckin'. When Bob said, on 3-20 just before they played Box of Rain, that they were going to prove practice makes perfect, I was fully expecting them to play Truckin' again. Little did I know, at the time, the significance of that moment. Thanks again Joe, for sharing this excellent source.

&gt; Special Show. One of the best of the tour
And this was probably the most consistent tour of a GREAT touring year. So much happened in 1990, and March was so on. In terms of what the band had built towards since 1988. A ""lean rock 'n' roll sound"" as Garcia put it in some interview. but really that was such a modest way to put it. 
The Foolish Heart is simply the best ever. Next to maybe 88.7.2, and 90.7.12... Sure Jer flubs a few words, but the end jam really show colour and creativity from especially Jerry, Phil, and Brent. 
You gotta love where they were going with this lineup. So sad Brent went when he did. Imagine how much more focused they could have gotten if it wern't for certainly unfortunate elements. 
Hartford 90. A Great show.

&gt; Like following your favorite sports team
The boys in the late 90s were like following your favorite team. They can't win every game, some nights they look like champs, other nights also-rans. But you could always find a little something that keeps you optimistic. And the GD were like a baseball franchise in that they played so many shows. No way were they going to throw no-hitters or hit ten home runs a show. Anyway, I grew up in Philly but lived in Tennessee during most of my touring days. So it was always nice to be back home at the Spectrum for a run. I caught the Sat-Sun, and people knock Jerry left and right for '95 shows, but anyone who was there to hear Visions or Johanna on the 18th (listen to it now on archive) witnessed an amazing performance of perhaps Dylan's best song. That was the home run like I mentioned that kept you wanting more and kept you rooting for the ""team."" And the setlist on the 19th wasn't spectacular, but it was nice to hear Alabama in advance of the Birmingham shows I'd attend a few weeks later. If you were there for the Unbroken, the hair on your neck still rises when you take yourself back to that moment etched in time. Yeah, after that it just became another We Want Phil tune. But that moment was like a ticker-tape parade for the champions. Five stars for goose bumps, and hugging strangers all around you; end of story.

&gt; They opened for Iron Butterfly at this gig and the set was supposed to end with Lovelight. But (and I have this information from a person who was backstage at the show), after listening to the Dead burn the house down, Iron Butterfly didn't want to come out. So, the Dead came back on to play a ""few more minutes"" and proceeded to add insult to IB's injury with the Cryptical sandwich, Feedback, and AWBYG.  
  
and  
&gt; They are playing for their lives on this and I can see how Iron Butterly felt upstaged - They crush anything after that. Remember at the time, IB had inna gadda da vida which was huge and GD just came out and rolled em. Billy is nuts on the drums and Pig blows the door off Lovelight.
Sound is slacking but musically this is really hot. They come out with this over the top Other One which to me deserves 5 stars for the attitude alone - So funny they were this cocky in St. Louis and then crapped out at Woodstock 6 months later. How different would history have been if they played this set there... Moral of the story: guys dont eat the brown acid.

and  
&gt; This is a solid show from early 1970, and if you're a big fan of that period, I highly recommend it. The only major cut that I noticed was in 'Dancing in the Street' which hurt alot because they kill that song in 1970 with Jerry's awesome back ups. However, aside from that cut, its a great show with a killer 'The Other One' which bursts out of nowhere.

It was a pretty good year for the band.
year(s) of the Snake 65/77/89
Jack A Roe- great tune but a tad muddy here.
Jerry has a lyric malfunction.(No harm done)
One of the prettier tunes in the catalog.
And really not a ballad has that nice clip.
A super brief few seconds of SPACE&gt; Queen Jane
-much maligned but really a pretty tune
Garcia nice backing vocals to start.
The less Bobby tries to sound nasal
like Dylan the better for this song.
B.E. Woman-Always one of my favorites!
Jerry is strumming it way in advance here.
Brent in there singing with Garcia.
Jack A Roe, Queen Jane, B.E. Woman
create a good mellow vibe.
Cassidy-The shorter non-exploratory version
""Blow the horn and tap the tambourine""
Tenn Jed-for Chinese New Year? Sure, why not.
Probably a 4 for this 1st set
The encore placed in between sets throws off the track labeling.
Black Muddy was killed in the encore slot.
Bucket-I have to say this tune actually stands up better than Throwing Stones for me.
It has a biting edge that is still fresh today.
Good to hear Phil!!! a tad muddy with all that Rhythm section and Brent on Organ. 
&gt;SCARLET-Keep hearing a MIDI effect like a horn.
If BUCKET somewhat bitter,Scarlet is always SWEET 
""One of these days, you can get shown the light""
The band seems pretty wound up, almost like Garcia stretches vocals to slow it down a little.
The SCARLET jam has a lot going on including PHIL
&gt;Looks Like Rain- slows it down like an anchor.

**Soundboard Transferred by Don Bean**  
***  
**from archive.org:**  
&gt; The old town still looks the same... Well the accidental acoustic set in New Orleans bares fruit as Garcia plays pedal steel on the first three tracks.
This show opens with GREEN GRASS which is for lack of a better term a 'Ghost tune' meaning the song is written from the perspective of a person who has already died.
Probably the most famous ghost tune the Dead played was EL PASO because the guy in that song is telling the story after he has already died.
So it is with GREEN GRASS the singer is relating a story from when he was alive.
One could argue that the story of both El PASO and GREEN GRASS are from the perspective of someone dying but it seems to me when the tune gets sung it makes it a done deal by the time the song concludes.
Either way you slice it songs like this are loaded with irony when performed by a band called the GRATEFUL DEAD
If you want to hear the full uncut SAWMILL and SEASONS refer to the NEW ORLEANS show a week before. (Worth a listen for sure)
China &gt; Rider- perhaps a bit speeded up
High Time-Wow! This tune should have been in the Jerry Ballad slot in the later years it is so freak-in mellow.
I was going to give this a 4 because of sound issues but really I wouldn't be caught DEAD without this so it is another 5 spot.

Uncle John's Band -&gt; This a nice very laid back U.J.B. The vocals are incredible. Plus the pacing of the tune is just like a slow dance with just the slightest up-tempo.
I wonder if ROBERT HUNTER wrote ROW JIMMY watching folks dance to this song.
Also I think it is Phil and perhaps PIG singing that make the U.J.B vocals so distinct in 1970. 
&gt; Black Peter-I love this time period for it's very mellow tunes.
Good Lovin' -&gt;
Drums -&gt;
Good Lovin'
This show is not going to jam you to the outer limits but if you like BEAR'S CHOICE you should really dig on this show,
Perhaps the only big difference is this is not completely acoustic and PIGPEN is not playing any slow tunes here.

&gt; We use to play for silver, now we play for GOLD
Set One
Hey Pocky Way-Good way to get things started.
Brent's influence so great 89/90
3 tunes from Mydland this show.
Jack Straw-A rockin' version! 
&gt;Loser-Old School! Moaning low
Walkin Blues-""leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blind""- ""Casey said just before he died fix the blinds so that the bums can't ride if they ride let 'em ride the rods put their trust in the hands of God""
A Little Light- This is somewhat subdued version, by the time this rolled out on summer tour Brent was bringing down the house with this number.
Standing on the Moon- really like this in 1st set.
This tune in fine line of Hunter/Garcia ballads.
Memphis Blues- They overplayed this song if only considering just the tunes the Dead/Dylan played Summer of 87 and never broke out after that tour. --------Nice Space moment before Memphis!
Brent has got the organ going on.
Jerry singing backup for Weir.
Bobby sings w/o nasal whine makes it better tune.
Bird Song-Sweet end of set choice
You know folks talk about the intensity of the East Coast tours just imagine if the Dead had played something like that January 78 West Coast swing every year.
Decent Jam in the Bird Song! 
Set Two 
What a way to bring the AIKO, Aiko-- HEY NOW!!!
Victim-someone said perverse? 
well how about SOBERING.
Talk about instant mood shift.
(a B.I.O.D.T.L. count before Bob's first lyrics.)
We Can Run-underwhelming after the VICTIM plunge.
Still this is a catchy tune and Garcia bringing the backing vocals doesn't hurt any.
&gt;&gt;&gt;All express train until end of set&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;Uncle John's Band-(that's the ticket!)
&gt;Drums&gt;Space&gt;The Wheel&gt;Throwing Stones
&gt;Foolish Heart-nice call instead of slow ballad
&gt;Good Lovin'-""Got to have Love""
e) Knockin- There's our closing ballad.

Grateful Discussion 16: The Pizza Tapes,"Before I start with the discussion I wanted everyone to know the discord is up and running so if you want an invite just let me know and I’ll invite you when I get home. Or ask /u/connor09

The discord’s purpose is to bring together more people associated with playing games or wanting friendship with a common interest: the Dead. We will be hosting listening parties occasionally so make sure to stay updated. Eventually we will sort out a day or two of the week for the listening party. This weeks day is Saturday.

Onto the pizza tapes.

To me this is one of the coolest albums. It’s a hanging out with friends, eating pizza, getting stoned, and playing banjo music album.

There is a story behind this album and why it’s called the pizza tapes. If this is inaccurate someone please set me straight. 

Jerry, Tony, and David were hanging out playing banjo music and they ordered a pizza. When the pizza guy arrived he stole tapes of the music and later on these tapes were recovered I think after Jerry’s death.

Anyways in this album you will find amazing songs such as: multiple shady groves, multiple man of constant sorrows, a shady jam, some banjo space, knocking on heavens door, and the only recorded Amazing Grace that Jerry has done.

Those to me are the highlights.",gratefuldead,1518031471,Stratengar,20,12,True,2018-02-07
How young is too young to bring a child to a Dead and Co concert?,"Wife and I received tickets to an upcoming Dead and Co show this summer. We could have my mother or mother in law watch our daughter (would be 7 months at time of concert), but I honestly want to bring her and experience the show with her. My wife or I would be carrying/wearing her the whole time with those noise cancelling headphones they make for kids. My wife is completely sober, and I might have a couple beers. My question is...is 7 months too young to bring her?

Edit: Thanks for the input! The concert is at an amusement park, and we will be staying at the onsite hotel while several friends with kids (age 4-9) camp on site. Figure we will enjoy the park and campsite with friends and feel out the concert when the time comes. If it's not feeling right the wife will hang at the hotel and i'll prob dip out a bit early.

**from archive.org:**  
&gt; This is one of the first Grateful Dead shows I listened to and it still remains a subtle display of just how powerful the band is. Though it is not epic in size and the sound quality is not super clean, it makes up for it in how real the songs are played. The Smokestack on here makes you feel like your riding a train, the Morning Dew is absolutely gorgeous with the effects working perfectly with the definition of the song, Jerry chiming in with Bobby on the high part in China Cat, Top Of The World sounding so good you really feel on top of the world. And that's just the first set. The second set features one of the best Hurt Me Too's, followed by a Dark Star so majestic crashing into that way far out middle part, a really solid St. Stephen &gt; Not Fade Away &gt; St. Stephen and a massive Lovelight to finish the show off proper. Thanks to the providers of this wonderful show!  
  
and  
&gt; The last of five days in San Fran (four of them at the Fillmore West) of which four have been (partially) officially released . Bill Graham jokes about the New Orleans bust and gives Jer a copy of the single (or photo jacket) by Michael James Brody. Bluesman Taj Mahal was followed by one long Dead set. One of a handful of shows I would argue needs a proper release for the middle section (which they apparently have in the vault). 
Smokestack goes straight into the jam and, though always nice, this version is a bit vampish (next week's was much better). There were only 5 in '70, but TC had just left the band so they needed some Pig filler. Morning Dew &amp; Dire Wolf are good performances hindered today by poor sources. There were only 6 versions of Sitting On Top of the World in '70 and this may be the best. If you can get past the quality, the same can be said for China Cat&gt;Rider. Hopefully it will get released as it's up there with 1/18 &amp; 2/13, maybe better than 6/24 and 10/04. Dark Star is average '70 (there are so many, you can be choosy). The Saint Stephen sandwich with Not Fade is great fun. Between 4min and 6min into the latter Jer seriously digs in. Some sections of the 35min Love Light are good but most are you-had-to-be-there.
Grade = B-   /  3 ½ Stars
 Highlights:
Sitting On Top of the World - No longer a set standard by '70 yet played great
China Cat Sunflower&gt;I Know You Rider - shines through tinniness
Not Fade Away - bookended by two short Stephens
SOURCES: The cotsman composite is the best , compiling best available sources, though the balance is way off in places and you need the cousinit AUD for the 4 middle songs (for the AUDs, playback in mono with some EQ works better). From the end of Dark Star on is SBD. Smokestack and Sitting are bonus tracks on Bear's Choice.

My Barlow story I posted to FB.,"The world is not as smart, funny, compassionate, brave, or creative as it was just a couple days ago.


I knew John Perry Barlow, but so many people knew Barlow. I met him at Spalding Gray's funeral in 2004 and soon he joined the advisory board of my nonprofit. He was so generous with his time that he once even helped my son with a high school project on internet privacy.


Many of you know Barlow as a lyricist for the Grateful Dead. We shared a cab once in Washington, DC and he lent me $40. I told him I'd never pay him back so that one day when he was gone I could tell everyone that he died before I could pay him and that he should know better than to lend money to a Deadhead. He laughed and it became a running joke between us.


Barlow, was a hero of mine. He was also a friend of mine. He once lent me forty dollars and I never paid him back. He should have known better than to lend money to a Deadhead.


Rest In Peace, my magical friend.

&gt; Can't go wrong with a 73 show. Great jazzy jams especially Playin' and Eyes. Solid performance throughout. Some of the harmonies are a little wonky (it's almost redundant to name HCS here) but overall not too bad - actually Donna nails Row Jimmy quite beautifully.
I came to the realization while listening to this show that I actually prefer the lyrics to Wave the Flag over US Blues!  
  
and  
&gt; Greatest Big River (ever)... In addition to all of the awesome and well-deserved accolades for this landmark show, there’s one unsung gem: the best Big River...in spite of itself. 
During an interview in the late '80s, Jerry was asked if there were any songs he was really sick of playing. ""If I never had to play Big River again I'd be OK with that."" 
Well...behold the best version they ever did -- even if they miss the ending and take it around to the chorus an extra time. This is a barnburner and a supreme highpoint from Jerry’s ""Alligator"" Strat era (and oh the tone through that Wall of Sound) prior to the delivery of Doug Irwin’s ""Wolf"" guitar a couple of months later. 
Likewise, Bobby's counter-rhythm was never better either.

On a dark and windblown rainy Friday night
At Stanford's new gym.
The first and final GD concert at this venue. Bill Graham had to pay to have the floor re-done for all the burn holes and the GD were never asked back by the university or requested to return by BGP.
Too bad, really, this was a perfect venue for the GD. It was much more sonically appealing than Winterland and much more accessible if you were arriving from afar.
And if you were there that night you exited more than 80 miles high.

**from archive.org:**  
&gt;  Despite the sound's remoteness, this is a very good show from Winter '79
1st Set: ""Promised"" nicely explodes upon landing. It's a quick and darting performance. Jerry welcomes us with a ""Candyman"" that's awfully marred by the terrible muted sound quality. ""Cassidy"" is a ripsnorter. ""Tennessee Jed"" is nicely harmonized, but is stifled by a sluggish pace. Tho, Jerry does hit some nice notes when it counts. ""Es Paso"" is passionately read by Bobby. ""Jack"" sounds about the same as it did last night, but is a tad snappier and a tad less flavorful. ""LLR"" fills out the power ballad slot nicely as well as thematically fitting after the hard-won love affair of 'Jack.' The intent is there for ""Stagger,"" but they have got to pick up its pace. ""Passenger"" is high-energy, if not particularly distinctive. One of the first ""China/Rider's"" since its Winterland 12/29/77 is well-received tho never takes off til the later, whose dynamite is Not fully appreciated by this yucky tape. 
2nd Set: Nice change of pace, opening with a ""NFA."" Random excursions lead to a nice slide and lead interplay at 5:45 through 6:30. Jerry then takes off on his own magical journey til we reconvene to sing a haunting outro...things get quiet and then BOOM... ""Miracle"" time. Crowd certainly appreciating the silence to over the top rock n roll. ""Bertha"" continues the good times with an agreeable if not standout version. ""Good Lovin"" raises the stakes yet again, and now I'm pissed that this tape is providing only half the requisite sound quality needed to fully enjoy this impressive set. ""From the Heart of Me"" does what's necessary, and provide a moment to chill. Rumble me gently, let's sway to a soothing ""He's Gone."" It's patient, comforting and well-told; Jerry remains on stage with the drummers for an extended noodling session that's not distancing because of the hearty meal being presented to us by the band this evening. ""Drums/Space"" pass the test, which sails into a ""Truckin"" that's decent, but carries with it a little less energy, a little more mellow, than the songs pre-Drums. ""Comes a Time"" is a beautiful choice as something with the neglectful, mourning ""Black Peter"" or ""Wharf Rat."" ""Around and Around"" concludes matters on a righteous note, building us all into a slightly uncontained frenzy. 
Let's continue the party by throwing KC a decent ""Shakedown"" encore. 
If it wasn't for this shoddy tape, this would be a 4 star experience. As it is, it's a 3 1/2 rated downward for an honest appraisel of the sound.

**from archive.org:**  
&gt; Chinese New Year 1986...
I'm surprised no one has written a review of this show yet. I went to both Chinese New Year shows in 1986, this night and the night before it. Both were incredible bay area shows.
Before each of the two Chinese New Year shows, a Chinese band opened the show. The Chinese band was playing already when we first came into the venue. They were playing Chinese music.
During drums, I made my way down to the main floor after an incredible He's Gone -&gt; Smokestack followed by Comes A Time. Shortly after I arrived on the main floor, Space began. A few minutes later, something very unusual happened. The crowd started to cheer. It is not unusual for the crowd at a Dead show to cheer suddenly, but this was in the middle of Space, and it was a sustained cheering, long before the band was ready to come out of Space, so I knew it wasn't just because people had heard the first few notes of what the band would be going into out of Space. There was something else about the way the crowd was cheering. It continued for a while and became progressively louder. Then I noticed that the people on the main floor with me were starting to turn around and look toward the back of the venue. I looked up into the seating area on the sides of the venue and they were all looking toward the back of the venue too.
I turned around and couldn't believe my eyes. Weaving its way through the main floor, only a short distance away from where I stood, was a giant, brightly-colored Chinese dragon. It was writhing and swaying, and a few times it blew real flames from its nostrils. I was standing just behind the soundboard on the Phil side of the room and it was headed right for me. As it got closer, I could see that it was supported by several people who were controlling the motion of the giant dragon with sticks that they were using to make it look like the dragon was moving on its own. It took about 6 or 7 people to control it. As they came closer and made their way right past me, so close that I could touch them, I saw who it was. It was the Chinese band that had opened the show. They were controlling this huge fire breathing dragon that had emerged from the back of the venue during space and was winding its way toward the stage.
If you listen to recordings of this show, you can hear the crowd's reaction during Space. The cheering might be more noticeable on audience recordings of the show.
The dragon wove its way through the dense crowd, up one side of the stage, across the stage with the band still playing Space, and then it exited through the back of the stage never to be seen again. Shortly after that, the Dead went into one of the coolest Other Ones I've ever heard in my life, which didn't have the characteristic intro that The Other One usually has. It had a more subtle, almost spooky, lead in and it was not nearly as obvious at the time what they were going into.
I've searched the Internet long and hard for any photos that anyone might have of that dragon, but I have found nothing. It was one of the coolest, and most unexpected things that I have ever seen happen at a Dead show.

Grateful Discussion 17: Keyboard heavy shows,"As a Brent fan and overall lover of the keyboard playing for the dead from all sides whether it’s Vincent, or Keith I enjoy a good keyboardist, but it I also love when they get thrown into the spotlight which is why I wanted to talk keyboard today.

Post some really good keyboard moments that you truly appreciate. If I had to pick one it would either be the keyboard playing in the dark star from 10/26/89 or the little bit of playing nearing the end of the other famous dark star from 8/27/72. 

Anyone got a show with either perfectly held back keyboard playing? Maybe a show that’s dripping with notes? Or just one song where it overshadows anything else in the song.

One last thing guys. There’s going to be a listening party tomorrow night on my discord. I don’t know eastern time in the United States and I also don’t know other time zones than my own so unfortunately for just this one post I’m only going to post my time zone and you can do the math this once.

Tell me if you want an invite to the discord. I’ll end up posting it soon I am unable to right now though. The listening party will be for the Help on the Way weekly. Other listening parties for what I want to listen to occasionally will happen and I’m open to suggestions. Cya then.

From what I know so far is it was a cult of women based around their leader named Joseph, they would spin to the music at Dead shows, and they viewed Jerry as a spiritual figure like a Hindu avatar. I've also heard in a documentary on the Dead that they wouldn't spin during ""Bob Weir songs"", I'm guessing this means songs where Weir was the lead vocalist, which seems like a lot of songs. Also was the spinning influenced by Dervishes and Sufism, and if so was it more an interest in the mysticism of Sufism or was there an actual interest in Islam among the spinners?",gratefuldead,1518225623,Clash_The_Truth,20,14,True,2018-02-09

&gt; I'm not sure if those people are saying Jerry's voice sounds like shit or are the they referring to his playing. In either case,since this is a rehersal it really doesn't matter all that much. I have been a fan since the late 60's and have listened how the band sounded over the years. I have never been a real fan of this song,partly due to it's extreme slowness. But one must keep in mind that the words will dictate the pace of the music. Given the meaning of the words to this song,it really can't be sung or played in any other rational way. Afterall ,we're talking about a person getting into an age where the world has beaten them down a bit and it is a recounting of the idealism of youth and what it means now ,if anything. This is really a true G/H song that only those two men could know. So only one voice can be sing it well and feel it more.  
  
and  
&gt; Subject: Important Piece of History
IMHO the last truly great Hunter/Garcia song, it works it's way under your skin and slowly melts into your soul giving you chills at the same time. The work up is interesting, the 2nd take is comparatively polished. So simple and yet so complicated. Wish Rhino would release a version of it on one of their never ending live sets. 5 stars just for existing.

Summer Tour song prediction contest - February trial run,"Hey now, everyone.

So... Based on responses to my post last month, I'm gonna try a trial run of a tour song contest.  The prize for this trial contest will be a $25 gift certificate to dead.net and one of the official 50th anniversary pins that I got at Fare Thee Well.  Here's what I'm thinking:  

I'll set up a Survey Monkey link for each Dead and Co show, starting with February 24th in New Orleans.  The contest will run for three shows.  I'll post the link when we get closer to the date.

If you want to participate, take the first show survey - pick a first set tune, a second set, and an encore.  One point for each correct guess, and a two point bonus if you're correct on all three.

The survey results get sent to me by Survey Monkey.  I'll tabulate the results and post the leaderboard.  Sound ok?  Should it be different, somehow?

&gt; not that bad... if it were 1970 we would call this a VG audience tape. while theres minimal high end and the drums are hard to hear, Weir / Lesh / Garcia are all there and easy to follow, plus this a steady tape with minimal audience interference  
  
and  
&gt; This tape sounds every bit of its 26 years...Even though the show is decent, avoid this recording. Besides, you'll find better 2/9 &amp; 10.
1st Set: ""Promised"" is loose and carefree despite sloppy playing and Bobby's oft forgetting of the lyrcis. Evidently, they're trying, but ""Sugaree"" sounds tired and messy. Frankly, this cloudy recording isn't helping matters. ""Mama"" is short, speedy and harmless. ""Mexicali"" is well-played but undistinctive. ""FOTD"" accurately conveys the tone of this man's lamentable situation. Our first ""Lazy/Supplication"" in a week is fine, but this dull recording is really beginning to frustrate me. It's tough to manufacture enthusiasm when the sound is this stunted. Yet 'Supp' builds to tense if not exploding climax. My goodness, let the fresh riches overflow with a bright, perky ""Might as Well"" This version's a real success to keep the set flowing. No time for anything solemn or maudlin; Lesh's thick grooves announce a highly musical if not mind-bending ""Music."" 
2nd Set: Feel the percussive movements, let the foot-stomping begin, because it's time for a Bobby Sunday school lesson. ""Sampson"" is nice, but due to the thin quality of this sound...(it's yucky) it's not really overly enjoyable. The same could be said for the ""China/Rider"" that follows... The 'Rider' is especially tense, but due to the remoteness of the sound, the quality of the playing is difficult to ascertain. ""From"" is standard, and predictable... a 'Ship' would have made a better choice. ""Terrapin"" is a pleasure but does not deviate from the norm. ""Playing"" is a predictable but generous selection. The jam is nice... Wow, I am so disinterested in reviewing the rest of this show. Suffice to say, the playing is fine, equivalent to 'good ol' GD,' but nothing astounding. The encore is missing from this tape... BUT to all those venture into these murky warnings, it is at Your discretion.

&gt; Loved it then still do.
Nice thing about this website is we get to relive those years of life anytime we want. Is like on demand on TV these days. 
I was just to the right of jerry in the very last entrance to the hallway. Anyone who has been to the Kaiser's knows the spot. In the years past it was the way up to the bar. Eventually they moved the bar to the basement. Anyway we were in the middle of the Rhythm devils parade wow that was intense. Knew our placement was in the way but it is where we all hung out back then. 
As they made there way to the stage we knew it would be Aiko but with a twist, Neville brothers sure loved playing with the boys. In the Middle of Aiko can hear either Billy or Mickey screaming Aiko. As they jammed along it sounds to me like they never told each other what they were to play. has one of those moments to it where they sound like they want to go into something else but just stick with a prolnged Aiko. Then came Eye's and I know I was surprised. Rest of the show is just as fun. lots of Improv and jamming going anywhere they want it to. Now that's good ole Grateful dead to me. 5 stars because they are the best and the sound has it too

&gt; I loved this performance and the soud quality is outstanding. The show the night before was good but this is even better. Now off to listen to the third night of this L.A. run.  
  
and  
&gt;  A long but worthy gig from the City of Angels
I prefer this sound to the static-y (sheath in front of the speaker)noise on the other recording. 
**1st Set:** After a minute of tuning, a comfortable, somewhat rousing stroll through ""Mississippi."" The 'Forum Fillies' are looking good throughout an eager, perfectly acceptable ""Minglewood."" Up next, is an easy to follow seemingly abbreviated 6 minute ""Candyman."" A focused, direct ""Big River"" is next. We have a debut: Jerry's '89 version of 'Push,' the title track ""Built to Last."" Even though this is its first public offering, it sounds none too different than any other version. A professional ""Queen Jane"" follows that's accenuated by pretty Jerry lines and a keen charge at the end. An impassioned sung ""We Can Run"" is notable for its brevity. Let's sing and clap-along at the top of the 4's. the ""Bird"" flies by next. Pretty standard despite some odd purposefully anti-gelling jamming mid-way through. Only average climax making me believe they should have closed the set off with 'Promised.' 
**2nd Set:** On the bright side, ""China"" gets us back to dancing. I can't say the presentation was particularly novel, but a good time was had. A consistently rigorous ""Rider"" maintains momentum. It moves real quickly but doesn't pave new roads. ""Man Smart"" follows the same pattern. Tight and focused with plenty of energy but not much invention. A minimalist ""Standing"" confirms that this song has matured fast. Unfortunately, by eliminating all musical momentum, the first two-three minutes of ""Estimated"" lack that special 'craze.' There must have been an agreement made between band members to purposely stretch out the song before ""Drums"" into a jamming vehicle. However, at around the ten minute mark ""Estimated"" begins its dissolution into 'Space' like brain farts. Ooopsy, my mistake because around 13:30 the tones get awfully kiddy leading to Brent's lullabye ""Take You Home."" Someone's strumming a well-placed acoustic sounding guitar. Finally, it's ""Drums"" time which includes some 'lovely ladies' chanting in a foreign dialect. Around 8:30 on for a minute, it sounds as if they're documenting the burning of a Vietnamese village with the men pleading for God to intervene. After a short ""Space"" a barebones ""Eyes"" emerges. Consider a ride through farmland country...sort of bumbling characters, 'Apple Dumpling Gang' made introspective. Very fine 2 1/2 minute outro...jazzy groovin thang. Now completely changing tones, cause we're in LA... a ""Miracle."" After a minute of altering sensibilities, Jerry and company make ado. Bobby's sings the tune in an odd but sincere timewarp. ""Find her in a sideshow...leave her, errgh right here."" Next the sad tale of ""Black Peter"" which is musically like 'Eyes' in that it's minimal and reaches its pinnacle in its outro. Good times through a consistent ""Lovelite."" Digging Brent's swirling boards, Not Bobby's cheesy vocal presentation.
This is an appropriate location for ""Box."" Nice all-around work from Phil. Weak harmonizing. ""Thank you; Goodnight."" (Phil)
3 1/4 stars

Grateful Discussion 18: Blues for Allah studio album,"This album being in my top 3 favorite Dead albums makes this a fun Discussion to start. I’ve been slacking a little, being either late or not doing these discussions everyday. I’ll try to change that.

Anyways this album contains some of my favorite Dead songs such as: Help on the way/slipknot/Franklins Tower, King Solomon’s marbles, crazy fingers, the music never stopped, and surprisingly to some Blues for Allah.

The classic franklin segue was part of my beginning into loving how the dead can transition between songs.

King Solomon’s marbles is great for not only dancing, but I have found it helpful for cleaning my room.

Crazy fingers is like another version of Althea to me in that it feels heavenly and divine.

The music never stopped brings some funk fusion to the deads concerts that  usually only good lovin or dancin in the streets or maybe even lazy lightning could perform.

Lastly for everyone’s confusion the “What’s become of the baby” for this album is the Self titled album name Blues For Allah.

Why do I like this song? It shows the deads ability to turn anything into an enjoyable experience, at least that’s what I believe it is. It obviously has a greater meaning as does the entire album. I suppose it encapsulates that this album wasn’t just about music but something greater.",gratefuldead,1518376430,Stratengar,17,10,True,2018-02-11

"Question about upcoming ""Playing/Sand"" shows in Mexico","Hola everyone!  Playing in the Sand is coming up soon.  We have recently moved to Merida Mexico from Puerto Rico, hurricanes wiped us out in PR, anyway, it's about about a three or four hour drive to the shows from our house.  I understand the deal with the shows but figured I'd give this a shot. Does anyone know of anyway we could get admitted to just the shows?  For instance  an extra ticket  (or two?) from someone who can't make it?  (I don't know how or even if ??? that would work).  Willing to give most anything a try if anyone has any ideas and/or extra tix, or I don't know what . . . ???

Fully realize this is an Extremely Long Shot but maybe, just maybe, there's a way to see at least one of these shows that is happening in our ""backyard"".

We don't need accommodations (we live here) just Tix that will get us in.  Seems a shame to miss a show that is so close to home.

Whether we can get into the shows or not, if anyone wants to hang out afterwards we'd love to invite you come hang out with us.  Merida is a very cool town, lots of arts and music and pyramids less than an hour away.

General Discussion: The Vault,"Newer (year or two) head. I have a decent idea what ""The Vault"" is, but I have a specific question about it. But rather than make such a limited post, I figured I'd open it up more. Feel free to discuss what we know about the vault, good resources for info about the vault, etc. 


My specific question is this: Does anyone know or is there good reason to believe there is any significant high quality film/video of pre-hiatus shows that are as yet unreleased? 

The impetus for this question comes from LST. I really loved that section covering the first European tour and failed attempt to create a doc about it. That smooth segue into the beginning of Casey Jones from one of those shows was very cool. And, from the looks of it, it seems as though there exists some high quality film with audio for at least some of that tour (before the documentarians fell down the acid wormhole). 

Obviously we have a lot of pro shot concert footage from all eras, but most of it is, understandably, from the final 5-10 years of the band. And considering the band seems to have had a weird prescience when it comes to the documentation of their body of work I just have to get everyone's thoughts on the possibilities. 

Thanks everybody. Best sub on Reddit. ",gratefuldead,1518465159,eatthebear,11,13,True,2018-02-12

I listened to Two from the Vault yesterday and was surprised at how good it was.

That’s it for the other one would be the main highlight of the show for me because of how crazy almost very part is played.

The dark star-&gt; st Stephen-&gt; the eleven was magical and hypnotic.

I usually skip schoolgirl and death don’t have no mercy. Both make me uncomfortable, although I do like Death don’t have no mercy because it fits well with the Ego Death theme early Dead has.

The lovelight is chaotic and powerful.

Bobby's Yellow Dog Story,"Now what I think I'll do, is I'll take this opportunity to tell y'all a story. 'Cause y'all haven't heard it yet. And it goes like this:

There was a fellow, and he had a dog, a pet dog. And he used to walk his dog around, every now and again. And anyway, well, it was a hot summer day and he walking his dog, and he thought he'd stop off at the bar and have himself a beer. And he did just that. He walked into the bar, and he walked up to the bar. And he put his change on the bar, and he said to the bartender, ""I'd like a glass of beer.""

And the bartender said, ""Certainly, Sir, coming right up.""

Meanwhile, while he was waiting for his beer, he looked down the bar and there was this fellow sitting down the bar with a big black slick mean-looking dog. Now the fellow down the other side of the bar, with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog, said ... nothing. But the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog looked down the bar at the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog, and said ""hey that sure is an ugly little dog you got there, mister. All short fat squat ugly and yellow.""

Well the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog said to the guy with the big black sleek mean-looking dog ""yeah, well he may be ugly but he sure can fight.""

And the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog said to the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog, ""Yeah?""

The guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog said, ""Yeah.""

So they decided they'd take them both out back behind the bar and let them fight it out. ""I'll put a fiver on mine. You put a fiver on yours. Winner take home the bucks.""

They figured that was a good idea and they did just that. They took them out the back and they let them fight it out. And the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog just kicked you-know-what out the big black slick mean-looking dog. And when the fight was over and the big black slick mean-looking dog was over in the corner licking his wounds, the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog was hopping around, the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog allowed as, yeah, the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog sure could fight. But ... ""I never seen a dog look like that before, all short fat squat little ugly and yellow. What kind of dog is that anyway?""

And the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog said to the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog, ""Yeah, well he used to be an alligator before I cut his tail off and painted him yellow.""",gratefuldead,1518536518,s12scarper,5,44,True,2018-02-13

&gt; This is a great little gem to have.... This song was such a theme for Jerry in the later years. I absolutely love this song, and it was one that I was really hoping they would have laid down in studio. I think they could have really made this into something amazing.. There are a few live versions that show a hint of how incredible a song it was. Just list to 6-8-1992 at the Richfield Coliseum - my all time favorite live cut of this song. Jerry goes nuts at the end!!
As much as Jerry hated to write songs (by his own admission), when he nailed it...he really nailed it.

Grateful Discussion 20!: 8/27/72 Sunshine Daydream Veneta,"Why am I adding a Discussion for a show that has everything that can be said about the show already in a subreddit where it most assuredly has had everything said about it?

Because I want to that’s why. Anyways I’ll be talking about every single official release from the Dead that I can, and everything I see in relation this this subreddit.

I’ve been listening to this concert again recently. Usually the only time I visit this one again is for either the Playin or the Dark Star-&gt; El Paso, but one day I decided to listen to the whole show ago for fun.

I can tell how much I missed it. This is the show next to Europe 72 and 7/8/78 that got me into the Live Grateful Dead a year or two or three ago, I supposed I wouldn’t be a Grateful Dead if I had a great memory around those times. 

So what makes this entire show special? Not just the one or two definitive songs on here, but the entire premise of the show in my opinion. This show fully represents the type of music the Dead make: Americana

The Grateful Dead are the most American band I can name, even their most popular symbol is Red white and Blue/Indigo.

So why is it so talked about? The LSD, The Freedom, and most importantly the Set List.

It truly is liberating to be listening to music one moment in nature and then the next moment you are in space and get shot back down to Texas in a cowboy song. Then the whole sunshine daydream/sugar magnolia song plays and you are back in nature.

I’ll be honest though, not sure why they named the concert after Sugar Magnolia and not the Playin or the Dark Star.",gratefuldead,1518544946,Stratengar,44,2,True,2018-02-13
2/13/70 more than just another day in GD history,"2/13/70 is widely viewed as one of the top shows of all time. The dark star is top notch. 

On a personal note it’s the first show I discovered through statistics: 

As a young head in the 1980s I managed to get myself a copy of dead base II, an encyclopedia of dead shows and set lists, which had some survey data. 2/13/70 was ranked as both the best show and the best dark star. 

This was really helpful to a young collector. Prior to that knowing which shows were good was very word of mouth. 

It wasn’t like archive where you can look at star ratings or views. There were some taper bbs services but the survey data in dead base II, which was reasonably extensive, gave me something to study and a few things to hunt for. It helped me become a better tape collector. 

I had to have 2/13/70. 

Eventually I found someone willing to do a trade through the mail and was on my way. It’s been 30 years so I don’t remember how I finally closed the loop and got my copy, but I still remember seeing 2/13/70 at the top of two lists and looking it again and again as I re-read dead base, listening to my growing collection. 

So on this day I’m grateful for a few things: the music, the community, and how technology has made it even easier to find new gems. 

And given the position of this show in dead base 30 years ago it’s probably worth a special mention beyond the enjoyable “on this day in history” posts.

"TIL: ""That's it for the other one"" is really a 4 part suite","**That's It For The Other One** composed and written by Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and Bill Kreutzmann.

I. Cryptical Envelopment (Garcia vocals)
II. Quodlibet For Tender Feet (Instrumental)
III. The Faster We Go, The Rounder We Get (Bobby vocals)
IV. We Leave The Castle 

&gt; ""The song, which the Dead frequently dedicated to Owsley and which some have suggested deals with the persecution of the acid chemist, opens with a series of serious, but pleasantly melodic verses sung by Garcia over Pigpen's liturgical organ line and Garcia's florid acoustic guitar... The tune continues to tell the tale of this ill-fated individual until the melody fades and Kreutzmann's and Hart's drums set up the relentless chugging rhythm of the next section, sung by Weir, which eulogizes Prankster Neal Cassady (who died in Mexico in early 1968 under slightly mysterious, possibly drug- related circumstances), and attempts to verbalize, to a degree, psychedelic euphoria. Abruptly, that song closes and the music returns to the original theme sung by Garcia.""

Did the Dead have a good light show before the 90's?,"I'm a big fan of lights at shows, and just general aesthetics overall, and think they can make a good show great. It's something that I always look forward to when seeing certain bands, especially Phish. But I've never heard much about the Dead. I know that Candace Brightman was the designer for the Dead for many years, if not all of them, but I've haven't found much about what her designs were like. I know that for most of the Dead's tenure the technology wasn't there like it is today, and furthermore, that the capabilities of cameras wasn't there to capture what it was like so I'm curious to know from fans that may have experienced shows, particularly prior to the 90's. I've seen videos from the later years and I can see that they had pretty a pretty significant setup but can't tell much from the early to mid years.

"Playin' in the Sand Setlist Contest - Free Entry, win $30!","Since most of us couldn’t make it to Mexico for Playin’ in the Sand, I’m hosting a free setlist concert for the shows!  I’m putting up $30 cash money for the winner to stream one of the shows on the Appendix tour later in the month.  Or at least that’s what I would do with the money 😊
 
Entries are due before tomorrow’s concert starts in this thread.  Let me know if I missed any songs.  Good Luck!
 
Rules
For each concert, select 5 songs for set one, 5 songs for set two, and 1 song for the encore.  That’s a total of 33 songs, no repeating.  Points will be awarded if you select the song to be played in the correct set of the correct concert.  If your selection includes the set opener or closer, you will be awarded a bonus point for each.  If you select the encore correctly, you will be awarded double the songs point value!
 
Songs D&amp;C have already played before are worth between 2 and 15 points each, rarity taken into consideration -  if you nail a bust out that they’ve never played it’s worth 25 points.  Drums and Space are not included in the contest 😊  The point value for each song can be seen here:
 
https://i.imgur.com/iAxiMXM.jpg
 
Example: For the Thursday show you might select Set 1: Brown Eyed Women, Deal, Bertha, Big River, Sugaree, Set 2: Sugar Magnolia, The Wheel, Let it Grow, Hard Rain, He’s Gone, Encore: Brokedown Palace
 
The setlist then comes in as:
 
I: Feel Like a Stranger, Brown-Eyed Women, Ramble On Rose, They Love Each Other &gt; Little Red Rooster, Big Boss Man, Cumberland Blues, Casey Jones
II: Iko Iko, Deal, Help on the Way &gt; Slipknot! &gt; Franklin's Tower &gt; Drums &gt; Space &gt; The Wheel, Stella Blue &gt; Sugar Magnolia
E: Brokedown Palace
 
You would be awarded 15 points - Points would go as follows:

Set 1 – 2 points – Brown Eyed Women - 2

Set 2 – 7 points – Sugar Magnolia – 4 (3 for the song and a bonus point because it was the closer), The Wheel – 3.  Note no points are awarded for Deal because it was selected as part of Set 1.

Encore – 6 points – Brokedown Palace is worth 3 points, encore is worth double for a total of 6.

Dead &amp; Co Guessing Game Returns: Mexico Edition Night One 2/15/18,"Hey Guys!

If you can remember, someone won our guessing game in the final show of the tour (Austin) before Johnny's appendix burst. 

I said the game would return for the shows in Mexico and here I am. 

REFRESHER:

Guess the Opener, 2nd set closer and ENCORE(S) for tomorrow nights  Dead and Company show in Mexico. 

FOR THE ENCORE(S) You will need both songs if a double encore are played. 

Guessing all three gets you a donation to the archive.org in your name, or reddit gold! 

All guesses after tuning will be ignored. All edits after tuning will disqualify you. 

This is not meant to be easy so no ""This is impossible"" posts.

Lets see if someone can win before the end of the Mexico/Appendix Tour. If activity is really bad for this tour, ill shut the game down. 


If two users have the same 3 songs, and they WIN the one who posted first will win.

Here are my guesses

OPENER: Feels Like a Stranger

CLOSER: Not Fade Away

ENCORE: Ripple

GOOD LUCK TO ALL but most importantly, LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!!

Anyone gonna be in Mexico? Share your stories please!

I had the october 16-20 winterland soundboards for an eternity, but I lost them...and they're my favorite shows of all time. And it's not as easy just going to the archive to download anymore...

2018 for the dead,"Dead and co are off and they sound sososo good!
They are becoming something very special.  This is the DEAD
They sound better IMO then some 90s I have heard
and better than any reincarnation i have heard
but i have noticed since i have been listening to more 90s dead they play things slower or different just like the 90's. 
Anyway I am glad they are playing before summer so they get warmed up!, the scarlet &gt; fire last night was unbelievable (this was the first show of the run too) they already are warmed up they are HOT. John's playing is great.
The mix sounds a little different
John is less ""upfront""  anad his voice is getting way better. I dig it more, still hard to hear bass (you can hear it though!)

If you hate Dead and CO for whatever reason, check out last nights scarlet &gt; Fire! and fall tour.

i have 2 tickets already it'll be my 6th time seeing the dead after 2018 summer tour

I am excited and i hope everyone is too!
And i hope for that Europe tour

Must add: Yesterday sucked for everyone couch touring but I want to thank everyone for keeping good spirits and making it funny and still a good time , this is what we need :)!
hopefully they give us a freebie or something! or just get it right",gratefuldead,1518790925,GratefulFloyd1977,31,26,True,2018-02-16

Grateful Discussion 21: Dicks Picks 5,"Was on eBay scouting for more cheap Dicks Picks for my CD collection when I cam across DP 5 for about 30$. I had never listened to it and as someone that wanted to collect as many of these shows I went ahead and ordered it.

Listened to the whole thing yesterday and I’ve been very curious since then because not a lot of people mention DP 5 when Discussion good Dick Picks. They always talk about 12, 3, 8, and 25 a majority of the time even though there are some equally as good ones like 26 or 17.

Anyways 12/26/79 is the date for 5 and let me say it is surprisingly good and has some groovy versions of good songs.

H: Cold Rain and Snow, Big River, brown eyed woman, looks like rain, Alabama Getaway-&gt; promised land, he’s gone, all of the unnamed Jams, brokedown palace, around and around, shakedown street, and UJB.

The main highlights are the Alabama Getaway, Shakedown street, and the Uncle Johns band /w reprise.

Reason to listen to the show? Uncle Johns band by far. I would say this is one the best Uncle Johns bands I’ve heard next to Dicks Picks 8 it’s unusually very very spacey which isn’t usual for UJB either that or I never listen close enough to the song.

The shakedown is groovy and the ending segment when it goes back into UJB is fantastic.

The Alabama Getaway deserves a mention because of how hard it rocks during this show.",gratefuldead,1518806406,Stratengar,16,4,True,2018-02-16

We're watching the JRAD show from St. Louis, and the audio pauses very briefly several times per minute for a quick second. It's so annoying. I wish someone would let these bands mngmnt know that their choice of PPV streaming company is letting their fans down and they'd probably sell more PPV's if there was some type of quality control. A company that actually cared what they're putting out and when there's a problem, they fix it. There's got to be another company that can provide better, normal service you'd expect when you pay for PPV. Any entrepreneurs out there?? Here's an opportunity to start a PPV company that provides quality streams to its customers. Charge a little less - make it more affordable to the entire market your catering to and I'd bet you get a lot more customers/subscriptions and less pirating.

It is an absolutely incredible show. I can't pick a single low point. The estimated-&gt;eyes was particularly otherworldly. I was reading blog posts from people who attended the show, and viewing pictures of the event while listening, and it added a much deeper experience than I've had before. All I can say is wow.

**This show is the first Bertha, Greatest, Loser, Playin and Wharf Rat**
***  
**from archive.org:**  
&gt; My 3rd show - 1st I had the raw sound board and thought it was great then I had the DE-whined patched version of the sound board and thought it was great - but this is just wonderful - would be great if the rest of this run had the same source and sounded as good as this does. Once again Mr. Miller produces the definitive version of a show!  
  
and  
&gt; So many classic Dead tunes introduced.
The show for me was a bit hit and miss but overall it's high energy and compact (few lengthy jams). Probably a great place to start someone new to the Dead.
The GSET is interesting and was obviously a work in progress. The DS&gt;Wharf Rat&gt;DS is beautiful - don't let the shortness of this DS fool you, they take it into space and back.

Jammy/Experimental Shows from the Brent Era,"Hey all! I'm looking for recommendations for Brent-era shows that tend to be heavy on experimentation and improvisation. I typically gravitate towards the early days of the Dead, from the psychedelic 60's ""primal dead"" through the jazz odysseys of the early 70's, mostly for the level of open ended improvisation that occurred in that era. However I've been really digging Brent's playing lately--particularly the expanded sonic palette he brought as well as his willingness to ""play out"" more than Keith was often inclined to--and I really would like to hear his take on the deeper more experimental jams. 

The Cape Cod run from '79 is a great example of what I'm talking about, particularly the He's Gone-&gt;Caution Jam-&gt;The Other One-&gt;Drums from 10/27. From what I understand, '89-'90 is a great period for what I'm looking for, but I just don't know where to start. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",gratefuldead,1518987075,etherteeth,22,6,True,2018-02-18

"If you like the Grateful Dead, yer gonna love this, pt. 3: David Bromberg","You might have seen a post earlier today of a concert starring Steve Miller, John Mayer, Jorma Kaukonen, and David Bromberg, and you might've said, ""who he hell is David Bromberg?"" (As to the potential question, ""who is Jorma,"" we'll cover that in another ""If you like the Dead..."" segment.) David Bromberg is a guitarist, though he plays many other stringed instruments. He played with Dylan. On several of his early albums, he was backed by Jerry and several other members of the GD (hence his inclusion in this series). He also backed Jerry Jeff Walker back in his ""Bojangles"" glory days. He wrote the well-known song ""The Holdup"" with Beatle George Harrison. He left the music business awhile ago, and opened up a luthier shop in Wilmington, DE, where he specializes in collecting rare violins. Awhile ago, he returned to performing, and he is performing quite a bit, mostly on the East Coast. There's a wonderful PBS documentary about him called ""Unsung Treasure."" His first album has no GD related folks on it, but does have Norman Blake, Vassar Clements, Will Scarlett and other familiar names, and even Bob Dylan blowing harmonica on one track. His second album, ""Demon in Disguise,"" has Jerry, Phil, Billy, and the Godcheaux' on it. If you haven't heard it, stop reading now and go here (it's a classic!): https://youtu.be/WJVC8huyLLU (as often happens with youtube, this is the whole album, but not in order, and with additional material - still, it's all great). The album also has Tracy Nelson on it. Bromberg's third album, ""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" has the same GD folks, sans Donna. His third album, ""Midnight on the Water"" has no GD folks, but includes Dr. John, Maria Muldaur, Bonnie Raitt, and a lot of other well-known musicians. It's really a testament to how much other musicians appreciate Bromberg, even if he is not that well-known to the public. I would also recommend the following two albums, ""How Late'll Ya Play Til?"" and ""Reckless Abandon,"" though they have no GD players on them. His more recent material is also very good, with lots of famous collaborators. His music is a real mixture of styles - not only will he play a bluegrass song followed by a funky blues followed by ballad, but he'll put horns in a bluegrass song, or banjo in a funky blues. His eclecticism is what I love about him - that, and he can flat out play his ass off, and he's hilarious (I esp. love ""I'll Take You Back""), and if you get a chance to see him perform, DO IT.",gratefuldead,1515477420,ProfMoses,6,13,True,2018-01-09

We have a four-night, two-person package at the Barcelo Palace, which is meant to be the best accommodation on the site of the actual shows and gives you full access to the rest of the Barcelo resort.
The package is for two adults; check-in is Thursday 15 Feb and check-out is Monday 19 Feb. The room is a junior suite in the Barcelo Palace and has two double beds.
The total cost (ie, what we paid) is $5,107. You can find full details at: http://playinginthesand.com/the-resorts/barcelo-maya

We can put you in touch with the person we’ve been dealing with at CID Entertainment to verify all the details. It would simply be a case of taking on our package and once we given them the OK it will be transferred over to your names.
As we are in the UK, PayPal might be the easiest and fastest method of payment, but we can discuss.

Obviously, we are heartbroken not to be able to make it, and as we’d booked flights from England, this has turned into a bit of a financial disaster for us – so we’re hoping that some other heads can take advantage of our bad luck!

We heard almost 1500 Pink Floyd fans were busted at the Shrine the prior week, so we were smart enough to light up outside the venue (what a dork). Anyhow, they put us in a make shift jail in the bowels of the arena, harassed the crap out of us, wrote us citations, then let us go just before the show started. The Dead were Great!!! I loved them ever since :) Everyone around us smoked us out as we were weedless inside.... I love deadheads ;) This soundboard sounds good too. Thanks!

"GD influence on Miles' ""In A Silent Way""?","I was jamming Miles ""In A Silent Wa""y last night. The album was recorded Feb 18,1969 in NYC. The Dead were playing Fillmore East Feb 11 &amp; 12. A lot of tonal and sonic similarities. A year later, they would share the stage at the Filmore West, with Miles jamming Bitches Brew material to a transfixed audience of heads. 

Which begs the question: Could Uncle Bobo (Bill Graham) have brought Miles to the GD shows at the Filmore East in 69? I was a little faded while listening but at moments, I could really hear the Dead's meandering tonality in ""Shhh"". ",gratefuldead,1515959917,mcgmcgmcg,7,6,True,2018-01-14

Searching for barn-burners akin to the Hard to Handle/Casey Jones/Lovelight from 8/6/71,"I'm might ramble a bit so I'll put my concrete questions for you guys in bold towards the bottom of the post. 


I should preface by saying that I've been a totally converted Deadhead since I was introduced ~3 years ago. I thought I had a pretty good grasp of the band and their history. I considered myself primarily a 77' guy, but I also really dug 89' and mid 70's stuff. 


A couple days ago I discovered the Relisten app, took two tabs, and listened to 08/06/71 (the *epic* Rob Bertrando AUD), 02/18/71 (SBD), and parts of 06/24/71 (Ken/Judy Lee AUD) for the first time. Halfway through the 08/06/71 show, the *drums* was so fucking good (and I'm *not* much of a drums fan) that I had to lay down, and when Phil launched into The Other One I immediately knew this was the greatest show I'd ever heard. In fact, it was bar none the greatest musical experience/discovery of my life, and over the past few days this feeling of awe and excitement hasn't diminished a bit. Here I had been listening to the Dead pretty much nonstop for a couple years and was still able to discover shows that not only became my favorite shows but reinvented my entire concept of the Grateful Dead. Furthermore, this came at a perfect time because this semester I'm starting up a band with my deadhead guitarist friend and we're trying to put a set-list together of high-energy songs for house shows. As you can imagine, with this context, 70'/71' was... epiphanous. 70'/71' Dead sounds like ""house show Dead"" (in a good way). High energy, clean playing, wild jamming, amazing stage presence, great crowds.

I'm going to try to explain what I liked most about these shows, and if you guys have any recommendations for shows to check out, good articles about this time period, or even other groups to look into based on what I like, that would be awesome. 

Here are some songs that I'm looking for high-energy versions of (I am using headyversion, of course, but I find that sometimes headyversion is so biased towards particular releases that a lot slips through the cracks):

* Cumberland Blues

* Saint Stephen

* Hard to Handle (holy SHIT this is a good song that I had no idea about)

* Turn on Your Lovelight

* Casey Jones

St. Stephen is, if played right, almost guaranteed to be a banger. Cumberland Blues has very fun vocals and has a very easy yet wild minor jam section that would be awesome to play. Viola Lee Blues has a similar Gminor jam. Hard to Handle and Lovelight are great because of all the cool different jams that Jerry and Bob make. *Groovy* jams. Really funky. I love it when the Dead get FUNKY. Lovelight especially seems to go through four or five distinct ""phases"" with different main riffs. Those two songs make you move your butt, and that's a big plus! Not to mention that, unlike railroads or Cumberland mines, the topic of sex doesn't age. Everyone (especially Jerry and the drums IMO) is *tight*. Much tighter than even 77'. That musical tightness + bootie shakin funk + driving energy is what I need. 

With this in mind,

**What are your favorite high-energy versions of the songs I listed, or songs you think I'd like based on my reasoning?**

**What are good full-shows from this era to check out?** Bonus points if there are any other killer AUD's... I love a good AUD.

**Miscellaneous: (1) If any of you are musicians that have advice for learning this material, that would be awesome. (2) If you guys know of any good articles/books/reviews from this period that you recommend, let me know about those too.**

Thanks guys!

**from archive.org:**  
&gt; I've just gone through much of 1968 and for me that was the year that the Dead grew the most. Gone were the garage band boogy of 1966 and the awkward gangly period of 1967. I regard 68 as the period from childhood to adolescence. But 1969 was when the band hit maturity. Jerry became god-like on the guitar this year and the band was right there with him. Check out the Dark Star, the band and especially Jerry have hit the next level. The exception being Tom Constanten who hasn't quite found his voice with the band yet, if he ever did. But his keys whether for good or ill aren't prominent in the mix. I don't know why they replaced Pigpen because Pig is a much better and more natural, soulful and rhythmic keyboardist with the Dead than Tom and his over-thought keys ever were. I guess because of Pigpen's drinking? In any case there's any easy sort of grace and splendor to the band's playing on this show. It grooves seamlessly. Except for Cosmic Charlie which is a total trainwreck. What the hell though, there's a first time for everything and this was the first Cosmic Charlie. This show is very well recorded (Micky's over loud bass drum notwithstanding) and any issues with timing have to do with the band playing Lovelight at a slower than usual tempo, not the tape or rather the pitch correction. The vocals and instrumentation sound exactly correct, especially the snare drums. Had this show been incorrectly pitched, any variance in the drums and vocals would be obvious. Nice job on the crossfades to reduce the cuts also. This is a great show in a year of great shows. I can't imagine what it must have been like for the audience other than a transcendent experience.

Goooood stuff.

&gt; Thanks charlie for some uncirculated tapes. Alas as I have listened up too Beat It On Down The Line, Keith's spinnet piano playing really takes the band down. The once superb keyboard player sounds totally out of touch with Jerry and the others.If he was in any outfit but the dead he probalby would have been gone after 1978. Brent really allowed the to shread past The limitations of poor cohesivness. I hate to be negative it is just very hard not to notice. Good Night and Good luck.

"For those who play 'HQ', anyone else notice Scott's dead references every night?","My sister recently got me playing this app called 'HQ'.

Last night there was a question about wine, and he started singing ""We can share the women we can share the wine"". The night before there was a question about how many wheels are on a certain vehicle, and he started singing ""The wheel is turning and it can't slow down"". The night before that there was a question about the book ""Winds in the Willow"" and well, you get the point.

Just thought I'd share. I think this guy is their main host and he just came back from vacation or something, almost won last night so I'll keep coming back for the GD quotes and maybe win sometime lol.",gratefuldead,1516284395,WatcherOTWall,6,13,True,2018-01-18

&gt; Poor Jerry, his voice just gives out here and there from what, not really sure, didn't get a chance to ask him! He still does his best pulling some of the vocals off. But at least his heart and soul is still flowing through out his performace. Anyway, the sound, at times gets wierd, and the overall show is quite mellow (not that is is a bad thing). I still enjoyed listening to this show as well as the others in this year. As I have been told, that 77 is one of their better years. I am amazed to find thus far (showing my newb here), how many songs have been repeated in the tour. As for me, I don't think this is a bad thing, as each show seems to render a slightly different version of how they did it before.

What to expect at my first dead show?,"I have been fortunate enough to receive tickets to see the dead and co in New Orleans in February. 

I am only 22, and have been listening to the dead for about 2 years now so I definitely consider myself a “noob” and am not afraid to admit it. I found their music at a very dark, mistake filled time in my life and it has helped me move on from that, I will never forget the power of the dead’s sounds. 

I have watched so many clips on YouTube from past shows; that my wonderful mother was nice enough to gift me 4 tickets to the show for Christmas as a surprise gift. 

I am thrilled and can’t wait to experience my first show, but what can I expect other than a groovy night of music and great people? As far as the psychedelics scene and drug use go, are they lenient and just let us heads do what we want unless there is a serious problem?

Heavy security? Are they 420 friendly inside these venues? Any recommendations or tips for necessities to bring into the show, or do’s and dont’s?

Thanks in advance!

One of THE best Casey Jones, and OMSN played as it should be...fast, rockin', no DJG, and lots 'o' Phil. Honorable mention to It Hurts Me Too. It's easy to sometimes take these shows/songs for granted, but if you're into this time period, don't pass on this one. It's a keeper. 5 stars, to average things out a bit.

&gt; Magic in the Fish Tank
This was my second show in a great venue that felt more like a fish tank than a stadium. Zon's roommate went to a department store outlet to score tickets and got 5th row center. I remember thinking I was watching the band as close as if they were in my own living room. During the super hot Cassidy I was blown away that they could take a jam so far out there and then baffled that they could somehow bring it back so perfectly. I had never heard any band do anything like that and that was the moment I got hooked on the Live Dead experience. My only other memory of that night was my ground score of a british candy tin full of the dankest buds I ever saw. I traded half for a hit of bunk X the next night. This is a great sounding tape, BTW.

&gt; Down the old Valley Road. A beautiful day in the desert winding down the best year on tour since the early eighties (those old enough and on tour will agree). Jerry always played better when Hornsbee was with them and today was no different. The Valley Road that noone knew ended up rocking the hardest for the first set. Dust was flying, heads were dancing, and dreads were flailing. Thanks Jerry for the Scarlett/Fire and fun in the sun.

&gt; Guess who was right behind me?
First I want to say I'm revising this, because I want to apologize since I noticed that for some strange reason this is appearing twice, why I have no idea! And I just noticed that about the reviewer on the next show. I sure hope this doesn't come out a third time now; or perhaps hopefully, it will fix itself, in which case you won't know what the heck I'm talking about. But that's better than seeing it over again!
Wow how can I forget, I haven't heard this in quite a while, since my tapes are in storage. Not to brag, but guess who was right behind me during the first set on the lower mid-front left side facing the stage; none other than Ornette Coleman himself!
So when the set ended, I introduced myself, and said that I'd seen him before at the Palace in Hollywood, and heard the tape of him with Grateful Dead in Oakland. To which he seemed enthused that he was recognized in the dark, with a semi-general admission crowd. Naturally, I expressed that it would be great if he would play with them. He probably was planning on it anyway, even if I didn't talk to him!
Airto, was his usual greatness. I was fortunate enough, to have seen every, (besides for most of the Hamza El-Din and Olatunji appearances,(I held Babba's hand, (since he was blind), backstage on New Year's))), Airto appearance with Grateful Dead, except one, in addition to other times with other folks at jazz fests, on his own, and the first Planet Drum show at the Marin Vet. Center. As well as on the second Planet tour!
I remember Easy Answers to be amazing, or was that other run of shows they did here at the L.A. Sports Arena or both, (I love that tune, but even so)? I have to listen again, to those as well, with Branford Marsalis in '94. I'll write more later. You'll dig this I hope!

in oakland-alameda stadium, next to the Rock Med area, adjacent to a large walkway down, just off the floor. Someone was thoughtful enough to equip the room with two speakers amd a scene was born! This was the night that I truly discovered the magic of dancing with other people. We had a little secret room all to ourselves, for a whole show...a whole run of shows in fact, but this night, with a 6 song pre drums was the one to remember.

A friendly criticism of JRAD,"I've never seen JRAD live (really want to!) but I've been blown away by some of their jams on YouTube.  After binge watching some of their stuff I can say I love their energy and ability to reinvent, reinterpret, and breathe new life into the Dead's catalog.  That being said, I must admit I pick up on a hint of rehearsal in their music (for example, band members silencing their instruments abruptly to allow for premeditated solos).  I didn't notice it at first, but once I did I have to say it sounds a little less authentic, flowy and improvisational than say D&amp;C or DSO.  Still top notch jams and energy unmet by perhaps even the Grateful Dead in their prime (OK, maybe an overstatement), but I wish they could loosen up a tad if that makes any sense.",gratefuldead,1512892957,hankkush,29,6,True,2017-12-10

&gt; Dayum folks! Step right up for a masterpiece of a recording/matrix and a spectacular window on Americana circa 1979. The commentary in the crowd, ""We didn't pay 11 bucks to see you standing in a room!""; the polka vibe and spectacular detail in the vocals really make this a must have. 

From the get go CRS kicks off a solid shining performance. Garcia chills with his inspired precision. Clapper's choice with Scarlet drifts into a staccato typewriter assault in Fire building into an incredible fury before the Scarlet reprise. After that, it is a blur of gems that build to another frenzy in trucking' that has the whole place goin' apeshit. All that before drums! Spaceship then launches into Wharf Rat, melting to the core. The energy somehow continues into a blistering JBG.
Of course US B's is the capper for the American Experience

**from archive.org:**  
&gt; Yet another fantastic show from 1988, which I consider one of the strongest of them all. Looking at the show on paper it looked like a mellow, laid back run through for the southern California crowd; just a tune-up for New Year's. Boy was I wrong about that! This show has energy like a MSG show, the crowd is fired up and the band delivers the good in kind. The transition from China&gt;Rider is absolutely a must listen! A nice audience recording that gives a good vibe of what it was like in the building that night.

&gt; At first. The sound quality of the recording grates on you, but halfway thru Lovelights you know you've struck paydirt. This is a spectacular version with a haunting counter harmony that this reviewer has never heard from a Lovelights. I especially enjoyed the version of He Was A Friend of Mine. Nice singing. King Bee is also special for me because this was another not oft played song and Blue Ron roughs it up with his best growl. T.C. is prominent in the mix and the entire band is well-presented, balance-wise. The rest of the show is dynamite with one of the finest, most melodic of Feedbacks.

The playin jam by Garcia is outrageous. It is not '73-'74 no but it does not dissapoint in the slightest. The Shakedown is clearly a set saver- only Terrapin or maybe an eyes could have saved this set from apppearing lame. BUt the playin Jam is worth the listen at the very least. It sounds like slipknot.

&gt; Unlike apparently, the other two reviewers, I was at this show. Although some of the versions were not that great, I was very happy with the song list, as well as the day before. At least the rarer tunes, (besides those), I'd agree to some extent, ie. I'd been yawnin' at the generic tunes for years by this point, therefore virtually any rare/different tunes were welcome to me. Obviously we have different taste. However it's been a while since I listened to this and I haven't many times. Moreover, I was quite lucky given my circumstances to be able to attend any shows at this time, hence that could skew my perception. So I'm going to recheck it!

Volume of Recordings Being too Low,"I figured you all may know the answer or a way around my problem. I have a strange phenomena that I can't explain. If I listen to a recording off of archive.org (say a grateful dead concert) in...

* my car (Honda Accord 2012) either through USB which has the mp3s or through phone using an AUX
* my work truck Ford F150 (from phone through AUX)
* my LG TV connected to JBL LSR305's
* my Samsung Galaxy S7

the volume of certain recordings can be pretty low. So low that I struggle to reach the volume I desire. However, with my Dell Latitude E6440 Laptop and my skullcandy headphones, this problem doesn't seem to happen. I don't understand why the problem never seems to occur (I can get the volume of any recording/show/concert/video way louder than I would ever want) on my laptop but does everywhere else. My JBL LSR305's for most youtube videos can be REALLY LOUD. but when I switch to certain archive.org recordings (not all), I have this volume issue. If I do the same thing on my laptop with headphones, no such problem. I don't think it is merely a utilization of headphones compared to speakers as the *difference* between one recording and another disappears on my laptop but not elsewhere.

Does anyone have an idea as to why this may be? Additionally, does anyone know of an app that I could use to increase the signal or baseline volume of a track/recording.

GIFT FOR A DEAD HEAD,So I’m trying to find a cool T-shirt for a friend of mine who loves the Grateful Dead. She had one that is now in tatters and unfortunately has to be retired.

The show is fantastic too, but the sound blows me away.

I got my presale code. I entered it, and scored 3 tickets for one of the radio city shows. I was fucking stoked because I never get lucky on ticketmaster.

I get all the way to the 'place order' button, and click it..... 'process cannot be completed'. I try again.... 'you have exceeded the ticket limit'. I tried 3 or 4 more times before my timer hit 0.

set list archive,
on this day in GD history,
SBD links, although that could get tricky,
upcoming shows for Phil &amp; Friends, Bobby, Dead &amp; Co, etc.
upcoming shows for the bigger cover bands like JRAD and DSO.

and then user-generated content, like:
dead cover bands/gatherings in your town,
message boards,
groups of people who follow tour together,
photos from shows,
ticket/recording trading.


maybe it will never exist, but it's fun to conceptualize, and any input you all have would be great!

&gt; There still is a little hiss, and the vocals are a touch high in the mix, but this terrific little show has its moments! The eighteen minute Playin' is dynamite, alternating between Jer's edgy themes and some shimmering rushes from Weir and Keith. But the highlight is certainly the unique Jam which starts only minutes into a rough Truckin' and develops into a slow/smokey theme during which Jer is holding and bending notes a la Carlos Santana while Phil is backing into some very cool notes that sound like implosions! The tension carries through into the excellent Dark Star which, at least up to the first verse, can hold its own against the best from 1972.

&gt; This was the Dead's first trip to Birmingham and my first Dead concert. Opening with ""Promised Land"" seemed sweet enough, but then they got to ""and the 'hound broked down and left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham,"" and the place went nuts. You can hear the surge in the cut, but it was really dramatic live. A great little rock 'n roll moment. By the way, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, NPR posted a list of songs of the Civil Righrts Movement. ""Promised Land"" was on it. I'd never thought of this song in that context, but I've always loved the cross-country journey and its take on the American Dream. Seeing this song on that NPR list reminded me of this concert and it occurred to me to poke around on the internet for it. Lo and behold, here it was. ""I need a miracle every day.""

For Immediate Release - Tasks for Tickets,"

For immediate release:
Former Grateful Dead members announce “Tasks for Tickets” program


In what seems to be a tacit response to recent complaints by long-term “Deadheads” that ticket prices for the upcoming “Bobby and Phil” reunion shows are beyond reach for loyal fans, the Grateful Dead organization today announced a novel program that will allow financially strapped fans to obtain tickets. 

Starting January 1, would-be concert goers can apply for tickets using time and effort instead of cash. The arrangement is simple- the band members and associated staff have compiled a list of “to-do” items, and applicants who can accomplish tasks and check items off the list will receive tickets in compensation. 

Band members Phil Lesh and Bob Weir announced the new program today at a press conference held at Lesh’s music venue and restaurant “Terrapin Crossroads” in San Rafael.


Said guitarist Bob Weir of the “Tasks for Tickets” program: “You know, I’ve heard people say that they gave up their best years to follow us, and now they feel abandoned. Well, I know the feeling… I spent my twenties, thirties and forties in the back of a goddamn rental van shuttling between Holiday Inns and shit-holes like Hampton Fucking Coliseum… Then, when I finally got back to Marin, I’d be told that after venue fees, insurance, travel and payroll and expenses for what seemed like way too many hippies that, I guess, were our employees, I had like eight hundred bucks. So then we had to leave and do the whole wretched thing over again.” 
Lesh added: “Yeah, that’s right… So, when my buddy Jerry –you may remember him- died trying to keep that shit-show rolling, we kinda said to ourselves ‘Oh, fuck… What did we do??’. I mean, we really pissed in the Cheerios killing that guy. So, we took a break and laid off all those hippies. We kept some of the bikers around though. I mean, they work their asses off and are pretty self-sufficient. None of them ever even asked for healthcare, and they beat the shit out of union guys just for fun. But, I digress… So, eventually, Bobby and I, we hired real professionals to handle our financial matters. 

We both wrote a bunch of songs and we still get royalties. Also, we are pretty much sober, so we are able to kind of be productive. We made some money, finally, and Bobby bought Sweetwater Music hall and I built Terrapin Crossroads. We were feeling pretty good about the whole thing… After all, Bobby saved this really historic old venue, and I preserved an old building and we created a lot of jobs and were able to continue playing music for people and all this stuff… Funny thing, though, is people were mad at us. One guy said something on Facebook about wanting to burn my place down because I was charging sixty bucks for tickets. They also called Bobby an “Elitist” because Mill Valley wouldn’t let people camp out in fucking micro-busses and let their rabid dogs roam the streets biting children and impregnating show-bred Shih-Tzus. So, finally, we just said ‘Fuck it’ and did this whole Soldier Field thing. Well, that shit was POPULAR, and then people started acting even more crazy… They were mad as hell and saying stupid shit all over the internet. Like, criticizing Bobby for sending his girls to private school and stuff… The promoter and the venue saw what was up before we did, and man, they were ON IT! Like, tickets were hard to get and they cost a shitload, but whatever. It’s 2017 and there are still a lot of mouths to feed. Anyhow, all this negativity and I just wasn’t going to play anymore. I bought a $700,000 Porsche and a boat and some other shit, and man, having nice stuff is EXPENSIVE. I mean that boat costs me money just sitting there. I gotta get guys to put on SCUBA gear and scrape barnacles, I gotta insure it, I gotta pay for the slip, or whatever they call it, and all this other stuff. So, anyhoo, we made a damn FORTUNE on the Dead50 deal, and then Weir hooks up with that Mayer dude, and they’re making EVEN MORE scratch, plus Mayer can still bring in groupies who are in their late-teens!! I’m real happy hanging at my club and playing most of the time, but man, I gotta get a piece of all this popularity… I’m gonna make some damn money, and Weir is right there with me, I think…”


Weir chimes in with his famous “googly eyes” and a sneer, “You bet your ass I am… I didn’t fucking tell anyone to spend their youth running all over the goddamn world watching us play our music! You think when we were kids we just fucked off? Fuck no. We played, wrote music, played, wrote music, made records, played and played some more. We were fucking focused and serious and worked like madmen. And while we weren't doing that we were working to move society forward maybe a little bit. We had a work-ethic and an ethos. We didn't spend our time bitching about what we were owed or what we couldn't get. If you didn’t go to school or bother to learn a trade because you were too busy walking around the parking lot at Alpine Valley with your index finger in the air like some kind of dickhead, well, that’s not my problem. You want to go to the show? You can hand-polish my new Italian marble steps at my mansion in Kentfield. But I am sure-as-shit going to blindfold you on the way there. Neo-hippie bullshit motherfuckers…”
The program is expected to be extremely successful.

I have past life memories of being in SF and 710 Ashbury,"Had a dream... On a street corner tripping balls freaking out a bit. On the corner of Haight and Masonic, (I know now since I visited there in this incarnation), thinking to myself, ""safe place that way"" towards Ashbury. See myself walking up set of stairs going up to the back of the house and going inside. No lights on inside and orange knit curtains filtering light so it was darkish but felt warm and safe for a tripping mind. 
When I visited SF my friend made friends with a nice fellow that was renting Janice's old downstairs apt and invited me to visit. I got super crazy feelings seeing the staircase was real. Anyone connected to that house back in the day to help me sort out who I was? I play every manner of musical instrument and improvise without  challenge. If you were there and want to help please PM me? Maybe you remember me. I must have died around '79. 

Also, I remembered being at Golden Gate Park with the hills and talking with someone wearing a brown leather suit. (Visiting there I recognized the landscape from my vision. By Janice's tree.) Is there anyone that iconicly wore a brown leather suit?

"Just started reading ""No Simple Highway"" by Peter Richardson","Not too far along yet but really enjoying it so far. There's a paragraph on page 73 that resonates with me.

""Fear also figured in Garcia's attraction to psychedelics...One anthropologist noted that most of the commentary on the Grateful Dead has lacked a sufficient consideration of fear, and it was no accident that many early listeners cited terror as their first reaction to the Dead's music. Several frightening aspects of the psychedelic experience, including the dissolution or fluidity of ego boundaries contributed to that effect. The antique *danse macabre* iconography also expressed a basic fascination with the darker side of life that lay behind the band's name. In this sense, skeletons with roses weren't adornments, but rather central elements in the Dead's project and it's reception"".

I love the ""sunshine and rainbows"" but its the other, darker more raw feelings/experiences that the music and culture invokes that originally appealed to me. 

What are everyone else's thoughts?

The GD Guitarists - all 3 of them,"/u/MrDanger made a comment the other day about Phil's bass playing on the 9-11-73 Dark Star. That got me thinking about the 3 GD guitarists, and I count 3 guitarists because even though Phil is the bassist, that's only part of the time. Most of the time it's as if there were 3 guitarists, Jerry playing point at the higher end of the spectrum, Phil playing counterpoint at the lower end and Bobby filling out the rest. In the same way that Bobby's really, as Sammy Hagar put it ""the second guitarist"" as opposed to a traditional rhythm guitarist, Phil is anything but a traditional bass player (a spot you see Oteil occupy in Dead and Company).

Anyway when the three got going it was a sight to behold. This show https://archive.org/details/gd78-01-07.sbd.cotsman.17806.sbeok.shnf shows it perfectly. Strange show in ways - Jerry was down with laryngitis so other than Sunrise they're all Bobby songs. The next night was similar. But you'll hear Phil in all his glory right through this thing.

And of course the Supplication here shows it in spades:

A long-standing confusion between this show and the Owsley benefit held at Winterland on 12/23/70, continues to infect GD tapelists.

&gt; First things first, if you are 'judging' this performance you are absolutely obligated to recall the context: third of the three most significant performances since the four shows in 1975, the most notable of those being 8.13.75 (Great American Music Hall), although my personal favorite is 9.28.75 from Golden Gate Park. But I digress...My point is the trio of shows in December of 1986 that culminates in this 12.17.86 performance are historical, even by Grateful Dead standards. Jerry's return to health and to performing after collapsing into a coma in the summer of 1986 was the backdrop for these shows, and it is no exaggeration to say that the 'Grateful Dead' took on an entirely new meaning by the time the band left the stage after the final encore.

&gt; Out of the three aud show available, this one is the best sounding to my ears. And it's a groovy show to boot. Good, solid playing all the way through. I could really care less about ""best ever this"" or ""best ever that."" Blah, blah, blah. A good Dead gig is a good Dead gig. Period. This one's worth a download. Take it with you on a road trip. Peace and hang loose.

&gt; We got there early, just to make sure to get a good seat in the BACK of the arena. We were sitting half way up the concourse smack in the middle.
I think the mix was better there, and the light show was amazing. The entire arena was used for the light show, and if you sat anywhere else, you missed it! As always, it was a great atmosphere seeing the Dead at ""home"". Jerry was busy tuning his guitar for many of the songs in the first set, hence the sloppiness.

The Nola night shown in the light when I looked at it right,"Well.. Meant to write this a few weeks ago but got busy.. It was gonna be my first show to see any of the remaining members of the grateful dead live. I'm 35 from Houston and obviously they didn't play my city this fall but Nola was the easiest for me to attend. Been a Head since I bought the ""Phil Zone"" album in '99. Obviously, I was more than a little bummed BUT headed to see Hallelujah Hatrack tribute band that night at the Balcony Club for the ""after party"" concert and was blown away by the energy. French quarter late night, small bar club filled with Heads, we all wanted a taste of the magic we missed from the cancelled show.  Hallelujah!  The tribute band rocked my/our sox off!  I ended up hearing all the old standbys I was looking for at the show and more.  The vibe in that small bar was unlike anything I have ever experienced (granted I have never been to a ""show"" of the Dead (or any remaining members).  These guys got off work from their 9-5 and played their guts out to a crowd full of Heads that were so ""needy"" (myself included!) of a fix and they came through in the clutch.  At the end of the second set before the encore they played wharf rat and a young lady was in a trance like state near the stage.. It was beautiful.  Here is a small clip of the beginning of Scarlet/Fire (link below).  Wish I had more to do it justice but I was so busy jamming that I didn't want to waste the moment recording more than just a bit.  If you happen to be going to the makeup show in Nola or if you are nearby, you may want to lookout for these folks ""Hallelujah Hat Rack"".  Super cool people too, I congratulated them on the way out the door at 2am after they had been playing for over 3 hours and they had to get home to go to work the next day!  Ha!  That's what I call Deadacation!

**from archive.org:**  
&gt; It’s obvious that the “Here Comes Sunshine” was the swaying factor in Dick Latvala’s decision to release this night for the first released pick. It’s also the last stand of 1973, a year universality praised by many deadheads (and rightfully so!). It happens to be my favorite year, and I’m of the opinion that the Dead bade farewell to this year in fine fashion, although the previous night in Tampa deserves the nod for the stronger of the two shows. The aforementioned HCS is truly epic, and along with the versions played on 12/6, 11/30, 11/17 and 2/23/74, ranks among the very best. The last show of December is not actually an all around spectacular show, all told. Much of the first set is dialed in, save for the “Playin’”, and this version, while good, is nowhere near the best of the year. (For superlative stand alone versions look to the month of February, 3/16, 5/26, 7/1 &amp; 10/19.) The Second set, per usual, offers up more interesting sonic goods. The segue-wave involving “Truckin’-&gt;Nobody’s Fault But Min-&gt;Jam-&gt;Other One-&gt;Jam” is the undisputed highlight. The “Truckin’” itself is pretty uneventful, but the “Nobody’s Fault” is remarkable (best version of the year, imho), and the jam that is segues into is worth a listen or three. The “Other One” that follows is very lean, clocking in at under two minutes (Phil Lesh disallowed the inclusion of his bass solo before this night was released), then segues into one of the greatest “insect fear” meltdown jams of the 73/74 era. The jarring, yet thrilling waves of electronic crescendos hint at the upcoming “Seastones” section that would later grace or plague (depending on your tastes) summer and fall ’74 shows.

Dead and Co. VIP vs. Springsteen on Broadway,"I've been one who has quietly paid what it took to get into the building and be on the rail for some time now. Imagine my surprise, then, when I got my Fan Verified Code for ""Springsteen on Broadway, the extended Money Grab,"" via text message this morning, while I was on the horn with a client. It took me like 10 minutes to check my messages, and I was like ""Holy Fuckin Shit!"" I gotta get busy. So I opened my T(B)M account, found the dates for my birthday, 3/28. BAM! Would I like to spend $850 per seat or a mere $400 (for what is likely an obstructed view, or next to the fecking Ice Machine or bathroom door. I checked a bunch of other dates, and all the same. A respectable seat was $700!! Front row Mezzanine is what I wound up with. I was about to close out and say to hell with it, when my entrepreneurial spirit kicked me and said ""Hey, I can always sell them if I can't afford to actually attend because of something like, say, mortgage or taxes, or my monthly health insurance premium. ($900+!!) So, $1443 later, I have 2 front rows center for the Mezzanine, for the middle of April. I feel sick to my stomach! Looking on eBay, I'm seriously thinking I could flip these puppies and get myself to the Cancun Shows in February with a little luck. Or maybe a bunch of Neil Young shows - VIP - this Summer. I mean, I love the Boss, don't get me wrong. Hell, I was raised in New Jersey! But $721+ per seat with fees... who is the bigger money grab NOW? That doesn't even include a frickin poster!

Can we just all agree that a lot of very different people like the Grateful Dead?,"Lets keep the politics and the bullshit aside.

The Grateful Dead is an amazing sound and a lot of their songs can be taken in different ways, so it is very obvious that many people who dont agree with you, will at least agree with you on the Dead. 

This sub is about the music. The scene. The lifestyle. There is no reason for this sub to be clouded by political judgement, because thats not what the music means. 

Who cares if you're conservative or liberal, republican or democrat, Muslim or Christian, atheist or spiritual. At least we can all agree that the Grateful Dead is incredible.

From a Bassnectar fan,"I have been listening to the Dead for the past few years, but I think I got on the bus went I got to see them in Dallas and Austin a couple weeks ago for my first times. It was phenomenal, everything I have been listening from them all those past years clicked that weekend. It really was an amazing experience. I can talk forever about that weekend. I have been hungry for more shows since. 

Why I am posting is that I was curious on how many Dead fans are also Bassnectar fans? I figured there would be a few of us here. A lot of my basshead friends from Virginia are sons and daughters of Deadheads. Was just seeing how many of yall also like Bassnectar?

The First Time I Ever Heard of the Dead,"I was listening to *Cumberland Blues* earlier and it brought back memories of the first time I ever heard the Dead.  

In high school I used to ride to school with a guy in my neighborhood.  One day he played some music and I loved it and asked him to borrow the cassette so I could dub it and make my own copy.  The album was *Workingman's Dead*.  

This was the perfect introduction to the Dead for me because the songs there are straightforward and country-ish.  I was getting into classic rock big time through my Dad's album collection.

Anyway, I just had the cassette, not the case, and on the tape it said: Workingman's Dead / Workingman's Dead.  I went and told my friend that I had discovered a new band called ""Workingman's Dead"".  I was so naive I thought that was the name of the band.  No idea why the cassette was labeled in that way. 

My friend corrected me.  I was only remotely aware of the band at that time.  I was 15 years old.  I fucking loved the album, and to this day it remains my favorite Dead album, and *Cumberland Blues* is still in my top 5 Dead songs.  

It wouldn't be long before I had posters and would be spending my time drawing and tracing all the iconography like stealies,etc.  I wouldn't smoke pot for another 4 years. ",gratefuldead,1513818071,BuckRowdy,24,28,True,2017-12-20

I not only wanted to say how great the band is individually, but how they have done a great job creating bridges into other genres of music.

I can't believe how I am just now finding some of these musicians. I have heard of them, but haven't explored their catalog in detail. I've been on a binge with 'Miles Davis tribute to Jack Johnson' along with Herbie Hancock's 'Sextant', and have not been disappointed. It is honestly incredible, if you all have any suggestion's for a college kid in his 20's it would be much appreciated.

Man, I must admit, I rarely find myself listening to 90s Dead/JGB, but I stumbled upon this show this morning, and it hit me like a sack of bricks.

For maybe the first time, I'm really understanding the things I've heard/read in docs/memoirs about Jerry in these last years and having the sensation that I can truly hear/feel his life unfold as a narrative through his live performances. The progression is beautiful and heartbreaking all at the same time, and I'm thinking maybe I need to branch out from my typical 70s-era cave.

Naive deadhead looking for insight from my elders,"This is a follow up query from previous post inquiring on trippy habits of the GD... here's a quote from Jerry in rolling stone interview after inquiry related to Brent and being the new guy on the scene(despite 10 years of service).

 ""No, forget it. If you're looking for comfort, join a club or something. The Grateful Dead is not where you're going to find comfort. In fact, if anything, you'll catch a lot of shit. And if you don't get it from the band, you'll get it from the roadies. They're merciless. They'll just gnaw you like a dog. They'll tear your flesh off. They can be extremely painful"" 


I have lived loved lost and won again. Maybe I am still too naive too comprehend, will someone please help? I truly believe that the answer could extend beyond the GD and provide insight into the flawed self-defeating social mechanisms that have plagued civilized society for way too long now. I don't want to twist wit, I just want to know whats with that level of hostility and exclusivity that has separated many of us into like fucking rankings or some stupid shit?
Why do we tear down the people around us? Why do we emulate some of the same problems the society we mutually rebelled from does ? Tribalism is dated af yet still there are moments of division when it should be inclusion, on a deeper level. I beg us all dispel the voices in our minds that would lead us to turn on our brothers and our sisters by God.

I really don't think he sang it better than on 5/22, and the whole song just flows so well.. it's really beautiful. And on top of that it comes as the capper to 52 minutes of one of the finest pieces of music the dead ever strung together (in the form of: Estimated&gt;Eyes&gt;Wharf Rat&gt;Terrapin&gt;Morning Dew .... are you kidding me? That shit is every Jerry fan's wet dream right there). 

  What do you think? Do you prefer Barton Hall? What's your favorite Dew and what features about it make it as close to perfect as possible in your mind?

  Bonus question:  Do you think 5/22&gt;5/8? Cuz I think I do (I highly recommend checking out the whole show, as DP3 had to omit 8 songs to fit it on a 2 CDs, a total shame)

What is your favorite Dead year (currently) and why?,"See title

Currently I've been on a '72 kick and I'm of the opinion that this is THE peak Dead year. As much as I love '73, '74, '77, and '87-'90 I think '72 is undoubtedly home to their best jams. Every single show I've heard is dripping with lysergic power, the entire band is in straight shaman mode and the sound is still clean and pure. I feel as though every year after this is somewhat more ""corrupted"" (not the best word to describe it) by the influence of hard drugs and alcohol. In '72 the raw spiritual power reigns supreme though, there was obviously still some other things involved but the flow of the music has yet to be redirected (?) by addiction.

Im not sure if I'm explaining this well but I'm doing my best lol. Basically I feel as though the band is more focused than any other year, they're still scouting uncharted territory and taking things as deep as possible, perhaps too deep at times. I feel like '72 crossed a lot of lines that shouldnt be crossed and as a result they had to dial back the psychedelia substantially afterward, gradually becoming more of a ""good times"" band as opposed to a ""horrifyingly intense spiritual awakening"" type band. Although its always been a little bit of both, and I sometimes prefer their later sounds as well. I just believe that in '72 they were still searching in every show and kind of found what they were looking for to a certain extent.

Does that make sense? What do you guys think? List your favorite(s) and explain",gratefuldead,1510167395,TheOriginalTomatoSal,49,19,True,2017-11-08

Dead and Co show dilemma,"My friend and I bought tickets for the show Sunday at Madison Square Garden and it was $180 each for the seats just below the nosebleeds. Sometime after, my friend’s dad got him two more free tickets after we already bought them so he invited two more of our friends to go. Turns out these free tickets are GA and neither me or my friend has ever been even close to that at a Dead show. I guess my question is whether it’s a dick move to use the GA tickets for me and my friend who paid money and have our other friends sit in the seats we bought, rather than all enjoy the concert together in the seats we bought (we’d trade the two GA tickets with two people sitting in that section).",gratefuldead,1510177532,ODogZahradsauce,10,5,True,2017-11-08

Best speaker/headphone brands for Grateful Dead?,"Beginner audiophile here and I figure there must be more around here. To improve my Grateful Dead listening experience, I just spent good amount of money on my first stereo, powering some Elac B6 Debut speakers. They sounded great during a quick demo when I bought them used on CL, but once I got home I realized the sound signature did not suite the Grateful Dead. Highs were too recessed and too much bass, not enough detail. Online reviews seem to echo my thoughts as well...


Looking into headphones now while I research if I can EQ the speakers to suite me better. Any good recommendations under $400? I'd ask the headphones subreddit, but I figure you guys know better than anyone else the exact sound I'm looking for: wide soundstage and up front mids and highs to really bring out Jerry without being too fatiguing.

I know headphone brands are often generalized, like the ""ugh the Sennheiser Veil"" or ""...sounds like Grados""...any good general recommendations on headphones (maybe speakers too) that really suit the Dead? Thanks.

[It's really Bob!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atzDrdMZqy8&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Bralove is an auxiliary keyboard–synthesizer player who worked as a sound technician with Grateful Dead from 1986 to 1995. He was influential on their integration of MIDItechnology, first working with drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, keyboardist Brent Mydland, and later guitarist Bob Weir and synthesizer/piano player Vince Welnick. He also co-wrote and contributed to such songs as *Picasso Moon, Way to Go Home, Easy Answers.*

Perhaps his biggest project with the Grateful Dead was assembling segments of jams on the 1991 Infrared Roses compilation album. *Parallelogram* and *Little Nemo in Nightland* are two of his most notable compositions from this release.

In addition to his songwriting, producing, and MIDI programming activities for the Grateful Dead, Bralove is known for his performing and designing with the Grateful Dead and the avant-garde *Drums and Space* segments of their live shows with the Rhythm Devils.

Bralove was also a member and producer of the Psychedelic Keyboard Trio, along with former Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten and Vince Welnick, former keyboardist for the Grateful Dead and the Tubes.

My thoughts on 11/9/17,"The tour is of to a great start I was really excited I had just gotten home from a shitty day at work and it feels great to just kick back and watch the livestream.

The atmosphere of the concert didn't feel right I know it's a great cause it just feels weird to have the dead and Metallica back to back like I could even tell on the cameras that it just didn't feel right.

That being said the show felt more commercial like they played the crowd pleasers not a bad thing just something I noticed 

I thought deal was fantastic one of their best I love the long deals and how the song has become somewhat of a staple of their shows again do in fact let that deal go down.... I never get tired of hearing it

Not fade away was also really tight and was just about perfect I was digging Mayers tone on it

Scarlet/fire- was pretty good I don't know how I feel yet about oteil singing more songs yet I find it awesome that you never know who's going to exactly sing what however to be honest I don't like John's falsetto and I really wish they'd hire another backup singer I know you guys mostly don't like Donna but I feel like she adds something that isn't there yet in Dead &amp; co and I'm not saying necessarily get her but get someone to fill the role 

Touch of grey- not much to say about it it was ok

And lastly playing in the band I felt like it was really cluttered and should of been more of a drawn out jam they did however have time constraints and most likely were just trying to get through the set list 

I really liked the experimentation this show and I hope it continues again with different singers along with as a guitar guy I'd love to see a diversity of guitars John loves his PRS and bobby loves his start but it would be cool to hear different sounds I also noticed the drummers were amped up more experimenting this show which was really awesome as a young 17 yr old deadhead dead &amp; co is the closest I have to seeing the real thing and I've seen them twice and will always cherish it I love the Dead with all my heart and really hope they tour forever 💀⚡️🍁

Now for the real question were the guys on something? 😏

But no really what did you guys think let me know! ",gratefuldead,1510293397,fufe25,5,4,True,2017-11-10

I've heard the title track on the album maybe a few times, but the encore where they play it but for over 20 minutes straight up blew me away yesterday when I heard it for the first time. The way some of the stuff plays on that recording it almost sounds like they're translating studio effects onto the stage WHILE they were playing.

Asked Oteil about the Stay Tease during the O&amp;F Baltimore VIP meet and greet,"So I've loved this jammy little snack since I first heard it and even got a live version at Burrgettstown I think. So I had to get a little background if I could.   We get the venue and pick up a CD to get signed for a friend that couldn't make it to the show.  

When its our turn in line for a pic and chat I hand him the CD and tell him I'm dying to know how it came about.  Was it organic coming out of a jam or did they plan it? He seemed confused by my calling it the 'stay tease' maybe he'd never heard that phrase or maybe it was the herbal supplements. I don't know. 

So I sang  'oh won't you try-y-y just a little bit harder' so now he gets it and says 'Oh,  I don't know.  Pretty sure Mayer did it in rehearsals and then we worked on it for a little while. We have to work out all that kind of stuff.'  I'm like a school girl all giddy and shit.  Get the CD back shake his hand and get our picture taken.    

Just figured I'd share. 

Oh..side note: the girl I'm with asks afterwards 'Did you see his face when he said his name?' I clarified 'Mayer?' She says 'Yeah, he lit up. He must really like him'",gratefuldead,1510368173,thatdumb8oy,5,12,True,2017-11-10

Murder and Dying in Dead lyrics (discussion),"There's a lot of death in dead tunes.   Anyone know why, or have info of them talking about this? I find it fascinating...not sure why.    I know they are the Grateful DEAD  but I associate their music with positive mind set, good times and good vibes...death kinda flies in the face of this.  I vaguely recall once some one saying ""death is the ultimate trip"" but can't remember who or in what context, they probably were not even talking about their music.  Thought that might have something to do with it. 

What's odd is many times Bobby or Jerry are doing the killing or dying, or doing it through a first person character in the song  (Black Peter, Wharf Rat).   Sorry to be morbid.  I've been listening  to them for 20 years and I just realized this.  Feel free to discuss or add to the list.

Who is meeting up at American Beauty before the show :)?,"Would love to meet up with someone! I'm going with my mom, who is not familiar with the music at all. She's not really pro-drugs tho.

I’m looking to acquire the June 30, 2017 Wrigley poster. If anyone has one they’d like to move I would be happy to trade or purchase it. Please let me know. Was at the show but missed out on the poster.

It’s the one with the three bears in the batters box.

Thanks ",gratefuldead,1510515505,Terlingua_Tonto,0,3,True,2017-11-12

""Fresh off their highly acclaimed summer tour, DEAD &amp; COMPANY has added a fall leg to its 2017 tour beginning with two shows at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, November 12 and Tuesday, November 14."" - From [MSG's Site] (https://www.msg.com/calendar/madison-square-garden-november-2017-dead-company)

Well, folks. Here we are again: the first night of what is certain to be another historical tour. These D&amp;C tours (and the Setlist Threads) have drawn me closer to the bigger Dead Family and for that I am truly Grateful. Thanks to all you who make this subreddit what it is (a bright light in the darkness that reddit can be).  
As always, if you find stream links (unofficial audience recordings) feel free to post them here and I will add them to the growing list. If you find links to restreams of the official broadcast I would ask if you would just PM it to those who want it (just to keep everything kosher, so to speak). If you are attending the show tonight and would like to be added to the list, just say so!

##Remember: be kind, stay GRATEFUL, and have a great show!

A Stream-Sharing Idea,"This might be a long shot but worth it if anyone will come through. On the website rabb.it users make public chat rooms in which every member of the room is watching something online picked by the room’s host, who has the “remote”. Plus everyone in the room gets to talk to each other during the stream. It’s totally free and people commonly make public rooms for others to join and watch a movie on Netflix at no expense, so I don’t think there’d be an issue with someone using their nugs subscription on there if they would. That way no one has to share links or anything. Just a thought. I personally couldn’t afford to couch tour but I thought this might be a good, legal means of sharing streams.

Help on the Way - Your Weekly Listening Thread - 2/14/69 - First show in Philly! - Dark Star - Jammy set,"Welcome back to another installment of your weekly listening thread, Help on the Way *!!*

This is a cool show for me personally -- first time the dead came to my hometown!

https://archive.org/details/gd69-02-14.sbd.cotsman.6286.sbeok.shnf

Here's the jammy set:

One - 1:04:31	

Good Morning Little Schoolgirl [9:30];[1:46] ;
Dark Star [#18:32] &gt;
Saint Stephen [6:06] &gt;
The Eleven [15:47] &gt;
Turn On Your Love Light [12:21];[0:27] %

Two - 48:48	

Morning Dew [10:18];[0:23] ;
Cryptical Envelopment [2:03] &gt;
Drums [0:13] &gt;
The Other One [9:12] &gt;
Cryptical Envelopment [14:03] &gt;
Death Don't Have No Mercy [12:22]

Comments	Total time [1:53:19 +]. Probably only the first few bars of Dark Star are clipped on the circulating tape. 

The Eleven analyzes St. Stephen &gt; 1st vocals 1:08 &gt; transition Jam 2:39 &gt; Eleven Jam 4:57 &gt; Eleven vocals 0:40 &gt; Eleven Jam 5:10 &gt; Eleven 2nd theme Jam 1:04 &gt; Turn On Your Love Light.

It seems unlikely that the show ended with Death Don't. DeadBase IX's list concludes with Alligator &gt; Caution, and this may be correct, but the tape of Alligator &gt; Caution &gt; And We Bid You Good Night in circulation mislabeled ""2/14/69"" actually belongs to Fillmore West 8/22/68.

Remember, this whole project is randomized. A run down about what this is all about can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/2fqahw/z/cke00lq

Thoughts on 11/12/17 - MSG (*Tour Opener),"Was sitting in Section 101, midway up and here are some quick thoughts, comments, reactions to last nights opening effort:


I thought that the mix was generally better than most of last summer’s shows (the soundboard is now confirming it).  I think the board turned the drums down a little bit and evened them out in the mix from previous tours.  Some of Mickey’s slaps and fills are blended a little better.  Jeff could use turning up (as always) but I thought John/Oteil/Bobby were nicely represented.  I think the one exception was a bit of squeaking from Bobby on his part in China Cat… could have used an adjustment on that one.


Notable Bust-Out:  Greatest Story Ever Told.  Niceeeeee.  Bob sounded fantastic on this.


I think the run from Set Break through Drums was the highlight of the night:  China&gt;Rider, Ship of Fools, Terrapin.  Ship of Fools was a particular treat with some nice layering in of Oteil on the vocals.  This song for me was the evening’s highlight!  Some weird flow to the Post-Space songs, a killer SOTM but just a little choppy and an odd placement of TOO as an isolated song (rather than a “jam-vehicle”).  Seems like SOTM and TOO flipped positions at Set Break..


Generally, I thought that the show had a lot of great individual songs/efforts but fell a little short as a whole show.  Some tough miscues (notables including the start to Cumberland, transition from Space to SOTM, some vocal jams at the end of Shakedown and They Love Each Other) perhaps from a lack of practice or difficulty hearing.  Hard to tell.  Gotta give the boys a pass though as this was their first outing of the tour!  I think they need a Monday Morning QB mindset and get back to it on Tuesday.  Not the best I’ve seen/heard from them.


Looking forward to Tuesday!!

DEAD AND COMPANY 11-14-17 GAME CONTINUES,"Hello folks. I'm here till somebody wins. A rules refresher: guess the opener, closer and ENCORE(S) for tonight's show.

Get all three correctly and I will gift reddit gold.

CLARIFICATIONS: 

(Feel free to ignore the rest of this post)

If there is a double encore, you will need BOTH songs. ALSO, if the songs are a medley, you must put them together (just for the encore.)

 As an example, if the play an acoustic ripple, change guitars and do OMSN, the encore answer must say Ripple, OMSN. If the songs segue into each other, you must display so. EX: Lovelight &gt; Liberty. ONLY FOR THE ENCORE, IF THE SECOND SET ENDS WITH CHINA &gt; RIDER, YOU ONLY NEED TO GUESS ""RIDER""


BUT COME ON, YOU'RE MAKING IT TOO HARD!!!


Well, this is NOT supposed to be easy. It's supposed to reward someone for doing something very hard to do. This is no gimme.


Last show at MSG, out of 60 submissions, no one even got 3 songs that were played, regardless of order. In other words all of the 60 submissions had a song that was not even played.

All answers must be submitted before tuning. Duplicate answers will go to the person who first posted.

Editing answers during the show will disqualify you.


Also, I am doing this for the fun and NOT for likes and karma. Dont bother upvoting these threads. Just read, guess and have fun. Share this thread with friends, get as many guesses as possible in. I dont want to do this all tour, ill leave that to /r gratefuldead

My guesses: 

Opener: Jam &gt; Truckin

Closer: Sugar Magnolia

Encore: Brokedown

(Yes, I am playing too. So please don't copy my answers)

Good luck and lets hope someone gets it tonight.



RESULTS:

OPENER: ""Jam &gt; Hell in a Bucket"" or Hell in a Bucket

CLOSER: NOT FADE AWAY

ENCORE: US BLUES

No one won this show. See you guys on Thursday in Philly.

Miracle Available for Philly 11/16,"So I bought a ticket to this show the day they were released. I've seen every Dead and Co show in Philly/Camden so far. 

When I bought the ticket, my wife was pregnant and due in November 19th. I rolled the dice and figured maybe I'd be able to make it.

Wife still hasn't had the baby, but unfortunately my dad went into the ICU this Sunday. He has MS, and is on life support now. I don't want to leave him, or my wife waiting to have our baby,  so the concert is definitely not happening. 

I'd like to give this ticket to somebody who hasn't been able to see these guys yet. It's GA, which is where I was the first time I got to see them. If it's your first ever Dead show that's even better. Just trying to give the ticket to whoever would appreciate it the most.

All I ask is that you get there early, get up front and have a fucking blast. I have the digital ticket as an email so I'll forward sometime tomorrow. 

Good vibes to everybody out there.

Any songs you like a D&amp;Co version MORE than a classic GD version?,"Sooo I was already sort of having the feeling lately that I enjoy the way they do The Other One and Estimated. I like the way johnny checkers sort of shreds all over the other one, and I like the synth that Jeff plays.. they sort of take it to the next level. With estimated, I know Jerry has crushed Estimated many times before, but I really do like johnnys playing on it. I think bobbys voice sounds better now on some songs than it used to. He also uses those delay effects which are fuckin awesome, he changes the spacing of the vocal phrasing which really grew on me, and I just love the sound and tightness of the band on these songs in general. The versions I was listening to were from 6/9/17, although they did just play both songs at MSG (separate nights I believe) but I haven't listened to those again, although the Estimated was def a good one. 

After going to both concerts I started thinking a little more.... I REALLY really liked the 11/14 versions of Tennessee Jed and St Stephen. Like I'm talking love here ladies and gentlemen. I LOVED those versions. So what do we say? Are there any D&amp;Co versions that MAY be (just may be) superior?...or is that just sacrilege?",gratefuldead,1510797348,jeddzus,70,8,True,2017-11-15

Nugs Mobile App Questions,"Hi folks, happy fall tour, and boy is it off to a fantastic start!  

So I subscribed to the nugs.net app again on iPhone and I just seem to find the experience...  less than satisfying.  Even with Gapless Playback selected, songs downloaded for offline listening or songs sequentially queued still have a VERY noticeable gap between songs which really ruins moments where they flow well (china/rider, etc etc...).  Anyone else experiencing this?

My other question is for those who have subscribed to the hi-fi CD quality package.  Was it worth it?  When I listen to the nugs streams on youtube, the sound quality is great.  The mixing seems really well done and I can accurately hear each member's contribution.  The standard playback package (which I have) through nugs just seems so bad compared to what I'm hearing via the streams.  The mixing seems a bit off, and the sound stage feels distant, like I'm not actually sitting there experiencing the music live.  I feel like I have to turn my speakers up considerably to get the same experience I get listening to OLD dead shows through spotify.   Is this corrected with the CD quality package?

Dead and Company Phully 11-16-17 GAME CONTINUES,"We are back to play the game for tonight in Philly. A rules refresher: please guess the Opener, Closer and ENCORE(S) for tonight's how.

Remember a few things: You will need both songs if there is a double encore, and you must indicate if they segued into each other or did not. You do not have to do this for the opener and closer.

Also, any submissions after tuning will not be valid, nor will answers that have been edited during the show.

Reddit gold is the prize for getting all 3.

My guesses tonight:

Opener: Dancing in the Streets

Closer: Morning Dew

Encore: Liberty, Johnny B Goode.

GOOD LUCK, AND SOMEONE WIN ALREADY!

Also, I am thinking of changing the formula if no one wins today. My proposed idea is to allow everyone to not only pick the opener/closer/encores but also pick the 1st set closer,2nd set opener as well as a bonus song, and If you can get three correctly PLUS THE BONUS, you win. Thoughts? The bonus is a song that is played, but set placement does not matter whatsoever.


RESULTS

OPENER: DANCING IN THE STREETS 

CLOSER: Goin' Down the Road Feelin Bad

ENCORE: Black Muddy River

No one got it. Sticking with old formula for now in Boston. Hope you guys keep playing, if it gets dead ill just stop lol.

Comes a Time when you really geek out,"Good Day Fellow Heads,

I wanted to share with you all a project I have been working on. First a quick back-story. I bought the Get Shown the Light box set earlier this year. One gem for me was the Buffalo show from 5/9/77. I had never really listened to it before. It is really great, just as good if not better than Cornell in my opinion. Anyway, while listening to this show, one thing that stood out to me was the ""Comes A Time"". It was hypnotizing and so full of emotion. Then a few months later, Dead and Co bust out ""Comes A Time"", with Otiel slaying it btw, and it triggered my fascination with the tune again. 

Fast forward a couple months, this song is still bouncing around in my subconscious, I had a thought that this was one of Jerry's finest tunes. I wondered if there were any versions better than the one Buffalo from '77. That curiosity led me to wonder how many times C-A-T was played. I found that number online; there were 65 of them performed by the Dead. Then a few days later I had another thought... I could listen to them all, take notes along the way, and find the ultimate version. 

So that's what I did. Over the course of a month I listened to every version of Comes A Time. It was a fascinating journey. It started in Minneapolis in '71 and traveled through space and time to Landover in '94. I experienced an uncommon journey. After finishing all the versions, looking over my notes, and chatting with a friend about it, I decided to write a blog about the project. It is at https://gotanemptycup.wordpress.com/ . Over the next few months I'm going to share some of my thoughts, observations and notes through a series of blog posts. 

So if you dig the project and would like to read about some of the things I discovered, please check the blog. I'm going to attempt to add a new post every week.

I went from being the worst I've ever felt in a few years, to being happy and content based solely off the music.

"A short history of CSNY, the Grateful Dead, and the music they created together - Complete with links to interviews, studio collaborations, and live recordings","**The History**

In the summer of 1969, Stephen Stills lived for the most part on Mickey Hart’s ranch; both had a love for horses and Stills acquired a thoroughbred racehorse for Hart. Of course, this was the year that Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash had begun to materialize and so David Crosby naturally showed up at the ranch regularly. Musical bonds formed quickly, and on December 10 at the Thelma Theatre, Stills joined the band in the second set, debuting the Louisianan country blues song, ""Black Queen,"" and playing on multiple others.

By the end of that year, [Stills told Crosby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyrvIafPbBY) that he had promised the Grateful Dead that when he finished recording *Déjà Vu* with Crosby, Graham Nash, and the recently acquired Neil Young, he would help them make a record since, as Crosby agreed, “they aren’t very good at it."" Ultimately, Jerry Garcia also helped CSNY on *Déjà Vu*, as Graham Nash recalled in his memoir, *Wild Tales*:

&gt;“The Dead and the Airplane were also at Heider’s, but in adjacent studios, working on new stuff. I didn’t know Jerry Garcia too well, although I knew he was a fine musician, so Crosby suggested I approach him about playing on “Teach Your Children”…I’d heard Jerry had just started playing pedal-steel guitar and asked if he would add a pedal track to my song. After the first take I said, ‘Thanks Jerry, you’re done.’

&gt;‘No, no,’ he protested, ‘I fucked up that part when we go right into the chorus. Can I do another?’

&gt;‘Absolutely, do it,’ I told him, ‘but I’m never going to use it. The first one was exactly what I wanted.’

&gt;And of course, his pedal steel was one of the defining elements in that recording.”

""Teach Your Children"" and the time spent at Wally Heider’s recording studio helped kick off a period of close musical and personal relationships between various members of the two bands. Jerry Garcia would go on to play pedal-steel on 5 more songs across 4 albums by Crosby, Stills, and Nash in their solo and duo ventures. 

As you all know, in 1970 the Grateful Dead released *Workingman’s Dead* and *American Beauty*. The harmonies – thanks in part to the help of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash – are some of the most defining aspects of both albums. [When asked about what influenced such a radical change from the sound of the “*Anthem* era,”](https://youtu.be/GrRpW1EOqhs?t=6) Bob Weir simply relied “Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.” Later in the same interview, Weir was asked how they achieved the lush harmonies on their Americana albums and he expanded on his earlier remark: “Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash had us way beat at that…we called it stacking back then…you record a chorus – the Eagles were famous for it –…I don’t know how many tracks of ‘ooos’ back there but, y’know, they turned themselves into a choir.” “We probably did it once and then two more times,” Phil Lesh added, “…everybody doubles and they sing their part two or three times,” giving some songs with three-part harmonies nine vocal tracks.

Following CSNY’s fantastic 1970 Summer Tour (go check out the June Fillmore shows or *4 Way Street*), the band broke up in a firestorm. After Stills and Young had been chasing Rita Coolidge for some time, Nash swept in. Stills fury was captured in Crosby’s ""Cowboy Movie,"" in which four men return from a train robbery to enjoy the spoils only to find an “Indian girl standing all alone.” Stills is personified in the story as Eli, the outlaws’ “fastest gunner” who is “kind of mean and young from the South,” Young as the Duke, and Nash as Billy:

&gt;“Now Eli and the Duke they got down to it,

&gt;They each wanted the Indian girl for their own,

&gt;But when they finally got around to asking her,

&gt;You know she said she'd come to take young Billy home.

&gt;Eli said he'd kill young Billy,

&gt;He'd kill the Duke, and probably me too, yeah”

After Stills’ outburst, the band dissolved for a time. Stills’ remained close with Hart and Garcia, who played pedal-steel on Stills’ ""Jesus Gave Love Away for Free"" and ""Change Partners."" In the period following the band’s breakup, the four members focused their time on what would become four acclaimed solo albums, each recorded in the spirit of Laurel Canyon at the time. 

The folk-based L.A music scene was a tight night musical community. From 1968 to 1975, musicians from L.A would often have many of their friends and peers play (many times on instruments they were not known for) on their albums instead of studio musicians. Joni Mitchell’s album *Blue* featured Stephen Stills on bass; James Taylor both played banjo and sung harmony with Linda Ronstadt on Neil Young’s song ""Old Man;"" and on Crosby’s ""Music Is Love,"" Graham Nash played guitar and sang while Young sang and played guitar, bass, vibraphone, and congas. Many great collaborations sprang out of this community and it eventually leaked into neighbouring music scenes.

Crosby’s experimental side mixed well with the Bay Area scene’s acid-infused psychedelic rock. in the days of The Byrds he had hung out with the Jefferson Airplane quite regularly but the real musical melting pot began in 1970 when Paul Kanter of the Airplane set out to record *Blows Against the Empire*. He not only recruited members from the Dead, but Crosby &amp; Nash as well, as they were all neighbours at Wally Heider’s studio. Out of this, the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra was born – a term coined by Paul Kanter to describe this new merger of the LA and San Francisco Bay Area music scenes that had its roots at Heider’s studio. 

Shortly thereafter, Crosby and Nash delivered *If Only I Could Remember My Name* and *Songs for Beginners*, respectively. Both albums were PERRO projects to different degrees. Nash’s debut solo album was rooted more in his pop infused folk and featured Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann, and Jerry Garcia among a large list of well-known musicians of the time. The contributions on Nash’s albums all bear the mark of the musicians who played on it, but Crosby’s album was created, as he said, “on the edge.”
*If Only I Could Remember My Name* heavily featured members the members of PERRO with other additions as well. Only Pigpen and Bob Weir did not appear on Crosby’s record. Weir's absence could perhaps be explained by [Crosby himself:](http://www.dead.net/features/grateful-dead-hour-no-41)

&gt;“I was living in Mill Valley, and Bobby [Weir] lived in Mill Valley. They were trying to rehearse, and I would go over and drag along my Stratocaster and cause trouble. I would go in and they would be trying to record, even, and I would cause trouble. I would go in and say, ‘ah, you guys don't have a real rhythm guitar player.’ [laughs] Which endeared me to Bob forever, I'm sure.”

Nonetheless, every Grateful Dead member, save for Weir and Pigpen, played on Crosby’s record a great deal and contributed heavily to the overall sound. I don’t need to preach about how good Crosby and Nash's first solo albums are, just go listen to them.

Following the PERRO era, the relationships between Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and the Grateful Dead remained close. Phil, Jerry, and Bill all played on *Graham Nash David Crosby* in 1974 (finally finishing one of the PERRO era's greatest songs), Crosby and Stills appeared on stage with the Dead many times, and Phil teamed up with Crosby &amp; Nash in the 90s and 2000s for live collaborations. The respect CSNY and the Grateful Dead had for eachother is visible in how many times their musical paths crossed since 1969, but [David Crosby's remarks in 1970 sums it up well:](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-rolling-stone-interview-david-crosby-19700723)

&gt;""...I think Jerry Garcia probably needs me like he needs a third eye. Excuse me, a fourth. He has a third. But I would be just so knocked out to play, or sing, or do any kind of music with that dude. I mean, you know I would! Hey, and he's not the only one. What about Lesh, man? Have you really considered what kind of a musician Phil Lesh is? I would like to make a record sometime with him playing classical music on an electric bass. He is certainly one of the most virtuoso string instrument players on the planet.

&gt;Somebody somewhere, sooner or later, has got to realize that the Grateful Dead is one of the best bands in the world. And I hope that it's more than just the people who occasionally see them do a really stupendous set. But they're — man, on a good night the Dead is as good as it gets. Period. I mean they can take people and make 'em just absolutely fucking boogie till dawn. And there's very little of that around""

Story behind the Europe '72 album cover?,"So I recently acquired a vinyl copy of Europe '72 and the album cover got me thinking. The squares on the Ice Cream Kid's shirt are exactly 1/4"" x 1/4"". Which happens to be the size of a standard tab of acid.

On the other side, the same pattern is on the sock, which is also visible through the hole in the shoe.

Is this a reference to the band smuggling LSD into Europe for that tour in someone's sock? Or hidden in the false bottom of a shoe?

I'm really digging late-period Minglewood Blues right now. Shoot me your best Minglewoods 88-95,"This was the first dead song I ever heard on purpose, and it's stuck with me forever. While late 70s minglewoods certainly blaze, I love the group dynamics of the late period Minglewoods and I love tracking who is leading at what period. In my humble opinion, Minglewoods are the best set 1 warmup songs because everyone gets a chance to go wild for a bit. 

Seriously. Minglewoods. Mingle them into my wood. I don't know what that means. 

6-26-94 is my jam right now but it takes a bit to get going and Jerry's tone is kind of off, in my opinion. I'm hoping something for the jammy bite this one has, but a bit cleaner and less overdrive on Jerry. 

Alpine 89 has a great Minglewood and Brent goes wild on this one, but it lacks something.

Wharf Rat vs. Stella Blue vs. Black Peter....The Jerry Ballad Thread,"For me, this is the absolute best part of any Grateful Dead concert.

So what is your choice for agonizingly-slow, remarkably-written and played Jerry tear jerker that normally occurs in the ""ballad spot"", right before the 745th reendition of Around and Around where Weir wakes up everybody with a full on screaming rock parade in short shorts?

Most popular choices include:

Wharf Rat

Stella Blue

Black Peter

Morning Dew

Questions about July 1978,"I always thought July 78 were fantastic shows, but something was different. I noticed that the dead seem to be not using any distortion or wah effects. Fire on the mountain is mostly slide and clean guitar with no wah and jerry just seemed to possibly use an octave pedal for about a minute in the song. The other one uses a lot of crescendos with Keith to build the song with out distortion. Estimated profit is the only one that seems to have a wah used but there sound is super clean with Bob occasionally using some Chorus.

Show Dates: 7/1/78 7/3/78 7/5/78 7/7/78 7/8/78

Music critic Pierro Scaruffi on the Dead,"&gt; The Grateful Dead, considered by many as ""the"" greatest rock band of all times, were a monument of San Francisco's hippy civilization, and, in general, a monument of the psychedelic civilization of the 1960s. Their greatest invention was the lengthy, free-form, group jam, the rock equivalent of jazz improvisation. Unlike jazz, in which the jam channelled the angst of the Afro-american people, Grateful Dead's jam was the soundtrack for LSD ""trips"". But soon it came to represent an entire ideology of evasion from the Establishment, of artistic freedom, of alternative lifestyle. Contrary to their image of junkies and misfits, the Grateful Dead were one of the most erudite groups of all times, aware of the atonal compositions of the European avantgarde as well of the modal improvisation of free-jazz as well as the rhythms of other cultures. They managed to transform guitar feedback and odd meters into the rock equivalent of chamber instruments. The infinite ascending and descending scales of Jerry Garcia are among the most titanic enterprises ever attempted by rock music. The Grateful Dead never sold many records. Their preferred format was the live concert, not the record. They literally redefined what ""popular music"" is: the live concert shunned the laws of capitalism, removing the business plan from entertainment. Their recorded masterpieces, Anthem For The Sun (1968), Aoxomoxoa (1969) and Live Dead (1970), are mere approximations of their art. At the same time, though, their free-form jams were born out of a philosophy that was still profoundly American. They were born at the border between the individualistic and libertarian culture of the Frontier and the communal and spiritual culture of the quakers. Despite being ostracized by the Establishment, the Grateful Dead expressed, better than any other musician of that age, the quintessence of the American nation, and perhaps that was precisely the reason that their music resonated so well with the soul of the American youth. It is not a coincidence that the Grateful Dead, along with the Byrds and Bob Dylan, led the movement towards country-rock, via Workingman's Dead (1970) and Jerry Garcia's solo album Garcia (1972). The band spent their adult years trying to transform the subcultural idiom of the hippies into a universal language that could reach out to every corner of the planet (not only the hippy communes). They succeeded with a form of intellectual muzak which interpreted the lysergic trip as a cathartic escape from daily reality and liberation from urban neuroses: Weather Report Suite (1975), Blues For Allah (1975), Terrapin Station (1977), Althea (1979). In practice, their art was a psychological research on the relationship between the altered states of the mind (psychedelic hallucinations) and the altered states of the psyche (industrial neuroses).

Criteria includes two parts : boring technical factors such as phrasing, power, range, control and versatility, and « band » factors such as the extent to which the member’s vocal contributions helped define the group as well as the ability to « blend » with the other voices of the band and the consistency of the said voice.


1) Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan: (1965-1972)

The single greatest singer the Dead ever had. It's really not even close. Pigpen's voice was strong and soulful, and his emotion was out of this world. You could really hear the despair in It Hurts Me Too, and the horniness in Good Lovin. Even when his health deriorated and he was a shell of his former self, his voice remained intact (can’t same the say about everybody). Most importantly, he was without doubt the only thing close to a frontman the band ever had. He had an undeniable charisma and command of the audience, especially during Lovelight. Long before the heroin years and the gate-crashing dolts, when people said they were going to see the Dead during the 60’s, they were actually going to see Pigpen. 

Best performance : Just listen to him singlehandedly destroy the PA during It’s a Man’s World at Winterland. https://archive.org/details/gd70-04-15.sbd.kaplan.14354.sbeok.shnf


2) Jerry Garcia : (1965-1995) 

The most emotional and « mature » voice of the band by far. His voice was definitely not strong, and his wasn’t really a technical singer (none of them were), but by God did he know how to convey emotions ! His broken, nasal voice was the perfect instrument for stories of despair and loss such as Wharf Rat and Black Peter. You could really believe that August West spend half of his life drunk on burgundy wine, or that Peter’s fever rolled up to a 105. He was maybe not in his element during the rockers, which demanded a stronger voice, as well as a frontman persona that the Fat Man never had, and this is why Weir had the job of ending second sets with full on rock screaming mania. 

Best performance: THIS Morning Dew https://archive.org/details/gd72-05-26.sbd.hollister.12758.sbeok.shnf/gd720526-d1t03.shn


3) Donna Jean Godcheaux : (1971-1979) 

Yeah, yeah I know…But listen, Donna is the only classically trained vocalist the band ever had, and she proved on many occasions that she was not only a good singer, but a wonderful one. Her weakest point is her inconsistency and her inability to hear herself, especially in her early ears, yet from 1975 to 1978 she was absolutely beautiful whenever she opened her mouth. Her vocal contributions in JGB as well are the stuff dreams are made of. Most importantly, she is the ONLY vocalist in this list whose technique evolved towards the better. She was at her worst in 1971/1972, and at her very best towards the end of her tenure, but sadly it was the exact oppoite for her husband, and it cost her her place in the group. 

Best performance: THIS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNjUyMCdEkg


4) Bob Weir : (1965-1995) 

His Bobness began as a third wheel to the bravado performances of Pigpen and young Garcia, and boy did he come a long way ! Since 1971 ; he became the Ying to Garcia’s yang, and almost all concerts from then and all the way to 1995 incorporated the « Bob-Jerry-Bob-Jerry.. » routine to their setlists, only sporadically interrupted by another vocalist’s (a keyboardist, Donna or Phil) number. He took on Pigpen’s role as frontman, and did the best he could. His voice was equally suited for coutry ballads and screaming rockers, and many of his contributions are staples of the group’s discography. What differenciates him from Garcia is that most of the time he looked like a rock artist and not a meditative bearded monk, and actually looked like he was having a great time, screaming left and right and prancing around in short shorts, you know, just your typical rock God attitude. 

Best performance: This 1982 LLR https://archive.org/details/gd82-10-10.sbd.sacks.338.sbefail.shnf


5) Brent Mydland : (1979-1990) 

Mydland judged as a single entity would probably top this list, his voice is strong, powerful and emotional, but as part of the Grateful Dead, he did have his detractors. He did an OK job with Donna’s harmonies, as well as with Keith’s parts, he even did amazing work with some of the covers, but his personal contributions just scream « 80’s » and not in a good way, and are some of the most synth-filled, Michael MacDonald greatest hits-wannabes the band ever produced and looked completely out of place in a Grateful Dead setting. Those songs were pure cheese, like 10.000 Tons of Cheese. 

Best performance: This nice Dear Mr. Fantasy https://archive.org/details/gd89-07-02.nak.8243.sbefail.shnf


6) Vince Welnick : (1991-1995)

Poor guy. Vince never had it easy. It’s not that there was anything wrong with his voice : he was great in harmonies (i’d say better than Brent), and his keyboard playing was adequate as well. Yet for some reason his voice never did it for Deadheads, and unlike Donna, he never worked or even seemed to care for that aspect, as things were falling apart left and right around him. He was the right pic kat at a very bad time. Plus, you know you’re in trouble when your best known song is Samba in the Rain. 

Best performance: This Way to Go Home https://archive.org/details/gd92-06-28.sbd.braverman.8601.sbeok.shnf


7) Phil Lesh : (1965-1995)

Aaaah Phil. I think it goes something like Jerry&gt;Bob&gt;Donna at her best&gt;Donna at her worst&gt;street cats making love&gt;street cats fighting&gt;nails on a chalkboard&gt;Phil. 

Best performance: The American Beauty version of Box of Rain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4SqDx1vi4c

These members were part of the group as well but never sang or sang very sporadically : Tom Constanten – Bill Kreutzmann – Mickey Hart – Keith Godcheaux.

Need a ride to Dead and Co tour?,"Hey now! So I'm hitting up a few shows this Fall. First off, I will be flying out for both nights in NYC solo, and if anyone is interested in meeting up and hanging out/talk about music sometime during those shows, that would be great. It will be my first time in NYC.


After that, I will be driving from Salt Lake City to Dallas on the 26th or 27th of November, something like that. Looking at making it a 2 day drive at the moment. Passing through New Mexico/West Texas way on the 40. At which point I fly out from Dallas to ATL for that show on the 29th, but will be back for the Dallas show on the 1st. After Dallas, I am driving to the Austin and NOLA shows. I am currently planing on driving back to SLC by driving through the 25 through CO and taking the 80 westbound through WY. However, while listening to 9/6/91 today, when I heard the small Dark Star Jam come out of Space... that was all the convincing I needed to look into closing out the tour at both Florida shows. I am not sure about those two yet, but definitely a possibility. I work in agriculture (sustainable+organic) industry in Montana, so the timeframe of early December is pretty flexible for me.


What's the point in telling all y'all this? Well, if I can help you out in any way along my journey, let me know. If it's a ride from show to show, or a place to stay, give me a holler. I have hotels booked for each night of the show, on traveling days will play it by ear and sleep wherever works. Not looking for money, but certainly won't deny a donation if you are in a financially comfortable enough position to offer one. Just trying to help out fellow heads and maybe make a friend or two. If any of this sounds like something you may want to tag along for, shoot me a PM or comment. If you just want to talk about Fall '91 Dead, please leave a comment. If I don't reply immediately, I apologize. I live in rural Montana, and don't have internet available to me depending on where I am.

JGB 1995 vs GD 1995,"I was just listening to some 95 JGB, and it's interesting that Jerry doesn't sound too bad in 95 compared to 95 dead.

It makes me wish more that they had taken a break in 94. Jerry wasn't tired, he was tired of the dead. I think they said as much in the amazon documentary, but you can really hear it in the JGB vs GD shows.",gratefuldead,1508292063,mannyv,10,6,True,2017-10-17

"My late uncle was Pigpen's best friend in high school and I've never been able to find out much about him. I'm not very familiar with the Deadhead community so if anybody could point me towards some information on him, I'd be very grateful.","His name was Crandal Mackey, IV and he was known as Randy. He was born in 1946 and graduated from Paly High in '64 or '65. After his relationship with the Hell's Angels went sour, he moved to the mountains of New Hampshire. Since he left Palo Alto before The Grateful Dead name stuck, I haven't been able to find any information by researching their history but he played guitar, piano and harp for The Warlocks. My mother was ten years younger so she didn't know his friends very well but Ron did occasionally babysit her since she was good friends with his brother Kevin. She knew him ten years or so but unfortunately, he died shortly after she moved to the town where my uncle and I were both born. I haven't had any luck in trying to contact living friends of his and my mother has been my only living relative for most of my life. I've also never been to The Bay so I've never had much of a chance of running into someone that was in the same circles. I'm sure she has stories but asking questions can be difficult. He died on his Harley in 1970 and twenty-seven years later, my mother named me after him. I realize that for most of us, 1970 was quite some time ago but if anybody here has any memories of him or knows of someone that might, I'll be waiting with open ears and wide eyes.",gratefuldead,1508549586,seventh-spade,21,14,True,2017-10-20

1974-10-17 Promised Land - the piano lid crash,"I was reading up on all of the sources available for the final Winterland 1974 shows, and every tape lists ""a burst of static"" in the middle of Promised Land that is ""present on both aud tapes and SBDs.""  There is an explanation for that static, and it's pretty cool.  It's not static:  Keith's piano lid was open and apparently fell mid-way through the song (according to Corry Arnold's review of the show in DeadBase 9).  If you listen closely to the aud tapes, you can hear the slam and the resulting crackle of the mics in the piano getting banged around (and pushing that through the Wall of Sound at full tilt, no less).  The board tapes only give you the physical noise of the mics banging around and their connections taking a beating, and there is no bleed of boom from the PA into the vocal mics, as they were set up in pairs, out of phase.  Friggin' genius engineering.

I always enjoy finding little easter eggs like this in Dead shows....the banter, the failures, the crowd hoots that make it in to the tapes.  It helps paint a clearer picture of the history.",gratefuldead,1508594067,defsentenz,6,15,True,2017-10-21

Bobby's Guitar Part in Truckin' Jam,"Hi fellow deadheads! So I've been teaching myself ""Truckin'"" but I can't quite figure out what Bobby's playing in the jam at the end. 

For reference, I've been listening to shows from the Europe 72 tour to learn the song. I also looked at JDark's tab. 

My ear isn't great yet, but it sounds like he is playing an E power chord bluesy-shuffle mostly, and I know Jerry is playing an E minor pentatonic scale with some bluesy notes thrown in, so it would make sense Bobby is playing an E mostly. I'm just confused because at the end of JDark's tab he says they shift to a dorian jam, but I don't hear it, unless of course they didn't do that on the Europe 72 tour. I'm not yet super knowledgeable in Bobby's style, I just know he loves chord inversions. Any help is much appreciated!",gratefuldead,1508723504,EyesOftheDeadhead,2,3,True,2017-10-22

Unbroken Chain - Played live 10 times, first played 21 years after its release on Mars Hotel. Did they write this song knowing they wouldn’t play it live? What made them decide to play it after 21 years?

Pride of Cucamonga - Never played live.

Loose Lucy - Took a 14 year break.

Here Comes Sunshine - Took an 18 year break.

Death Don’t Have No Mercy - Took a 19 (?) year break.

Advice and suggestions to an absolute newbie,"Hello everyone,

Recently, I played a random mix-tape CD in my car that I found at a garage sale, and was blown away by one of the songs. After some Shazam-ing, it turned out to be Terrapin Station from the album Terrapin Station. The guitar solo (https://youtu.be/e01zTf2tLV0?t=2m33s) is one of the most beautiful things I've heard in recent memory, and so, I want to listen to more stuff by the Grateful Dead. 

I listen to a lot of prog rock (Gabriel-era Genesis, Camel, King Crimson, Yes, etc), and this song had a very prog-like feel to it. Can you guys suggest an accessible starting point for me (it could be an entire album, but also singles) ?

I hope this post will be the start of a new musical journey for me. Thanks for readin' :)

"""Jack O'Hearts and His Six Horse Chariot"" a poem about experiencing Jerry as a 21st Century Kid","I was born in 1997, so Jerry and I never shared the planet at the same time, much less did I get to see him live. Despite that, I've been on the bus for years, hours after hours after hours of listening and jamming, numerous Dead and Co./Phil shows over the last few years, even doing some Dead tunes whenever I play shows (solo acoustic/singer-songwriter stuff), and unlike almost any single human I know, Jerry is alive and wide open in my soul and heart. That's the power of music and an incredible legacy of art and energy and passion, and it's all preserved for eons to come. In a way, I'm happy to be part of the first generation of latter-day Deadheads who prove just how incredible that musical body is, how long-reaching it is, and how well preserved it all is. I love how I can jump onto the computer or pop in a CD and it's an unspoken dialogue of  ""Hey Jerry! Great to hear you again. Where you tuning in from today? 73? 89? 69? Let's go, man!"" I'm sure for you guys who did get to see Jerry, it's equally as great to be able to jump back in time and remember.

Anyway, I wrote this poem as a very artsy-fartsy expression of the eternal timelessness of Jerry's music and spirit living on in the modern age. ""Jack O'Hearts and His Six Horse Chariot."" Hope you enjoy.

Peering into the window screen/
A man by the name of Jack O’Hearts/
Appears to dazzle a frozen slice of infinity/
with his six horse chariot 

The window I’m at is bolted down/
by the hammer of time unceasing/
and the glue of mortal encapsulation/
but it doesn’t matter now 

because I have a window screen/
and the curtains are pulled and lights on/
and even if they were closed and velvet black/
Jack O’Hearts has a little magic trick 

He rallies round his horses now/
and his friends who crowed in dark rooms/
while the chemicals and fantasies of dawn/
had grouped them in a mystic destiny 

And with one howl and one fair sweep/
the horses storm forth from their master/
like thunder clouds on an interlocking sky/
except the sky is the air I breathe 

and in that air the horses dart through/
the window and the boundaries of existence/
they snort and they neigh in their victory/
and encircle my heart with wandering wonder

Hours seem to roll like centuries/
they cake me in their kicked up dust/
sweat from my overjoyed dance rolls/ 
and tears from my pierced soul trickle

they clean the dust off with no spot missed/
and the window starts to close up shop/
but not before Jack O’Hearts looks at me/
with his now transcendent smile beaming 

and says hello to me, an onlooker from a day/
he will never step foot in with his shoes/
but freely trots clear through to my delight/
with his six horse chariot a-blazing 

Jack O’Hearts, O Jack O’Hearts/
may you meet me with your stallions/
when all form and time lay vanquished/ 
and the birds of light are free 

until then, 
I’ll see you tomorrow/
through the windowpane ",gratefuldead,1505107424,ourdailydead,1,6,True,2017-09-11

second, one of my other favorite dark stars is the 'rockin the rhein'  version, mainly because it desintegrates into feedback. i came to GD from a more indie background (Sonic Youth, MBV are favorites) and i need more of this.

"It's impossible to say that the Dead had a ""best show of all time"". There are several different eras of the band, and within them perhaps a best show. But it wouldn't be right to say there is one that rules them all.","I was listening to 8/27/72 last night, a show that many a Deadhead says is the ""best show of all time"". I myself prefer May 1977 as my favorite era, hard to nail down a specific show, though. 

My point is, there are just so many moving parts within the band over their 30 years that it's impossible to say there is one that is better than the rest. Take 8/27/72 for example. You have Keith just playing beautiful stuff and matching up with Jerry, Phil, and Bobby independently. (However, as a side note, I know that Jerry didn't like that Keith would just repeat JG's riffs - there is a lot of that evident here). You also have one drummer - Billy, just absolutely killing it and ostensibly loving being the sole drummer. Then, move to 1977 and you have a very inconsistent Keith, arguably less adventurous and ""with it"" than he was in his first few years with the band. It changes the dynamic considerably. 

It, of course, goes without saying that there are a group of Deadheads who liked the Dead the most with Pig and didn't like them afterwards. 

It's almost like you'd have to dissect the band by era in order to pick a favorite show. Picking ONE ""best"" out of 2,000+ is a fool's errand. But it shows the beauty of the amazing cross section we have as fans, and that there is something there for everyone. Maybe we should be talking about our subjective ""favorite"" show, not a ""best"" show. ",gratefuldead,1505225836,AreDreamsOurParallel,9,6,True,2017-09-12

"I finally figured out why I don't like DeadCo (being serious, give me a chance)","Granted, I've not seen the real deal (only born in '90), but I saw The Dead in '09, Furthur a couple times, Ratdog, Chicago FTW, and I've seen four DeadCo shows. Hopefully, that helps to set the tone.

On to why I think DeadCo is a ""bad"" incarnation.

&amp;nbsp;

**The screens.**

&amp;nbsp;

Every iteration of the Dead before DeadCo (omitting FTW) has lacked screens (i.e. they've just had lights at the show -- no actual LED screens shows moving images). 

DeadCo is great fun to listen to, but if you're couch touring or at a show, it's patently ""John and Friends"". The screens *never* cut away from John during anything other than Bob's vocals (and even then you are sometimes forced to watch John's ""O-face""). 

This has had an obvious effect on the music, as John thinks it's cool to be the ""star"", and therefore lead every jam. Go back and listen to the interplay between the bass, keys, and guitar during a Furthur show -- it's like night and day -- DeadCo is all guitar, all the time. 

I'm quite aware that DeadCo is a great scene, don't get me wrong, but musically it's simply lacking a lot of what made the dead ""The Dead"". ",gratefuldead,1505252435,EnterSadman,16,0,True,2017-09-12

Never worn 90's era t-shirt up for trade....,"Was cleaning house , and noticed that I still have a new Jerry t-shirt from the '90s.  It was gifted to me (from my ex), I believe not long after Jerry died.

I and am hoping someone else here will enjoy it.  The Size is Adult Large.  But it is a well-made shirt so it is not small for its size like many shirts seem to be these days.

This isnt an auction, and I am not giving to highest bidder.  I do ask please do not resell it.  Only for people who will give Jerry a good home.  All I ask for in return is for you to send me a pre-paid self-addressed mailer that it will fit in for me to send back to you, along with something to trade....whatever you think it is worth.  If you do not have a lot, then dont worry.  Just send SOMETHING. Doesn't matter how small, if it is handmade or what it is, as long as dead-related.

PSA - Inexpensive Boston Hotel Option,"Hey everyone!  Just wanted to let people know that I found an inexpensive hotel in Boston that seems convenient to the Garden.

The Holiday Inn Bunker Hill currently has rooms for $109 ($124 after taxes) and is 2 miles/ 2 T stops from the arena.  Indoor pool, rock climbing wall (?!?), seems cool.  The catch is that this rate is non-refundable, no cancellations, although it seems that you could transfer the room to someone else with 3 days notice.  You might also have to sign up for their rewards program to get this rate but that shouldn't cost anything.  I think you'll have a difficult time finding anywhere cheaper in, or near, Boston unless you stay with a friend.

7/17/76 just stole my face (and i liked it),"I posted about the Comes a Time from 7/17/76 a few months back (dumbstruck, slackjawed and doe-eyed) but now here i am tonight listening to the second set Comes a Time &gt; Drums &gt; TOO &gt; EotMFW and...people of the internet can i get an amen!? This is the music that makes me stand up (while alone in my listening room/shed late at night, by myself) and exclaim (aloud) to nobody in particular (other than my sleeping neighbors)  ""THIS FUCKING BAND!"" My dog doesn't even look my way any more when i start yelling at the wall.

This may be some of my favorite ensemble playing from the boys of all time--they are all listening to each other very carefully and the interplay is incredible. You can bounce a quarter off of this tape it is so tight; they are taut and also squirmy and fluid and bouncy--pretty drippy psychedelic as they just shift the jams between themes and modes like a gooey tub of green butter. The Comes a Time alone deserves its own essay. Lots of space in between instruments and notes--even when it is dense with complexity it is never overly busy and nobody is stepping on each others toes. Phil and Billy are locked in, JG is fully in the zone and is liquid (Owsley, of course) on the fretboard. Everyone is locked in and wide eyed and ON.

My brain feels a bit scrambled by the Other One jam. This is great late night or headphone music. And the EotW and sheesh--my egg is cooked. And then the jam out of EotMFW...ba ba booie

One heat up, one cool down...do yourself a favor and get yourself down to the Archive silver mine and listen to the matrix version of this loud and tell me that this doesn't make the hair on your arms stand straight up! I am ready to stand up and pump my fist during the Eyes &gt; GDTRFB jam &gt; (spoiler alert) PSYCH!  TOO. 

I way normal ppl feel when they watch football and their team runs 60 hards for a TD in the 4th Q of a playoff game...thats how i feel listening to this second set.

By the time GDTRFB pulls up at the station, its hard not to feel all wide-eyed and dazed-- a little torn and frayed ""i have seen some real heavy  shit"" (TOO) and ""what the hell WAS that"" and then i get this feeling with GDTRFB...oh yeah--your brain is returning to earth and everything is gonna be ok and you are oh thank god im NOT gonna stay like that permanently after all....and the sweet soul balm that is the AWBYG jam on the way out...

Ending the set with OMSN is almost aww-sucks this old thing?  coy, just one more saturday night folks, NBD nothing to see here move along, which couldn't be farther from the truth!

This is some of the best Grateful Dead music of their entire career--this is heady soul music of the first order--they slay this second set. This set versus your favorite second set, any time, any place, nerd...bring it on! ",gratefuldead,1505621608,cosmicmerkinmusic,13,19,True,2017-09-17

What is your honest opinion on Jerry's voice?,"I hear a lot of even die hard deadheads say things like, ""Yeah, if only Jerry's vocals were half as good as his playing!""

&amp;nbsp;

Am I a minority for thinking he had an absolutely beautiful voice?  Like, obviously it's not ""perfect,"" but in a way I find it ""perfecter than perfect.""  You know what I'm saying?  I can't think of an adjective more appropriate to the Grateful Dead than [""wabi-sabi""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmHLYhxYVjA), and I think a lot of Jerry's singing, especially in the later years, can be called that.  Think of the gritty, soulful, passionate, *edge-of-death* vocals of ""So Many Roads"" at their last show.  There is an undeniable, ironic beauty to it.

&amp;nbsp;

In his healthy years, I don't even think there was anything ironic about it.  If you disagree, just listen to the last couple minutes of ""To Lay Me Down"" on his self-titled album.  He absolutely kills those high notes.

&amp;nbsp;

To be honest I've always loved Jerry's voice in any capacity, I would almost dare say equally as much as his guitar playing.  What do you all think?",gratefuldead,1505705690,hankkush,41,23,True,2017-09-17

They Love Each Other! God damn what a show!

Recently got my best friend on the bus after taking him to his first D&amp;C show,"He always ""liked"" the Dead, i.e. appreciated their musical talent and some of their music. But after his first show, he said ""I *get* it now."" And I feel like that's how it happens to many Deadheads. It just takes something to stick and you finally *get* it. Something clicks inside of you.

Anyway, he said something about the show (Blossom, for those curious) that stuck with me:

**""It was like one giant picnic/party in the woods, and this band just decides to pick up their instruments and start playing this incredible music. It didn't feel like we came here to listen to music, it's like we came here to experience it all; then the music just happened and it all started making sense.""**

I'm not sure why, but it really resonated with me and encapsulates my emotions about the band, the culture, and the experience. This guy, completely ignorant to the history of this band, completely described how this all originally came to be; an organic and spontaneous birth of music at the Acid Test Parties.

He was tripping balls, so I'm sure that didn't hurt either, but I thought it was cool and I'm so excited to have him on the bus. :-)

""What have you done to me, they're all I listen to now!"" was my last text from him.",gratefuldead,1505729261,abxuwnnm111,2,25,True,2017-09-18

I want to hold a Grateful Dead acid test party at my college,"I go to a mid-sized midwest undergraduate college known for being a party school.  It's occurred to me recently that not a lot of these people know how to party other than getting hammered in sports jerseys, occasionally throwing coke in the mix if that's they're thing.  For the vast majority of these kids (that think they're very cool)...THAT is the pinnacle of the college experience.  At the risk of coming off super bitter, I find it pathetic.  Hardly any of my peers seem to know a damn thing about psychedelics (much less jam music) and it deeply disheartens me to think that so many will piddle their way through these years thinking partying/music never gets any more fun than booze and the Chainsmokers.

&amp;nbsp;

Including this year, I have a two years left at this school.  I have made it my goal...no, my *mission,* to hold a Grateful Dead themed acid test party before I graduate.  Start at 11 PM, get some crazy lights, and just groove all night.  Tie dye and 60's/Dead themed parties kinda became cool on college campuses like a year or two ago, but from my understanding it was pretty superficial and didn't get any deeper than that.

&amp;nbsp;

Side note, I'm an RA this year and don't have a house.  Working on changing that next year, but know plenty of buddies with houses.  My buddies here aren't heady like the ones I have back home.  What's a solid game plan, socially, for bringing this crazy idea of mine to fruition?  Scope out the heads, then proceed?  (There's like 7,000 undergrads here and I've yet to find any.)  Or more guerilla tactics...get good friends with someone very popular, convince them this is a good idea, then proceed?

&amp;nbsp;

OK, this is a pipe dream, and one that I am likely overthinking.  But it want it to come true.  Dancing on psychedelics at Dead &amp; Co shows are some of the more fond memories in my life, and (nothing against most of you who are older than me and my jam friends)...I think it is time that a new generation be taught firsthand how awesome that can be.  I want to do ""mission work,"" here!  I have a firm belief that just about everyone's a Deadhead whether or not they ever figure it out.

Reach out to me if you are interested, and stay heady!

Do i cancel a trip to NY and just go for Cali?

or do I save up and hopefully pay for both trips (mind you, that's also travelling near christmas to the complete opposite of where I'm at, so it'll be about 1200 for the Cali trip just to get there)

"Grew up ""listening"" to The Dead, now I want to get into them myself.","Hey! 

Just a little bit a preface - I am (or was) so much more interested in Phish than The Dead. I am also pretty young for both of those crowds, but its still my thing.

I grew up listening to Phish and The Dead, and I mean that was pretty much the only stuff my parents would play, but I never was able to get into The Dead, no matter how hard I tried. Now, I'm like, why did I not find this shit earlier?! 

So, how do I get into them? I have been listening to a ton of shit from 72, 77 (mostly Europe, and Cornell), 83 (New Years Run completely blew me away), but my parents mostly played 89-94 and some random JGB stuff. 

While typing this, I'm listening to the Egypt shows for the first time, and, wow. It is just so fucking good.

I need more, but where do I go from here? I fucking love Blues For Allah and anytime they play Estimated. Is that a newbie thing to say? lol

Built to Last,"I prefer the early 70s Dead so I haven't really listened to many of their later songs, but today I was listening to a show from '89 and they played the song Built to Last. As I was listening to the lyrics I couldn't help but think that the meaning of the song seemed to contradict so much of the Dead's philosophy. I recall in A Long Strange Trip Jerry talks about how he doesn't want to build anything that can't be teared down, that he wants the music to be constantly in motion and never stagnant. Is this song an ode to how times have changed and their philosophy has changed or is there something else that I'm missing here? ",gratefuldead,1505945322,confetti27,2,5,True,2017-09-20

I would argue that if the Dead had broken up immediately following 'Blues for Allah' and had never been a phenomenal live band, people would absolutely adore their studio albums. There are just too many classic songs.

My August 9th Jerry story,"I'm younger than my old boss by quite a few years but either way we got along great. 

Back during my college years I used to clean pools for a dude named Lee. At the time I was a little into the Dead, American Beauty and Europe 72 were my two go to albums, but Lee was a 'Dead Head' I found out he had actually followed them around in one of those early VW conversion tent vans for about 9 years. He was a great artist as well and used to fill out envelopes every year for tickets. I saw some of his dead collection and it was amazing. He is also convinced that he is the dude who screams during that live recording of St. Stephen. ""Woooooooooooooooo""

Every August 9th he would tell me about the story of how he found out Jerry had passed. He said he woke up to the best day ever, him being a huge surfer he would get up super early and hit the waves while his husky watched from underneath the truck in the shade. Just a perfect beach day. This day was perfect. This day the waves were epic, not too big not to small. This day he water was clean, no seaweed no oil, just pergect. Not person in the way, waves to yourself. Perfect. 

After an epic surf session, hosing off feeding pooch, getting into the truck, fires up the radio and what's on? A little grateful dead, sunshine day dream, perfect for a day like that day. And then another dead song, I think it was Bertha he said. What kind of popular radio station would be playing 'off' track dead tunes? and then another and then another...and then another. You get the picture...

I remember him telling me, man this day can't get any better. Queue the radio...

""Listeners and those of you have just joined us, I unfortunately have to inform you, frontman of the Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia, has passed away at the age of 53"".

The way he tells the story is that of not where he was that day or what he was doing but where he came from in life and all the things he's done. The ups the downs, the where he has been and gone, specifically how the band shaped him and all the memories and people he's met along that long strange trip. I've fallen out of touch with Lee but I'll never forget all his stories and places he been and how the Dead shape his life and how it shaped mine, introducing me to the 'old' bands and some of the newer ones around today.

The band still plays on, with or without Jerry. But that's how i think he would want it. And I enjoy it.",gratefuldead,1502314611,timothy53,0,36,True,2017-08-09

They Could Never Take Our Couch Tour - Full Improv Jams Streaming Live Weekly,"Hey guys, it would be wrong of me to come here and pretend that I'm some true ""lover"" of the Dead, for even though I do in fact love the Dead, I haven't yet earned that right. But I do think some of you guys might really enjoy what we've been cooking up, so I wanted to drop this off here for anyone who might be interested. I've copied this text in full from another post in a different beautiful community much like this one- hope to see you guys for tonight and many more.


tl;dr - Live Improvised jams streaming every Thursday at 8:30 pm Central, from a rotating cast of Chicago area musicians doing an hour of completely imaginary music for imaginative people. Also coming soon to a weekly podcast version. FB(http://facebook.com/SunDeceivers) YOUTUBE(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpZw8Xj5Yqg2X4s1_AirY7A)  EDIT: That includes tonight!

Hey you damn beautiful souls, it's been a while since I've checked in with you guys and now that the BD has finally sailed off into the dark caverns of our pasts and we've been upgrading our living room groove stations I figured now was the perfect time to share! Since I first posted to anyone who would listen and wanted to be a part of the experience, The Sun Deceivers have grown from an idea into a weekly live broadcast featuring a rotating selection of excellent musicians. Each week we get together and throw down a full hour (with a small break) of completely improvised Type-II jams. Each night is different - some are high energy and explosive, some are low key and floating. It just depends on who's playing and what they're feeling in that moment.

It's been a couple of months now, and we've started to have a nice catalogue of back episodes and each episode gets added to the archive after transmission so you can always check back in if you can't make it live.

Anyway, this has become a wall of text so I'll wrap it up. The Sun Deceivers are streaming fully improvised jams live weekly on YouTube. Come share a moment, come share our energy. Do stuff on all the socials. Our family is where I feel safe, so I came here first.

Lets make something cool, lets make a new community. Lets make stuff up.

P.S. - If You Live in Chicago and want to play, send me a PM for sure. Unless you're Fisher, in which case we already know you need to get in this room ASAP!

P.P.S. - Sure, you could go to a bar. But the beer in your house is cheaper.

I'm currently looking for either a) The Images on the Anniversary Tees

I've also found the 25th Anniversary one (1990) but again, the prices of these are either sky high or sold out (in the case of some like REX FOUNDATION  1988 T-shirt  or the REX FOUNDATION  1989 T-shirt, or Rainforest Action Benefit (1993) or the Lithuania basketball one...

Mystery album,"Whilst rearranging my lps last night, I came across an album I don't remember purchasing or owning. The cover is completely blank - a white cover, the only design a stain from a coffee cup. I figured it was one of the famous bootlegs of Dylan, like the one that included ""Talking John Birch Society Blues."" I own both of them (somewhere), and they are both blank white covers, though if I remember right, at least one of them has a title stamped on it. This album has no identifying marks. I put the first record on the turntable, and lo and behold! it's One From the Vault (the show, not the official release). In other words, Great American Music Hall, 1975-08-13. The cover was created by someone who took a Chocolate Armenteros album, ""Chocolate Sexteto,"" and turned it inside-out. It sounds fantastic! Btw, the lp labels are interesting images of a Native American (?) with a spear and a dragon, on one lp, and on the other a monster-looking dude labeled ""Verzyl.""

* 1 Grateful Dead Song
* 2 Bob Weir Solo Song
* 3 Robert Hunter Song
* 4 Buddy Holly Song





**Show Fluff & Commentary:**

* *Blue Mountain* came out almost a year ago! I'm loving me some of Bobby's campfire tunes.

* I love me some UJB. You can hear the crowd really getting into it. Love the wild keys, super clear on the mixlr stream.

* Fun Fact: This show was first preformed live in my hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota on 10/19/1971 (Also Keith Godchaux first show).

* I haven't listened to Blue Mountain much since it first came out, but this show is making me think I may need to listen to it more.

* An interesting note from [dead.net](http://www.dead.net/song/bird-song):
> ""Robert Hunter originally wrote the song as a tribute for Janis Joplin. Phil Lesh now sings ""All I know is something like a bird within him sang"", transfering it Jerry Garcia instead.""

* In case anybody wants to follow along with live updates, you can add ""-stream"" after the ""reddit"" in the url, like here: [https://www.reddit-stream.com/comments/6t65v6/](https://www.reddit-stream.com/comments/6t65v6/)

* Ashes, Ashes, All Fall Down! I love how they're jamming on this tune. Gotta enjoy machine gun-like guitar groove that they're rocking with. Very Nice!

* I love the version of *Not Fade Away* on Truckin' Up to Buffalo, which can be streamed on Amazon Prime (along with Long Strange Trip, of course!). The ""You know our love will not fade away chant"" goes on reeeaaal long into the encore break. You gotta love when the crowd is feeling it!

* Great first set!

* A nice slow song to end the show and put me to bed! Thank you all for stopping by and sharing in the groove!

Help on the Way - Your Weekly Listening Thread - 5/16/69 & 10/28/72 - Another HotW Twofer!,"Welcome back to another installment of your weekly listening thread, Help on the Way *!!*

Last week's show was good -- not great.  Not much happened, though it had its moments.  About 100 people streamed the show, which is cool!

This week I'm going to put up two shows because they're both kind of atypical.  The first is a snippet of a show--played in a highschool gym--from 1969.  Even though it wasn't a fulls how I figured it's probably worth a listen:

https://archive.org/details/gd69-05-16.sbd.clugston.6316.sbeok.shnf

Here's the set:

Good Morning Little Schoolgirl [12:08];[0:14] ;
Doin' That Rag [6:00];[3:53] ;
Me And My Uncle [3:28];[0:10] ;
Hard To Handle [4:31];[0:5] ;
Turn On Your Love Light [23:#50]

The second featured show has some mixing issues, apparently, so some of the songs might not be listenable.  Oh well, there's a 27 minute Dark Star!

https://archive.org/details/gd72-10-28.sbd.ashley-bertha.20405.sbeok.shnf

Here's a link with an intro from Dick Latvala:

And the full set:

One	The Promised Land ;

China Cat Sunflower >
I Know You Rider ;
Mexicali Blues ;
Box Of Rain ;
Me And Bobby McGee ;
Candyman ;

Sugar Magnolia [8:18] (2) ;
Casey Jones [8:10]

Encore	Johnny B. Goode [4:03]

Comments	Complete show circulates (11/03). The overall mix is generally light on bass, and sometimes piano, significant mix problems from Box Of Rain into Me & My Uncle Previously the only thing circulating was Dark Star > Sugar Magnolia from Grateful Dead Hour. Setlist from Mr. Goetz (1) Song Map: Dark Star theme/jam {9:24} > restate theme/first verse {1:55} > Jam {2:55} > Philo Stomp {3:30} > Jam {4:20} > tiger {1:08} > Jam {2:04} > Sugar Magnolia {5:18} > pause {0:17} > Sunshine Daydream {2:40}.

Bobby makes chord changes sooner. Bill does double beats and now there is longer pauses between verses.

The Grateful Dead Saved Me and My Marriage,My wife and I went through some dark times. Times I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I developed PTSD as a result. My music was ruined. Every song brought up a bad memory of a past I wanted to leave behind....except a Grateful Dead tune. At the time they were maybe 10% of my library. Because I could listen to the Dead without being triggered of a painful past I began to listen more...and more..and more. I soon discovered that there was a huge world of music beyond American Beauty and Europe 72. Every new song I found brought new joy and what's best is my wife has come on this journey with me. Now the Grateful Dead is 100% of my listening time. They are the soundtrack of our new and better marriage. I'm so thankful for these tunes. They have truly rescued us from a dark past.

"How and why ""Dark Star"" is making a cameo on my next album!","Please let me explain it properly. I'm a brasilian musician. For most of my career, my lyrics and overall songwriting has been inspired in History, Literature, Philosophy and politics.

About two years ago, a very dark depression and anxiety combo took over my life. This came with a major shift in my writing process. It started to become gradually inclined to an introspective, instrumental-oriented autobiographical overview of the fight against mental ilnesses and also about the quiet life - that was my way of fighting back.

My country is also facing very dangerous times. A major political and economical crisis created a very fertile soil for the rise of political polarization and even some far-right-wing ideias started to make a sad comeback.

That's when the Dead kicked in. Since they're not very well known in Brazil, I only knew the surface of their art and stories. Then I decided to have a good listen of ""American Beauty"" and... Well, you know the story. After a few weeks, they became a major influence in my art and my music - and in my life, also. I sort of became that annoying friend that keeps talking about a band.

So, I'm finishing my new album in one or two weeks. Many of the songs drink from the Dead and one of them is specifically about the first time I sat down, turned off the lights and listended to Live/Dead's ""Dark Star."" Even though the album is not ready and I can't really show It to you, It ocurred to me that sharing a bit of this long, strange trip with my fellow deadheads isso something I owe to this band that made such a difference in my life.

Gary Fisher Grateful Dead Mountain Bike,"In 1995 I went to a bike shop in Eugene to get a new mountain bike. I rode a klunker in high school and got my first mountain bike in '85 (a used Fuji Sundance rental bike from the Pt Reyes Bike Shop) and had wanted a Hoo Koo E Koo for years. 

They had a couple, including a limited edition Grateful Dead Hoo Koo E Koo. The standard dark purple HKEK was around $650 and the Grateful Dead HKEK was $850, so after admiring the GD sticker art, I went with the purple one. 

The art used for the stickers was done by Prairie Prince (of The Tubes, Jefferson Starship, Missing Man Formation, etc.) and is very nice. I still have my old purple HKEK as a beater bike but wish I'd had the dollars for the Dead edition. Gary Fisher said that they only sold about a thousand of the Grateful Dead HKEK's.

Need creative advice for birthday cards.,"

We’re celebrating some birthdays at Lockn’ again this year. But things have gone so catastrophically wrong around here that we haven’t had time to put cards together, let alone think of what to put on them. We’re slated to leave later this evening (10-hour drive), so I’m getting more and more nervous about it. I figure in the community spirit of things I could ask for help and maybe get an idea or two.     
.  

 

The cards are foam-core panels that we toted with us, put out markers and [had people sign](http://imgur.com/MHtvgjN). We had [Steal Your Cake](http://imgur.com/o8e3VzL) for the then-six year old,  [The Sun’s Gonna Shine on Link’s Lockn’ Birthday](http://imgur.com/GKil9uV) (Link is short for Lincoln, the then-eight year old), and [Ramble on Lee](http://imgur.com/aXgpk9u) for our five-or-six-decades past the kids festival friend.    
. 



I’ve just begun scratching the surface ideas-wise, plus there’s a new baby in the family. She should actually be the easiest; her nickname is ‘Mars’, so there’s obvious at-the-ready art to work with. Then...?  

* Maybe “Well the birthdays are the greatest days” with a Workingman’s Dead motif. Kind of a stretch.   
* I think for the older friend “Little bit furthur than he’s been before” might work.  
* “Don’t tell me this town’s ain’t got no cake” (Nothin’ bakin’ on Shakedown Street)
* I’m kind of partial to “I wanna tell you how it’s gonna be; you’re gonna sing happy birthday to me”  
* Our little man really digs Cheese, but damned if I can think of something that works. “My brain is just a jellyfish in the ocean of my cake”? “Birthdaymunster”? 

Anyone have an idea?  

Thanks~

Thoughts on Long Strange Trip,"Hey Now- As it happens in life. I was really busy earlier this summer and hadn't had a chance to watch the LST movie yet. For a little background, I'm a huge fan of theirs, I saw them when I could in the 90's ( would have earlier if I could but I was too young), I've read most of the books written about the band, etc... While I enjoyed watching the movie, I was left kind of upset about things left out. I understand you can only fit in so much in 6 parts, but really? There's nothing about Ned Lagin (which I guess is ok), nothing about Tom Constanten (I'm rather ok with that as well), Keith and Donna leaving or Bruce filling in. These are smaller details I understand having to leave out. However, there is next to nothing about Brent, no footage from him speaking, or thoughts from his family. Brent brought so much to the band, and really breathed new light into the band. To gloss over his 11 years with them and what he did for the band is a shame. Of course at this point I'm rambling a bit, but there aren't too many other places to bounce my thoughts about this off. I could go on, and would love to talk more about it and hear others thoughts. Also, I kind of thought they glossed over the amount of heroin and other hard drug use there was as well, but most of their stories do that as well",gratefuldead,1503649040,fillmorewest,74,27,True,2017-08-25

Grateful Dean enigmatically posted ""111121211"" yesterday, although it appears he deleted it (or at least I can no longer find it). I took his post to mean that there will be one November show, 12 in December, and one in January. Based on the tweet, it'll be a mostly east cost swing since the guy broke Hartford as a location.

"I posted this on Game of Thrones board, but mods took it down thinking it was a joke. I'm serious though.","A Dance with Dragons came out in 2011. Everyone was excited (until they finished the book) and it looked like The Winds of Winter may be released in our lifetime. The original release date was some time in 2015 or 2016. Between 2011 and 2015 GRRM was leaking chapters that he had wrote out to the public, either through his website or at various conventions. Things were looking good for a 2015 release.

But then in April 2015 Martin commented on his blog that The Winds of Winter will not be eligible for the 2016 Hugo Award which is awarded for science fiction or fantasy works of the previous year[52] but he also said he would like to have it published before the sixth season of the HBO series Game of Thrones (which would cover material from the book) aired in 2016.

Things then changed in early January 2016, Martin confirmed on his Live Journal that he had not met an end-of-year deadline that he had established with his publisher for release of the book before the sixth season of the HBO show. Martin also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015 that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September 2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable.

On January 10, 2017, Martin announced on his blog in a response to a comment that he believed that The Winds of Winter will be released ""this year"", referring to 2017. However, he also noted that he believed the same thing would occur the previous year. He confirmed on his blog that he was still working on The Winds of Winter as of July 22, 2017, being ""still months away"" from finishing the book. He also indicated that it may not be published until 2018 or later.

So what happened? Why did GRRM think he was going to release the book in 2015, then 2016, then 2017, and now he has no idea?
Because of the Grateful Dead. It should come as no surprise that GRRM is a deadhead. With Jerry Garcia (lead Grateful Dead guitarist/vocalist) passing in 1995, there were few outlets for GRRM to see the music, so his only outlet was to fill the books with references to Grateful Dead songs. This hasn't been a big deal, until 2015. In 2015 the surviving members of the Dead rejoined for their 50th anniversary and had a show in California and a show in Chicago which GRRM was seen at. So that pushed back his initial release date of 2015 from summer to end of the year. Not a big deal... until Dead &amp; Company formed with a few members of the Grateful Dead along with John Mayer. They had a fall/winter tour in 2015 - well there goes the 2015 deadline. No biggy - they can't continue touring, right? They are old. So that's why in January 2016 GRRM thought he could still finish the book.

Nope - Dead &amp; Company loved what they were doing so they announced a summer 2016 tour. And then they did it again in 2017. And now there are rumors of a winter 2017 tour and already dates announced in Mexico in February 2018. My theory is that unfortunately for ASOIAF fans, as long as the band keeps on playing there isn't going to be a book released. Sorry folks.

TL;DR: GRRM is tripping on acid and following the Dead on tour instead of writing.",gratefuldead,1503676780,whyamihereonreddit,11,11,True,2017-08-25

Message to young fellow young heads.. Go tour!,"I was born April 12th 1996. That same month Jerry's ashes were scattered in the Ganges river and San Francisco. I was born a bit too late. This year I hit 15 Dead & Company shows with my best bud, went to loads of National Parks, met strangers who turned into travel companions (We met one group of homies who did the whole west coast tour with us on top of Angel's Landing at Zion National Park!) and went on a journey of a lifetime. It's a dream come true that this is still happening. If you're a younger head like myself and never got to see Jerry this is truly a Deadhead renaissance. All the older heads who have seen all the incarnations since Jerry that I've talked to all agree that Dead and Company is the best. Don't regret not jumping into the magic, folks. I did tour on a budget and so can you!

This message isn't exclusively for younger heads, either! Plain and simple go tour! Go see the American road! You've got wonderful accompaniment music waiting.. See ya'll next tour!

PSA - Google Play Music is the best streaming service I have found for the Grateful Dead,"GPM doesn't really get the attention that Spotify or Apple does but there are a few unique things to this service that should appeal to this community.

- Album selection is at parity with Spotify
- GPM comes with YouTube Red.  This means countless hours of ad free grateful dead and Jgb videos.  Many many ad free full shows thanks to Voodoonola and many others.
- Free YouTube music app allows you to just listen to all of that YouTube library on your phone on the go.  Want some of that sweet acoustic Jerry in 82? It's right there.
- Last but not least is the music locker.  You can store up to 50,000 of your own songs in Google Play Music.  Those can then be downloaded to your device or any device in the family plan.  I have the whole Dead and Co 2017 tour available on all devices.  It's amazing!

I switched from Spotify early this year and don't see going back.  I could see where these differences might not make a difference for some, or even most.  But the offering is oddly fantastic for Dead fans.",gratefuldead,1499746993,Staggerlee024,16,14,True,2017-07-11

How to do tour on a budget and support your brothers and sisters,"I saw an earlier thread with folks urging kids to just get out there and tour. If you sell a case of water, earn your gas money, a bit more and you got food. Excellent idea, but I would like to take it a bit further. 

A lot of the fun of the scene has to do with all the cool stuff you see on the lot. Get creative! Make a sticker or T-shirt. Make some jewelry or do some art. Even if you don't sell a lot, you can trade. I can't count how many stickers I have traded for grilled cheeses!
But most of all, support your scene! Don't go to a diner after the show when there are plenty of kids selling food. And if you do make a little extra, spread the wealth. Your purchase just may be that little extra that helps a head get to one more show. ",gratefuldead,1499774885,Festafarian,8,18,True,2017-07-11

"AMA with Dead & Co bassist/vocalist Oteil Burbridge 3 p.m. ET (12 p.m. PT) Friday, July 14 on /r/GRATEFULDEAD!","This Friday at 3 p.m. ET (12 p.m. PT) /r/GratefulDead welcomes [Oteil Burbridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP2IbZq87Zs&feature=youtu.be) of Dead & Company for an AMA!

Sure, [Oteil](http://oteilburbridge.com/) plays bass and sings for D&C, but he's also...

> ...an American multi-instrumentalist, specializing on the bass guitar, trained in playing jazz and classical music from an early age. He has achieved fame primarily on bass guitar during the resurgence of the Allman Brothers Band from 1997 through 2014. He was also a founding member of the bands Dead & Company and The Aquarium Rescue Unit, and has worked with other musicians including Col. Bruce Hampton, Trey Anastasio and Page McConnell of Phish, Bill Kreutzmann and The Derek Trucks Band, with whom his brother Kofi Burbridge is keyboardist and flautist. [More...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oteil_Burbridge)

Oteil has [this to say about playing with D&C](https://www.jambase.com/article/making-peace-with-the-low-end-oteil-burbridge-talks-dead-co-allmans-more):

> I was psyched but it sure sounded crazy. The Dead with Mayer? I had learned some of their songbook before but probably only about 15 or so tunes. I was in a trio with Kreutzmann and Scott Murawski called BK3. Mike Gordon turned me onto that gig. He was the bassist in it before I was. I was and still am game for living out in left field though. I was like, “Let’s do this!”

> Who wouldn’t take this gig? I knew I would like playing the music of the Grateful Dead in almost any lineup as long as it was with people who really loved the music. Plus, I just had my first child a mere nine months prior to getting the gig. What an amazing opportunity career-wise. The biggest one of my entire life. I’ve never played stadiums before!

Where should I start?,"For background on my music taste, I'm usually into things like The Beatles, The Beach Boys (less their rock, more *out there* pop), The Byrds, Genesis, King Crimson, Zappa (moreso his explorations into interesting sounds and compositions, less his humorous sort of stuff albeit I love that too) 

I've heard that there's nothing really quite like The Dead, and that they have something for everyone. Country, bluegrass, psychedelia, hell, even experimental sorta jazz stuff.

I've listened to American Beauty, which is where a lot of people I've talked to said I should start, and I've got to admit, I like it, but I don't know where else to go to. It didn't really *grab* me like I thought it would although I really enjoy what they're doing there. 
I really want to delve into their less accessible psychedelic stuff, but I've also seen that I shouldn't be focusing solely on their studio recordings. I'm no stranger to the ""live show collection"" trading and stuff like that, because the Genesis fanbase is the same way, but it seems very intimidating, especially because I don't have a basis besides just American Beauty.

From the Vault blotter art,"I'm curious if anyone here has seen this print floating around, not asking for how heavy it's dosed as I know it can vary greatly from sheet to sheet, it just looks real old and I was told it's been in their head stash for awhile.  

From my research it appears to be similar to the [""from the vault""](https://shakedowngallery.com/blogs/news/113054724-grateful-dead-from-the-vault-blotter-art-released) print released awhile ago but mine isn't quite like what shows up on google. 

It's the same style print, but behind the vault is a golden stealie and the rest of the print looks like it's the same design repeated with small bolts with spirals in them in between the main design that's repeated. It's not one big image like the linked one but rather multiple small versions of that image. 

Sorry if my explanation isn't that great, I honestly didn't want to just post up my sheet and be that guy spamming the sub with my dose. I can post up a picture of it if anyone's curious, I'm just more interested in finding out if it's an older print or not because it definitely looks that way.

Recreating the Wall of Sound?,"Since I watched Long Strange Trip I have been thinking about the Wall of Sound.  Has anyone ever tried to re-create the (a?) Wall of Sound?  I know that PA's are much clearer and more powerful now, not to mention smaller and cheaper.  Still, it seems as if the physics are much different than the speaker banks on each side of the stage as is common now.  
I know there are different Dead cover bands all over the country and from some of the stage setups/instrumentation I assume have quite a bit of money.  It's kind of surprising that no one has tried to re-create the Wall.  Is it the fact that these bands play venues that have/insist on using their own PA?  It would be much more expensive than using a traditional system of 2 banks of speakers and re-mixing a stereo image, but on balance speakers/equipment are cheaper and smaller and lighter than they were in 1973.
I can think of a million reasons not to re-create a wall of sound, but it seems as if it would be cool as hell to see it done.  ",gratefuldead,1500063912,Slpry_Pete,20,11,True,2017-07-14

Praise for Dead and Co,"Probably unlike a lot of you I never saw the Dead live as I was 4 when Jerry died. No one in my immediate family was a big fan, but a few years back my uncle and cousin got me into them. Since 2014 there hasn't been a week I've went without listening to their music. I didn't get the chance to see any of the reunion work live until this summer when I managed to convert a few friends into casual fans. 

I saw the second night at Fenway and couldn't have been more satisfied. 90% of people wearing Dead shirts and somehow there was still a huge variety. Most of the other shows I go to see are smaller acts, often with multiple openers or joint shows where half the audience is there to see the guys I've never heard of, or to party indifferent to who's even playing. The sense of community at Fenway was just awesome. 

For me of course the experience wasn't as nostalgic but it was like all of a sudden something I had only looked at in a historical view was fast forwarded into the present. Most of my background knowledge comes from reading memoirs and watching the recent documentaries... like I was studying their history. Actually seeing it and finding that the music really has never stopped was an experience I'll always remember. I can't wait to see Dead and Co again next tour. My sole complaint would be that I'd really like to see Phil live too. ",gratefuldead,1500177130,downwithsocks,2,19,True,2017-07-15

I don't want to get anyone's hopes up and keep in mind that my parents sold their Dead and Co tix this summer and when the whole show was broadcasted (ATL) he watched it and said watching it from home was ""much better"".

Dead and Company - Grateful Dead,"So in response to some comment I made today someone posted the following:

*""As for the people comparing this to GD, your missing the point and the culture has outgrown you. Step inside and see the new paint and sit on the updated furniture that is the music. Bob Weir is a ICON and so is the rest of the survivors of GD. These shows and band is not a attempt to recreate the GD experiencing but more of a exploration to find the new.""*

And that got me thinking about whether or not it is a valid thing to compare Dead and Company to The Grateful Dead. Leave aside for the time being that it is perfectly valid for anyone to compare the experience, music and anything else for one band to another - this being a matter of personal taste.

But really are you missing the point and has the culture outgrown you if you do compare Dead and Company and the Grateful Dead? I don't know, haven't made up my mind, but I guess I will before we're done with this thread.

The question I guess is defining what exactly Dead and Company is. Is this an extension of the Grateful Dead, and offshoot of the Grateful Dead, a Dead Cover band, a Dead Tribute band, or something else? The fact of the matter is that they are definitely related to the Grateful Dead beyond just sharing three members. Let's start with the name - Dead and Company (so even the band drags the Grateful Dead into the name). Look at the symbology - Stealies, bears, 13-point lightning bolts, skeleton, roses, flying eyeballs, terrapins, The Bus, VW buses/campers, Bertha, Skeleton with lute, etc. It's all there and those are all undoubtedly Grateful Dead symbols, and chosen for themselves and adopted by the band. This isn't something the audience is hoisting on them. Then  there are the songs. Other than 1 song they play, all the rest are either Grateful Dead songs or songs covered by the Grateful Dead on a regular basis (the exception being A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall).

I remember an interview with Chris Cornell in which they were talking about his cover of Billie Jean and he said a good cover is one that sticks to some of the basics but then makes the song your own. By that standard Dead and Company could be a GD cover band.

But a full 50% of the band members are a part of the original GD. If King Crimson can call itself King Crimson and have Robert Fripp as the only original member, then  saying that Dead and Company is an extension of the GD isn't a stretch. 

The fact that their approach to the songs is different than GD's raises the issue that would you call GD's approach to Estimated in 1990 the same as GD's approach to Estimated in 1977? Or how about GD's approach to Dark Star in 1990 compared to GD's approach to Dark Star in 1969? So is this just another band along the same evolutionary path and of course since the GD had at least two players with a completely unique style - Jerry and Phil, you can't expect this evolution to sound the same. Not unless people try emulate Jerry and Phil, and we've already seen what Fake Jerry does to people's mental well being.

So is it valid to compare the Dead and Company experience to the Grateful Dead experience. Well you go into a show, you listen to the same songs you would have in a GD show, with a twist to them (which would also be normal from one GD show to another), would it be normal to make a comparison?

I understand that there may be people at shows today who never saw the Grateful Dead and hence can't make a first hand comparison. But that's no different to someone like me who never saw the Grateful Dead play a  small venue like the Avalon, or a show in say 1968. That was a completely different side of the band and by the time I got on the bus in the late 70s, it was much bigger playing venues that held 5-12,000 people, and by the end they were pulling in close to 100,000 people on some shows. And of course the musical style had changed dramatically. Compare a show like 3/15/1990 or 3-29-1990 to say 5/anything/1977.

So as I thought, by the time I finished typing this I have managed to convince myself. Yes it is a valid thing to compare the two. Yes it's new paint and new furniture, but just like you would compare a home before and after a remodeling, it's valid. And just because it is different doesn't mean  it's outgrown anyone. Some people may actually have like the old decor better. Doesn't mean they can't like the new, or use the new. Just liked the old better - just like I like chocolate cake better than carrot cake. Still like them both. ",gratefuldead,1500235786,wolfbysilverstream,33,23,True,2017-07-16

Country Influences and the Bakersfield Sound,"I'm looking for any and all resources and content related to the country influences of Grateful Dead and the country musicians they played with in the late 60s and early 70s. 

I've always preferred the early Dead sound, the bluesy country is where I think they really shined. I know they had cross pollination with New Riders of the Purple Sage and Flying Burrito Brothers. I know they went up to Bakersfield and let that sound influence them a lot, which is what drove a lot of the sound in Workingman's Dead and American Beauty. I know of David Nelson and Gram Parsons, but not much beyond a couple studio albums and a few bands they were in. 

What I'm asking is for anyone with any type of memory or vault or anything like that. Dig in a bit and let me know what you find. Any information is good information, even if it's just a story you want to tell. 

What was the nature of the relationship between Grateful Dead and New Riders of the Purple Sage, and Flying Burrito Brothers as well? What other bands and musicians from the Country/Bakersfield scene did Grateful Dead work with? What other bands from that scene influenced them, if they didn't work directly together?

Tangentially, what are the lesser known bands from the Bakersfield scene, that I could listen to to get a feel for the scene as a whole? On the flip side of that, what are the well known bands that are a 'must-listen' for anyone getting into it? This isn't limited to just bands that interacted with GD. 

And as a side mission, where does David Crosby fit in with all this? Was David and the Dorks just a one-off show or did they work together more?

I suppose my interest here isn't specifically about Grateful Dead. Really what it is, is that Grateful Dead has made me aware of the Bakersfield sound. And I want to know more about that sound, in the context of how it interacted with the San Francisco sound, and how the musicians of each scene influenced each other. And tangentially, anything about the cross pollination between country/western/folk and psychedelic/blues/rock. 

And of course, any live recordings are greatly appreciated. 

As a reward for reading this far... here's some NRPS with Jerry.

"""And Company"" of Dead & Co","I have recently been thinking about the ""and Company"" aspect of Dead & Company, and I feel like it falls in line with what Bob has alluded to in interviews by just keeping the music alive. I do not mean permanent replacements but more guest spots a la Phil & Friends (if you look at the wiki page it is a long, impressive list of friends) or last year when Donna came out on stage for a few shows.

John mentioned in the Tales 7/17 interview that this tour is the first time since 2015 that Dead & Co felt like a band, and not a project. I am not sure if potentially bringing it new people will knock it back down to ""project"" feels but I feel like this could be the direction Dead & Co might be going in, if they choose to continue touring.

And I know Mayer talked recently on Tales from Golden Road about how they'll write setlists out to make sure song spacing and all that is played out.

When did setlists start getting made? Was it the 80s when they had a huge catalog and had to space more stuff out to the make sure it all got played? Was it only after Jerry's passing? If you have links or anything I'm interested.",gratefuldead,1500655881,zacattac,19,17,True,2017-07-21

Are Parliament-Funkadelic (P-Funk) the closest thing there is to a black Grateful Dead?,"Ive been a fan of George Clinton and P-Funk for a long time, and cant help but see many similarities to the Dead. Just a few of the reasons I can think of: 

1. They are heavily influenced by LSD and psychadelic culture (as well as Coke, Heroin and other drugs)
2. They play loose jammy seemingly endless sets
3. They have lots of great psychadelic imagery associated with them (google Pedro Bell)
4. Their music was a fusion of all the great (black) american genres (soul, r&b, funk, rock, blues etc.)
5. CONSTANT touring, even today

So do you agree? Are there many other Deadheads here into P-Funk? I think the greatest tragedy is that there is not an archive of all their shows like there is with the Dead. Just a couple live albums and some shows on youtube.

Best SOUNDING recordings?,"I've been listening to the Grateful Dead on and off since I was 14 years old.

Tour was great! But...,"I've been thinking about tour recently. I did 16 shows this past tour, hitting all of the west coast and some of the east coast shows as well. I've had an amazing experience doing so. 

However, one thing bothered me. My friends been trying to get me tuned onto phish, so I opened their webcast and watched it. Not really a big fan of the music, but curious nevertheless.

Whenever I'd be at dead shows, I would notice that so many people would be on their phones. Nearly a quarter of the pit at any given time would be taking pictures, videos, etc. I counted only 4 max whenever the camera panned towards the crowds at the Phish shows. The fact that I could count them was stunning enough. I've watched live webcasts of Dead and Company too, and I'd still see a significant part of the pit just taking pictures. And there's nothing wrong with that, I take maybe 10 pictures in a short burst, maybe a video, but never do I spend half the show on my phone.

Not to mention, when I would watch videos of Alpine shows or old Shoreline shows with the dead, everyone would be dancing. There were a few that weren't, but for a most part, it was pretty livid. At the Phish shows, it was the whole pit moving, not just bits and parts. The pit is mostly stagnant at the Dead and Company shows.

I'm not bashing on Dead and Company in any way, nor am I a big fan of Phish. I've seen D&C about 20 times given past tours. I just really wish more people would listen to the music play, and hope so on the next tour.

Just a little rant. Just things I've noticed (along with people never knowing when to be quiet. Standing on the Moon was hard to hear at Wrigley night one this year because of how loud everyone was talking.) 

Again, I love the Dead with all my heart, and the lovely community as well! But it just irks me that some people go to these shows and don't even listen to the music play. 

Love you all, just wanted to hear your thoughts on this.",gratefuldead,1500721791,Olek173,23,3,True,2017-07-22

As a keyboard player, I often find myself daydreaming about the limits of the instrument.

His style is everything that a keyboard can do in a rock and roll context - I love him but he has no solo work.  This led me down the Bruce Hornsby rabbit hole, and all I can say is, boy, is it a rewarding body of work.  I highly encourage anyone interested to give some Bruce a spin.

Mexico shows theory,"So here's the way I look at it. I think the boys are doing these shows for a few reasons. First off, they probably get a few week or two stay at a top notch resort in Mexico to play. That's a pretty sweet deal for them. Bobby's old and I bet he loves the beach. Checkers is probably gonna show off some checkers at the beach. The environment of playing at the beach, the vibe, and the mood also probably make the shows really fun to play. I don't think they're doing this to ""Cater to the rich"" like some people are saying. If they were doing that, they wouldn't have done a fairly large US tour all summer at reasonable prices. I think they're just going to have a good time at beach and play some cool tunes. ",gratefuldead,1501006494,Rhuey13,18,10,True,2017-07-25

It is going to be my 1st vacation in a long time. I have had many challenges over the last 9 years.  Lost my job of 12 years due to my company fucking so many of us over. My wife went crazy. (Real mental illness) divorced me at 45 with 16 years of marriage.  Been spending the last 3.5 years trying to get her help but nothing worked. I also have started my life over.  
I went back to what makes me happy.  Listen to a lot of The Dead.  Got me my Harley.  Back to being true to myself.  
I will also be spending time with my bff and his wife before they leave to teach overseas for two years.  He been my friend for 29 years.  He has seen me at my best and worst.  He took care of me one night when i took way to much acid (1000ug).  Got to love a guy who forgives you for pissing all over his living room. In my defense i thought it was the bathroom.

In my opinion after using it for a few days I really enjoyed the feel and look of it, oh and I also did a fun little thing with the images so every time you open a show on archive and have the extension enabled you should see a different picture every time :D  
  
Anyway, I hope to hear some feedback on UI here just to make sure that most people agree it looks nice. Also, spread the word about this extension to any groups/forums you may be apart of that would benefit from it. I love watching the weekly users graphs that google chrome provides.   

For anyone interested, the stats on average look like:    
- Anywhere from 3-15 installations per day  
- ~200-300 impressions per day (how many people view it in store)  
- Total current users has completely flatlined over the past 6 months and hovers somewhere around 3,300-3,500

"Is ""Death Don't Have No Mercy"" the darkest Grateful Dead song?","Listening to 9/29/89 right now and can't help but think this has got to be the darkest song in the Dead's catalogue.

"Dead and Company - Dark Star - 6/1017 - Boulder, Colorado","I'm sharing this because I think it was an absolutely fantastic performance that everyone needs to see. I think it's a prime example of a great jam and shows off the band. John's guitar playing is perfect and Jeff's keyboards are also. This is easily one of the best Dark Stars I have ever heard, including with Jerry.

I've been wanting to get into the 73-74 years of the Dead and someone here suggested that Winter of 73 is absolutely incredible. I have only listened to a few shows from this year but this show is insane. The HCS might be the best I've heard so far and that DS is incredible at 43 mins long, I feel like i'm taking a trip through the universe with this one. The Eyes>Stella Blue after the DS is just pure beauty. The rest of the show isn't to shabby either! Anyway just thought id share this show in hopes of maybe someone hasn't heard it yet. After some thinking i believe this might be one of my favorite shows although I probably haven't even scratched the surface with this band yet

Thoughts from my first Dead show,"To preface this, I'm 15 years old, and have been listening to the Dead my entire life. My parents are both Deadheads, and raised me right. (Listening to the Dead almost religiously) I went to see 'The Dead' at Red Rocks in 2004, but obviously I can't remember that.


I went to see Dead & Co last night with my mom and a couple friends, and holy shit. I absolutely fucking loved it. They hit most the songs I wanted to hear, everyone was in sync, John killed it, the crowd was incredible, Shakedown was good, (At least in my view) and I had the best time of my life. Honest to whatever God is out there, I doubt anything in the rest of my life will top the experience I had on 6/10/17. I can't find any one thing to complain about except the outrageous prices at Folsom.


I never thought I'd be able to see the Grateful Dead, and even though Dead & Co isn't the same, it's pretty damn close, and really damn good.",gratefuldead,1497226508,DTConcepts,31,51,True,2017-06-11

Long shot: Did any of you see The Other Ones on 7-17-98 at Riverport Amphitheater?,"I have this vague memory of driving past the amphitheater when I was a kid and seeing a big colorful hoopla on the side of the road, and my mom explaining that it was ""Deadheads."" We did the math, and the only date it could have been was 7-17-98. The thing is, I know it would have been a Sunday that we were driving past (on the way to church) but 7-17-98 was a Friday. 

So what I'm wondering is, did the lot scene linger until Sunday after the Friday show? The band was already in Colorado for another show by then, so it seems like the scene would have left by then, but I don't know how long people typically stuck around. 

I know it's a weird question and a long shot, but I'm too young to have ever seen the band, so I wanted to look up the closest show they've ever done to me and listen online.

I wish D&C would play more Jerry ballads,"To Lay Me Down, So Many Roads, Comes a Time, Ship of Fools, ....

I believe none of those have been played, with the exception of SoF, which was played once back in 2015.  I think Mayer and Oteil's voices are more than good enough to do these songs justice, and I am a huge fan of the jamming the band does in the middle of the Jerry ballads already in their repertoire.  I'd love to see them play stuff like Standing on the Moon and Days Between more often too.  

I wouldn't mind them toning down the rock songs (Casey Jones, OMSN, China Rider, etc.) a bit in favor of some slower, more emotional stuff.  Doesn't have to be super often, but given how frequently they're playing the more up-tempo tunes, they could definitely make room.",gratefuldead,1497231245,Grateful_Dan,12,10,True,2017-06-11

Recent John Mayer Interview/Dead Fandom,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCvnOYNzpj4

(D&C discussion beings at 13:40)

Not sure if this has been posted already, but Mayer has some beautiful things to say about Jerry and his legacy and about what Dead and Co means to him.  He also has some interesting thoughts on Dead fandom and how Heads could be more welcoming to newcomers. Best of all, he says he'll be playing this music for the rest of his life. 

I think his comments on accessibility of the music is astute.  It took a long time for many of us to really *get* the Dead--but once we do reached that mountaintop, as Mayer puts it, it was truly life-changing.  Personally, it took me years of casual listening before the music of the Dead became an obsession.  It even took this literal generational guitar talent (Mayer) himself awhile to ""get"" it.  He talks about listening to songs in a certain order to fully grasp what's going on--I'd be curious to hear him go more in-depth about that.  Getting people into the music, whether just to find a concert buddy or to ensure the music endures into the next generation and beyond, is really difficult.  I would love to learn how to make the music more accessible.

Post show depression,"Ugh. I really hate that feeling. Here I am, 8:21am Monday morning. Mere hours from work when not 72hrs ago my entire town was Dead. I loved the showshere in Boulder. I was shocked last year when they announced them as they hadn't  had a show at Folsom in 15 years. The whole town turns into deadheadland.

Some of my best childhood friends flew into town for this show and they met my best friends here. My oldest dead friends, who I've been going to shows with for 12 years, were here for these shows. We had a group of over 15 people that we herded into the show together. Everyone on their enhancement of choice, having a group psychedelic experience. I love living in Boulder but a special thanks to all who put on his event for letting everyone enjoy themselves in a safe and respectful manner. Did not see a single incident all weekend.

Now it's back to work. Ugh.... it's enough to make me want to drop it all and go on tour. The dead truly feel like home to me. As they have since I first saw ratdog. 

Then it struck me today.... this will all end. They are all getting older and eventually they will all go the way of Phil and stop touring then they will go the way of Jerry... I always need just one more show...

I don't want to be negative...,"But- my wife and I travelled to Boulder for both shows this weekend. They were obviously fantastic.  However, Saturday night the chatter was relentless.  People everywhere around us were talking throughout both sets, every song. Especially noticeable during china doll and Stella blue. 

The talking was so pervasive there wouldn't have been much value asking anyone to stop. We moved a few times, and we were mostly in the upper sections. Mostly younger folks but some older too. It was pretty sucky. I'm hoping it had more to do with the venue (GA only- no assigned seating) as I didn't experience the same behavior in ampitheatre settings. 

I'm not one to tell anyone else how to have an experience, but also don't like my experiences to be disrupted either. 

I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir- but had to share.

How bad are the cheap seats at Wrigley?,"This would be my first Dead show. $35 dollar tickets to the tour ending shows seems too good to pass up. I have a friend that lives in town that I can stay with, so it would just be a 7.5 hour drive for me. 

Anyone ever been to a concert a Wrigley with the same stage setup? I've been to a baseball game at Wrigley, but we had bleacher seats. I guess what I'm getting at is, are the bad seats at Dead shows a good way to experience the show? Especially a first show? I can't really justify buying a more expensive ticket; I probably shouldnt  even buy the cheap one, but I just feel like I need to do this. 

Sorry for the rambling post, I'm just weighing a lot of pros and cons in my head right now. ",gratefuldead,1497318281,Jdf121,21,3,True,2017-06-12

We met on the floor night one in Boulder and I didn't get your number.,"You appeared in my vicinity sometime during the second set, we made eye contact and you approached me. We introduced ourselves and shook hands you say your name is Christy and that you traveled from Texas for the show. We smoked a joint together as the psychedelic energy continued to build in the crowd, tearing down the structure of time space itself. People all around were in and out of body, switching body matter, teleporting around seamlessly in the blink of an eye. Its an amazing thing to witness first hand that our individual bodies are just cells of the larger organism that is us/everything. I remember you turned to me saying ""I'm like in and out of completely losing it"" as was I. We stood there aw struck by the beauty of the moment. You grabbed me and hugged me tight for what seemed like forever. I felt eternal bliss as our bodies merged into one. Eyes closed I saw only golden white light. I can't get the moment we shared out of my head. If you are out there please responded with my name and or a description of the shirt i was wearing.

My last show was Shoreline 07-03-94...can't bring myself to see The Dead without Jerry.,"I am an eighties head.  I haven't really kept up with the boys since Jerry died.  I am not sure that I could enjoy seeing a Dead and Co. show.  RIP Jerry.

I do still listen to The Dead regularly.  I still listen to my tapes. To date, I have never listened to any of the post-Jerry Dead songs.  

So, older heads, what's been your experience at these shows?  It's been 22 years since I've been to a live show, and I kinda miss the music and the scene.

The Best Shows,"Here is the list of some fire dead shows that everyone should check out, I am not done putting my discription of each show yet, but I am close to being done... I think:

Peak performances:

8/27/72 Sunshine Daydream

Every song is straight fire and could be considered as their best version of each song. Every song that appears on this album usually wins for the best version, but there are still other poppin versions of the songs from this show. China Cat Sunflower> I know You rider is the best ever. An epic Dark Star. Deal sounds like freight Train going down the tracks.

8/13/75 One From The Vault

Is a really tight show with the entirety of Blues for Allah and is definitely one of their best. Arguably the best Help>Slipknot>Music Never Stopped ever played. The best EOTW>Drums. GDTRFB has a really cool mix of standard and half time for the drums when its first starting.

5/8/77 Cornell

This is a fucking tight 77 show. not my favorite 77 show but from general consensus and the performance of the show it is a must. it has the best Dancing in the streets ever performed. also a great They Love Each Other

Great acoustic shows:

5/2/70 Dick's Picks Vol. 8

The acoustic set is golden. The electric set has a really intense Other One.

5/15/70 Road Trips Vol. 3 Num. 3

The acoustic set is just as good as 5/2 but a little less acclaimed. St. Stephen from the early show, China>rider, Cumberland Blues, and Hard to Handle are all good.

Reckoning

Great Shows:

8/24/68 Two From The Vault

This has one of the coolest Dark Stars ever played. It has such a cool 60's psychedelic sound.

2/11/69 Live at the Fillmore East 2-11-69

11/8/69 Dick's Picks Vol. 16

The Entire Second set is one the master pieces of the live dead

1/23/70 Dave's Picks Vol 19

I features some songs that cant be found in 5/2 or 5/15 but is a really good 70 show. probably my favorite from the year that isn't acoustic. It also marks the transition of the Dead into playing more individual songs instead of a bunch of songs linked together.

2/13/70 Dick's Picks Vol. 4

This and the next night tend to be alot of peoples favorite shows, but I like others more.

2/14/70 Dick's Picks Vol. 4

4/25/71 - 4/29/71 Ladies and Gentlemen... the Grateful Dead/ Skull and Roses

The Dead were straight rock and roll at this time and it makes everything fast, distorted and true fire.

11/15/71 Road Trips Volume 3 Number 2

Dark Star>El Paso> Dark Star

4/8/72 Europe 72

Cumberland Blues, Brown Eyed Women

4/26/72 Europe 72

One of the best Europe 72 shows played. One really cool the Other One. Bertha is really good and has one of the best Turn On Your Love Lights since 70.

5/3/72 Europe 72

5/7/72 Europe 72

The whole show is good. It has much more of a 71 sound to it compared to the rest of Europe 72.

5/26/72 Europe 72

Usually a crowd favorite among Europe 72, but first set a little rickety to me. Second set is on.

11/21/73 Road Trips Volume 4 Number 3

12/10/73 Grateful Dead Download Series Volume 8

5/14/74 Dave's Picks Vol. 9

6/26/74 Dick's Picks Vol.12 

A fire China Cat Sunflower> I know You Rider

10/16/74 - 10/20/74 Steal Your Face/ The Grateful Dead Movie Soundtrack

6/18/76 Grateful Dead Download Series Volume 4

A really killer set even though its mostly mellower songs. One really good Music Never Stopped and a good Big River.

4/30/77 Grateful Dead Download Series Volume 1

A really good 77 show. probably my favorite spring 77 Bertha and my favorite 77 Scarlet>Fire. The Music never Stops is on point and Keith has a really unique sound this show for the song.

5/13/77 May 1977

Holy Shit. This should be the show people go to instead of 5/8/77 in my opinion but just give it a listen. GDTRFB>OMSN, US Blues closes the show and its an absolute knock out. Probably the tightest One More Saturday Night Band Ever Played. Also Donna Kills Cassidy.

5/19/77 Dicks Picks Vol. 29

The best Estimated Profit

5/28/77 To Terrapin

Real similar to 5/13/77 but a little more laid back song wise compared to 5/13/77.

9/3/77 Dick's Picks Vol. 15

11/4/77 Dave's Picks Vol. 12

Its a really good show and shows the beginning of the 78 dead.

7/1/78 July 1978: The Complete Recordings

The whole show is amazing. they showed up 2 hours after they were suppose to go on an played 45 minutes over. It was Willie Nelsons birthday celebration and the dead knocked it out with this show. the beginning of the first set is fantastic but Friend of the Devil> Me and My Uncle>Big River is one of the coolest pieces of music the dead performed in their career. Also has one of their best Terrapin Stations and one of their best Playing in the Band's. Also a really good Wharf Rat.

7/5/78 July 1978: The Complete Recordings

Beat on Down The Line has a cool intro by Kieth and once the song starts Jerry starts playing faster then almost any other time in the history of the dead. Its all over now is probably my favorite version from the Godchaux era.

7/8/78 Red Rocks

Bertha, New Minglewood Blues, Deal, Wharf Rat>Franklin's Tower>Sugar Magnolia

5/15/80 Go To Nassau

Jack Straw>Franklin's Tower, China>Rider, GDTRFB>Good Lovin. Has one of the best GDTRFB's ever played.

5/16/80 Go To Nassau

Dead and company songs in your city,Anyone else listening to the dead and company shows this year feel a little bit of disappointment whenever you hear a song you really want in your city? they only play the songs in their repertoire a few times per tour and each time it is played the probability of hearing it in your city decreases.

I saw Dead and Company tonight. First live experience which was Grateful Dead related...,"And it was fantastic. Not necessarily a show. It was, yes, performance. And music on stage which, typically, designates a show. But they didn't feel like they were just there to perform. They were there to play. And I loved it.

Also, a new standard for tattoos was set tonight. Previously, my standard for odd tattoos was deadpool riding the metal unicorn from Robot Unicorn Attack...but someone topped that tonight, and as a bit of an open letter to this guy... If you are the man with what looked to me (who was sober) to be a trippy, rainbow-color tattoo of JFK's smiling face on your right hand...bravo. I didn't know I needed a rainbow-sheen John F Kennedy tattoo to be part of my experience beforehand, but whoever did your artwork nailed it.

Bass levels,I need them up. I've been to 8 shows this tour and except when he sings China Doll I've thought about Oteil like twice because I can never hear him. What's the deal? I get maybe they're doing something different but I don't think the Grateful Dead ever had the bass this low and barely noticeable ,gratefuldead,1497416561,woahdude12321,4,5,True,2017-06-14

Thoughts on John's playing in ATL,"First off, what a great fucking show! Set list was outstanding, not a dud in it. And how cool was that lightning storm behind the stage?

This is all in reference to John's improvising during jams

1) didn't it seem like he was hesitant to step out on a ledge? Seemed like he kept backing off from really grabbing the reins and relied heavily on effects. The effects were rad and all but it confused me because Weir has said that they picked Mayer for his ability to listen, not necessarily play. 

Which leads me to 

2) John did not seem to pay attention to the rest of the band much during jams. There were multiple times when either the rhythm section or the entire rest of the band had developed motifs that John kinda just plowed through. 

The only time this didn't really seem to be the case was in Knockin on Heaven's door.

Some thoughts and questions on Long Strange Trip Doc. May contain spoilers,"So, for background, Deadhead since 1987. Was introduced by older people at Jewish Summer Camp. My first show was Meadowlands, 1987. I got into the ""scene"" old school--- and when I get into something, I get INTO it. From Kesey to Kerouac, from Wolfe to Winterland '77, from Relix when it was just about the Dead to Dupree's Diamond News...

Anyway, for me there were new pics but not much new information. Plus, there was a LOT missing or not elaborated on enough. Yeah, for all the info it would have been a 24+ hour movie--- but here are things I'd like to know more about that I felt were missing:

1. Deborah Koons Garcia
2. Mountain Girl Garcia
3. Manasha Garcia
4. Bruce Hornsby
5. Jill Lesh
6. How the Dead were influenced by all music styles, and were the epitome of American Influence from Folk to Jazz to R&R
7. How being so anti-authority is also so American
8. Lack of any Politics from the Band
9. SEVA
10. OOlampali
11. The Whys of Keith and Donna leaving
12. Bill Graham
13. The special connections to SF and NYC
14. The Influence of the Beats

I gotta go to work, but if I think of more, I'll edit

How about that John Mayer and Dave Chapelle show?,"Once in a lifetime chance. Great to see John play some of his own songs and hear him and Dave chat about all things life.

Edit: since you guys asked, the show was awesome. Dave was a bit late so John boy started us off with a few acoustic  songs, Real World, Neon, the like. He was rocking a Jean jacket with a Stealie on the back. Then he grabbed the electric and started playing Voodoo Child (Slight Return) as Dave walked on. Dave did a few jokes then John came out and sat on the stage with his Strat just noodling along and talking with Dave. It honestly felt like we were just hanging out at their house listening to them talk. To close out the night they had a bomb ass harmonica player come out to play some blues with John and finish it off with a cover of Purple Rain for Prince.",gratefuldead,1497461306,chivesthelefty,14,29,True,2017-06-14

Weird coincidences at the Atlanta show,"I was vending yesterday, and one of the things I always like to do is, ask ""What do you want to hear tonight?""

Another kid, who was seeing his first show, really wanted Playin. Then a little girl, about 8, came by with her mother. Mom said she really likes jazz. I told her they played Coltrane earlier in the tour, so.... and of course, you know they played Miles, which btw, is my dog's name.

I'm sure someone else could describe their style of playing better than I could but it's like Grateful Dead tunes done in a Jazz way. They were the reason I got into the Grateful Dead in the first place. I heard Help slip Frank on Jazz Is dead's first album and I got hooked. Been listening to their second album the past hour. The Weather Report Suite album. Pretty cool to hear Derek Trucks play on Row Jimmy. Take care!

John Barlow in Long Strange Trip,"What did you guys think of John Barlow's interviews in the documentary?  He struck me as kind of a sour grape and had a lot of negative things (some of which are probably justified) about the band and the surrounding scene.  Yet at the same time, he constantly used the royal 'we' to refer to the Grateful Dead.  

Something about that really rubbed me the wrong way.  While he helped write some dearly beloved songs, he wasn't a performing member of the band.  It felt like he was trying to prop himself up as an insider, while simultaneously shitting on the band and the organization.  I'm pretty much a GD neophyte - been listening to them for a while but have only recently started to dig deep, so please don't jump down my throat.  I'm just curious what some of you seasoned heads think about the guy and his take on the Grateful Dead.

EDIT:  Thanks for the thoughtful responses, guys.  Sounds like using 'we' was very common among the organization.  It's clear that the fanbase has immense respect for Barlow and I look forward to learning more about him and his perspective.",gratefuldead,1497627096,GamehendgeBrewingCo,23,7,True,2017-06-16

Not only were the audiences become bigger and the venues less intimate but I don't know exactly people started deifying him, which probably got him to be even more silent.

Please tell a millennial what this Bruce Hornsby song meant to you?,"I am putting this here because Bruce Hornsby does not have his own sub reddit that I can find

I went down a deep Youtube rabbit hole of 80's music.  It started with ACDC, Halen and Guns and Roses.  Then it kinda started to veer REO Speedwagon-y.  Before I knew it I found myself at the end of a Youtube recommendation line: Bruce Hornsby.  I had never heard of this guy, but I know know those key strokes from Tupac's Changes.  After all I was a 1990 born 16 year old once.  At first the rat tail threw me off, but that melody rang so sweet my eyes saw no tail.  The next Youtube magic 8 ball pick was his second biggest hit: Madolin Rain.  It was my first time ever hearing this song.  Honestly I thought the song itself was fire.  It was one of those ones were it only takes one listen and your mashing the replay button.  

But..... The video is something else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDgOwX72fLI

Pretty much the band rocking out under a tent in the rain. Camera man was spinning in circles while sliding Barbra Walters filters over the lenses.  Plus the stare down by the drummer the end shoots daggers through your ass. But Hornsby has something about him.  A serious SWAGGER

Thats why I must know: As someone not born when this song came out. 
1. How was it received?  Was it lame?  It has close to 4 Million hits on YT
2.Was this anyone break up song at 15 to 18?
3. Do believe he played the accordian?
4. Where were they playing this at the time it came out?  Did it get Radio play?
5. Was this a chick song?

I am more or less curious about the 80's music scene and how things looked to the people listening at that time vs someone who didn't expedience it and is getting a glimpse back via 80's music Youtube

"So what the ""new wrinkle"" that Weir was so pumped about?","Remember the Rolling Stone interview in May when Bobby said the following?

""But this new wrinkle, which I'm not at liberty to try to attempt to describe because I really won't know what we're looking at until a few days into it at least ... that's what's got me going right now. The premise that we're working with is that when most people go to a show, they're not really watching what's going on onstage. They may be watching what's on the screen. But when the songs are playing in their mind's eye, they're actually watching a movie. They're watching the movie the song the character in the song is delivering. They're watching a movie on the big screen in their head. We're going to try to play to that.""

So, now that we are several shows into the tour, what exactly is he referencing? Is there something going on with the screens that was not happening last time around?

"My own ""Greatest Story"" - 27 yrs ago today @ Shoreline","I am cross-posting this after just writing it up for a separate thread. I hadn't thought about this magical night in years, but the memories came flooding back! Too delicious not to share with you peeps!

Today of the Dead: Shoreline Amphitheatre on 1990-06-16

I was there! I spent the afternoon selling t-shirts in the lot. And trying to score a ticket. While I sold a number of shirts (white rabbit ""feed your head"" psychedelic print), I had no such luck with a ticket. I did, however, meet a guy who was eager to trade party favors for a couple of shirts. Long story short, I was suddenly packing real opium. About 20 min before showtime, I met a buddy with a pass who was parked in the VIP lot. As we were chatting, a car pulled into said VIP area and I flung my miracle finger in the air. Four middle-aged women got out of the car, all wearing laminates. One of them smiled and gave me a pair of tickets for which she said she had no need. Naturally, I was gobsnacked and ecstatic. My other non-VIP friend had a lawn seat which she quickly miracled to some random head. And just like that, we were in! But wait - it gets better. The tickets were - I shit you not - 10th row center. DEAD center. The band struck up Let the Good Times Roll. As always, quite a propos! It didn't take long before I sparked a bowl with my newfound opium. And, as I mentioned earlier, it was legit. Heads turned at the scent. I turned on the woman next to me, who then opened up a Sucrets tin containing a single fresh mint leaf. She told me that it had been dipped in acid. Bombs away! Meanwhile, my pal, who was a Marin gal. had already been on the fence about even attending the show in the first place because the next day was Father's Day and she had a family brunch. But at that point, I just looked at her with the ""why stop now, this is clearly meant to be"" expression. I will never forget how easy it was to split that hit because I simply tore the lead down the middle vein. A glorious night memorialized in one of the View From the Vaults.

"Heads up driving into Boston, the train, free parking","Sup y'all, hope everyone is gonna have fun in the Bean!

I'm living here again so I wanna give a little forewarning-THE TALL SHIPS ARE COMING! THE TALL SHIPS ARE COMING! 

An event called Sail Boston is going down and traffic into, out, and in town is going to be horrendous. It's always bad coming in, but TBT, the past 2 weeks, for whatever reasons, have been the worst I have ever encountered. Coupled​ with Sail Boston, this is going to make for some serious fuckery. 

If you're coming from the south, RT 138 is meandering but might be groovier than 93/95 traffic and will take ya right into town. From the great North, RT 2 is always an option. 

If you choose to take 93/95, research MBTA green line stops on D train and commuter rail. It will take you right to Fenway. What's dope about this line is that it runs thru Brookline and Newton where free parking is available and no one will fuck with your rig. Brookline Hills T stop definitely has limited FREE wknd parking  at the high school and is 4 stops away from the show. Aside from this... Just check the MBTA green line D train. Even a Newton parking ticket is cheaper than paying the scumbag lot companies!

Can anyone give me the scoop on Wrigley?,"Some of you may have seen my posts going back and forth about doing the Wrigley shows. My wife basically demanded it after amazing boulder shows. It's a 15 hour drive from Colorado but she has family in the heart of Chicago and we would be a bike ride away from Wrigley. 

My biggest concern is sound. As I have to buy 4 tickets total, I really only want to buy the cheapies. How is the sound in the upper deck. I've seen Bobby, billy, Jeff and Mickey all perform in under 300 person venues. I don't care if I'm close but I do care about the sound. So where can I get the best sound for my buck?

Also, is t worth it to wait to buy tickets? Generally I would never drive 15 hrs without a ticket in hand but I've seen people say you can get like $10-$29 pavilion seats day of show (where is pavilion btw)

"Am I crazy? (Dead and Company, Burgettstown PA 6/15/17)","I was at the Burgettstown PA show.  Wonderful (despite the rain for some of it).  I won't go into all of my opinions about the show, but I need someone to tell me if I am crazy.  

I could have sworn that towards the end of one of the songs, the beat turned into a sort of calypso sounding thing, and Mayer was singing in a falsetto, and the song started to sound a lot like ""Stay"" by Jackson Brown.  I was blown away by what they had done to the song, and I actually turned to my wife and said that I thought they were going to start playing ""Stay"" by Jackson Brown.  I thought this happened at the end of He's Gone.  At the end of He's Gone Mayer does go a little falsetto, but I couldn't find him singing ""stay"" there, and the only song that has a sort of calypso beat was at the end of Throwing Stones.

Great show, but weird recollection.  So am I crazy, or does the following link with recordings of the show cut off some of the end of ""He's Gone""?

The beat turns into this sort of calypso sounding thing (at least that's how it sounds to me), and Mayer does in fact sing in a falsetto ""Oh won't you try, just a little bit harder"" in a way that sounds to me very reminiscent of Jackson Brown singing ""Oh won't you stay, just a little bit longer"".",gratefuldead,1497712663,medeadhead,7,8,True,2017-06-17

Total long shot - LOST at Burgettstown,"Total long shot here, and it's a sad story, my tour buddy and I went to the Starlake show (yea, it's always starlake) and bought concert posters. I also talked a friend of mine from arranging his summer trip in from Asia to coincide with this show, as it was his first show post Jerry. He's an old head, and actually was my babysitter as a child, anyway.... 

In the night, actually it was the first set, my tour buddy and I bought posters for the evening and my friend from Taiwan offered to hold them, of course we were going to change off, he went to the bathroom, and came back posterless, he searched and they were not found. The rest of the story is sad, but just wondering if anyone found then, you'd make my, and my tour buddy's day honestly. There is no fault here, shit happens, but I would LOVE if anyone found, that would be amazing.",gratefuldead,1497716959,erockvillage,7,5,True,2017-06-17

"John Perry Barlow's ""A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace""","As a result of his memorable role in the Amazon documentary, people have been discussing John Perry Barlow's many contributions to the Grateful Dead. 

In addition to being a stellar lyricist, and the co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Barlow also penned one of the most important political manifestos distributed during the early days of the Internet revolution. 

It begins like this: ""Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather."" 

Later, he writes: ""We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth"" and ""where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.""

---------------------------
Set Two Notes:

4:48 - See you folks in a bit.

5:12 - All quiet on the western front.

5:31 - Facebook says stream starts soon... whats your call for opener? Maybe a Shakedown?

5:35 - DANCING! WOOOOOOOOO!

5:36 - Johnna!

5:38 - Let Johnna wail! Also, Johnna channels some serious zen-master stuff on this song. I'm excited to see where this goes!

5:40 - This is good music. I must say again, if this isn't nice, then I don't know what is.

5:42 - Is Jeff wearing a wolf moon t-shirt? Did I see that correctly? Oteil also has a booty shake going on, but how do you not!?

5:44 - John fuckin' Slayer refuses to let this one go, and for good reason. Hot dog.

5:47 - bit of a hard stop on that Dancin', but wow. That was good.

5:49 - I really wanted that to be Shakedown Street... Bobby just said something into the mic again, someone on sound is fucking up!

5:52 - Anyone ever imagine what Bobby would look like if he shaved everything off and went totally bald?

5:55 - Really loving those chord runs John is doing... jeez. That's good.

5:56 - I'm resisting the urge to bold the whole second set, I guess I either have low standards or they are cookin' hot again.

5:58 - what in the great blue fuck is going on here? Sweet lord have mercy. We have achieved some real melt here.

6:00 - Mickey found a cowbell on the way over, and well, here we are.

6:03 - Oteil making sweet love to his bass on stage and taking it for a walk.

6:12 - Bobby Barker.

6:14 - this band has been so hot during Eyes of the World this tour. Excited to hear where this goes.

6:17 - Bobby's guitar is tuned to its own tuning. Unfortunately, nobody else is tuned to Bobby...

6:20 - Does John have Playboy picks?....

6:22 - I hate to be a downer, but this Eyes is totally getting goofed up due to the Bob-flat tuning we got.

6:24 - Any guesses as to what that pink liquid in the bottle Billy has got next to his drumset is?

6:25 - Sometimes the tunings that we play in are tunings of our own.

6:26 - Oteil and Billy making sweet love on that low end.

6:35 - This is a really great Drums, not gonna lie. Usually don't dig it too much.

6:37 - Mickey taking a duck horn solo.

6:46 - oooooh... an in-tune Eyes of the World now?

6:49 - I'm digging the fuck out of what's going on right now, except for the dropped stream.

6:51 - Right back into this dirty blues... Bobby sounding great too. Someone taught him how to play Slide.

6:54 - /u/lennonmacca has it right - this is SLUDGY!

6:58 - I like Bobby on this one, but I think John holds court with it better...

7:00 - Gotta say, other than the unique tuning bobby used on Eyes, this has been a stellar show. Glad to be hear with you folks. 

7:04 - Even if I like JM better on this one, Bobby definitely earned the rights to sing this one.

7:05 - Lets get this Franklins going! Love this one. 

7:09 - I love the wide shots Nugs is doing during this show. 

7:16 - Hoooooo donkey. That was a good'n. Love the false ending, too.

7:19 - John fucking slays this song. Made me feel lots of things at Shoreline with it. 

7:27 - Did you guys honestly think this wasn't gonna happen?

7:33 - Thanks everyone! that was a heater! always wanted to host, glad I got to try it out! See ya'll down the road!!!",gratefuldead,1497739433,[deleted],564,87,True,2017-06-17

I think it's a mix of him singing more within his range, ""growing into his voice"" so-to-speak, and the fact he has a better vocal supporting cast than he used to have.

Home recorded cover of West LA,"Hey heads
Just a disclaimer, I post here pretty regularly, not an intruder, but if putting this here is not welcome I won't do it again :-)

I've been recording at home and writing for a couple years now under the name Crystal Maverick Band (just me though at least for right now). I thought I'd share my cover of West La Fadeaway, since this is where the heads are at and if I only share on my social media it might not get to any real fans of the music, and for better or worse I think I'd like it to. So yeah, if you want to delve deeper all the rest of the stuff on my SoundCloud is my own and I record all the instruments (except the drums I program) and sing

Because of him, I was lucky enough to see 15 dead shows. (10 or so I can remember).  I lost my dad to a fluke of an illness a couple years back, he was 56. I have a seven year old boy, and I take him to all the shows I go to. He loves good ol' Grateful Dead. In the car today he asked if I could change the Bertha we were listening to to a ""74 version"" because he preferred that year. I cried a bit at that. I guess the point of this story is to say happy father's day to all of you wonderful dads. Because I know that without mine, Bertha 74 would never have been a request from my 7 year old, and that's a beautiful thing. ",gratefuldead,1497835467,xthedaysbetweenx,5,56,True,2017-06-18

New Deadhead hitting his first show,"I'm 21 years old and grew up always hearing random Dead songs around the house but I just recently REALLY saw the light and realized what an absolutely life changing band this is. Got into them a few months ago around the time my mom was really sick (she's recovering thankfully.) Listening to GD around that time really helped me focus on being happy and at this point I would consider myself a deadhead. 

With all of that being said, I got tickets for me and my Father to go see Dead and Company next Sunday in Camden. My old man has seen the Dead multiple times in the 80's so he's really excited to go.

"What is your ""definitely best version"" of a particular song?","Now obviously there is no right or wrong answer. But which Dead jam of a certain song, when you hear it, makes you think ""This is *the one*""?

For me, the best version of Sugaree comes from 5/19/1977, on Dick's Picks 29. A 16-minute, absolutely transcendent Jerry jam. Keith kills, too! It jams into a fantastic El Paso if you're up for letting it ride.

Best Dead shows w/ Pigpen,"So I'm a diehard headie even though I was born after Jerry's death. I've seen Furthur, the Fare Thee We'll tour, Dead and Co. And Dark Star Orchestra. I love the Dead, they're the greatest band ever, and there's no one like them! 

But I only really listen to 1977 and on shows. I love Keith on keys and think the band flows almost flawlessly all the time. And Donna's voice makes the Grateful Dead sound great she's amazing. And Brent plays keys terrifically, his voiced took the band to some great places, and his overall energy made the band sync up really well on a different way. 

So now I feel like I need to listen to earlier shoes with Pigpen because my Dad (who got me into the Dead as a kid) has recently got into Pigpen on keys. But it's so hard to find good quality shows from that early on. 

So can yall put together a solid list of the best shows  from when Pigpen was alive, I need to get into him!",gratefuldead,1494593270,jpetey97,29,10,True,2017-05-12

Suggestions for the next box set?,"As many of us are undoubtedly devouring the new May '77 box, I would like to know what eras or runs you feel would make the best/likeliest/most interesting candidates for the *next* box release. As for myself...

Although the set lists are fairly repetitive, what about a May '70 acoustic sets-only grouping? The '80 sets were IMO thoroughly covered by *Reckoning* (especially with the 2nd disc in the '04 update), and at least a couple of the complete May '70 shows have already been released via Dicks Picks and Road Trips. But I've always loved these wonderfully relaxed (and often hilarious banter-wise) acoustic sets played at the beginning of the *Workingman's* /*American Beauty* era. There's a great essay covering early acoustic live Dead here:  [http://deadessays.blogspot.com/2009/08/deads-acoustic-sets-1969-1970.html?m=1](http://)

I know that most shows are already in circulation, but aside from the above suggestion, I could also be arm-twisted into picking up (and in no particular order):

- Greek Theater summer '84
- Fall '90, Europe or MSG
- Anchorage, AK summer '80
- summer '73 (perhaps with ABB 12/31 3rd set included)
- June '76
- fall/winter '79

Go ahead and ask at your next show. It'll start a very friendly, if somewhat confused, argument about what we are chanting. You'll realize everyone does something slightly different.

Thank you r/gratefuldead,"Hey guys, I just want to thank this subreddit for introducing me to music that has done wonders for my life. 

I started graduate school this past August and was feeling overwhelmed with all the stuff going on around me. The combination of schoolwork, living in a new city, and handling work was sort of driving me crazy. I eventually started turning to reddit to decompress for the few moments I had. 

Well, I fell upon this subreddit around September without putting too much thought into it, but later on I was really starting to enjoy the posts and wanted to know more behind the music. I started habitually visiting here and absorbing hours of grateful dead music on youtube/archive.org to see what everything was about. I also visited a few stores in my former college town that my friends mentioned to me that were owned by deadheads. The people who owned those places were always super helpful to me and seemed to be very down to earth people. This really had an impression on me and I decided to fully immerse myself with the music and the meanings behind the lyrics. 

Around the end of December I found myself listening to GD music for hours, often staying up until 6am listening to studio and live versions in iTunes. Although I had limited funds, I ended up buying a ton of tracks and found the archive.org site and listened to those songs everyday for 5 months straight. I even started skipping songs I used to like in search for the juicy GD tracks. I expected myself to start getting tired of the songs in a few months, but surprisingly I actually appreciate the music more now that I did before.  Because of the amazing individuals in this reddit and the music you showed me, I can honestly say that my outlook on life has improved significantly and I've become more positive towards others in my life. I just want to say a quick thank you for letting me join along the ride and show a 20-something the magic of the Grateful dead.

I look forward to a long life spreading the joy that this music brings.

Anyone happen to save the cover art WMVW/quinfolk made from Dead&Co 2016 shows?,"hey there.  anyone happen to save/download the nice artwork WMVW/quinfolk made for the Dead & Co shows they had on soundcloud?

Not ""drug"" checkpoints, but it's pretty obvious what they're after. However, I read Yelp reviews of USANA and other reviews in the Salt Lake Tribune, people were complaining that the ""ticketholders"" weren't getting what they payed for because the security doesn't crack down on marijuana use inside the venue.

5/26/73 China>Rider and other thoughts,"Wow this just totally stole my face a second ago. The sound mix is absolutely perfect, with Jerry in the right channel and Bobby in the left. Bobby especially can be heard very clearly. This is not your usual China>Rider transition from 73. Some of the transitions like 10/19/73 are sort of relaxed and languid. This one hits at full speed and Bob resorts to playing short and quick chords almost like a Tighten Up jam as opposed to the longer, more spaced out typical Feelin' Groovy  chords. 

I don't know how people can listen to the rich beautiful tone Bob's guitar had in 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 and then listen to his playing from today. I personally think his playing is hardly even professional anymore. His poor playing is the real reason Dead and Company plays so slowly. Anyone seen that video on YouTube where he totally freaks out because John Mayer starts a song he wasn't expecting? He can't even go with the flow of the music anymore without his iPad telling him what to do. I would literally rather see a Mayer, Burbridge, Kreutzman Trio any day over Dead and Co. 

I can honestly see where Chris Robinson is coming from in his recent comments. But the worst offenders by far of ""sucking off of the Grateful Dead nipple"" are Dead and Co and Bob Weir himself! It makes me cringe when I read that he wants Dead and Co to pick up where they left off in 95. Giving Dead and Co too much credit only serves to discredit the magic that The Grateful Dead created on stage. Listen to that China>Rider from 5/26/73 and tell me that Dead and Co could do anything remotely as spontaneous and beautiful. 

I'm not trying to shit on Bob Weir or John Mayer or Dead and Company but I wish some people would reevaluate their thoughts about this. Dead and Co isn't even close to the real thing. I would rather see more effort and attention being put towards finding lost tapes, restoring those of poor sound quality, and spreading the inspired music of the Grateful Dead. Who in the world would want the Dead's legacy to be a bunch of drugged out hippies that was then resurrected by mainstream, materialistic Mayer? Dead and Co for me are the opposite of what the Grateful Dead were. Jerry was the quiet leader of the band who very willing traded off songs with other band members. Bobby yells at people onstage and has predetermined the set lists. Not only are the set lists predetermined but so is the playing. There isn't the same improvisatory nature in Dead and Co as with the Grateful Dead. 

With that being said, I'll be heading to my third Dead and Co show this summer in Ohio. But, I will not be talking about how the torch is being passed to Mayer or comparing the experience to the true Grateful Dead experience. I will be, however, continuing to crank my headphones and meditate to the sweet sound of The Grateful Dead. ",gratefuldead,1495026132,BeatDropFeetFlop,37,7,True,2017-05-17

Late criticism of John Mayer by Chris Robinson.,"I have read the ridiculous stuff Robinson has said. My response is simply this: I saw Dead and Company last year for the first time. I was skeptical, to say the least. When they came out on stage, Mayer was chicken-heading (if that's even a thing) from the start. You don't do that unless you are into the music. You can get up on stage and fake all kinds of shit, but you can't fake an 8 minute guitar solo (or can you?). There HAS to be some emotion there. If the remaining band has accepted him (Mickey, Bill, Bobby) then I accept him. Haters gonna hate? The Grateful Dead has never been the same group of guys or (gal). Ever. Yes, Jerry was what we all considered to be the heart of the band, but Jerry said that Pigpen was the heart of the band. It's different from year to year, from concert to concert. I'm just happy to be along for the ride.

GD music spreads a message of love and acceptance, and I think we need to embrace that message right now. Yeah CR might have said some mean things towards somebody that many of us including myself have a lot of respect for, but that's no reason to continually bash on the guy and prod at him like butthurt children. If you don't like him, ignore him and go about your business, there is no sense in spreading hate through this awesome sub.

Comes a Time 5/9/77,"I've always loved this song - it's one of Hinter's simplest and most straightforward lyrics, and they played it infrequently enough that hearing it is always a pleasant surprise. And the version on the last disc of the new '77 box is fucking amazing. Jerry's solo out of the last verse is long and heartbreaking. They stay with the melancholy chords of the last part of the chorus for several bars, and then slide seamlessly into the slightly more hopeful major chords that end the song, continuing long enough to restore some slight hope that just maybe, I will indeed see that it's not too late to fill my cup.

"""born in the wrong generation"" [rant]","there's nothing i've ever found more annoying and pitiful than the angsty kids who think they're special for saying ""ugh i was born in the wrong generation!""

 

but as a 21 year old who fell in love with the dead a couple years ago...  i hate myself to say it, but dammit i think i was born in the wrong generation! (**self hatred intensifies**)

 

but seriously...if i wanna do something similar to following the dead around these days, it's dead and company.  which is awesome for many many reasons (one being that mayer has ""tricked"" a lot of my peers into hoppin on the bus).  but for equally many reasons...**it just ain't the same, man!**  the sociopolitical climate, the ticket prices, the culture.  

 

and i know it's not *supposed* to be the same.  i realize it's silly to pretend the year is anything other than 2017.  i also realize that the dead were always counterculture and not mainstream, so comparing them to say the chainsmokers is just illogical.

 

but i guess what i'm trying to whine about is that i'm tired of feeling so damn out-of-place as a ""deadhead"" in 2017 (forgive me if you feel i'm misappropriating the term).  it's not just that the modern jam scene is on the fringe, and largely 40+ year olds, but also i have a hard time grooving to say umph and discuits like i can with the dead.  the very notion of a ""jam band"" seems to be a group that attempts, usually with a degree of failure, to emulate what the grateful dead did.

 

can anyone else sympathize with me?  am i just another whiney kid who doesn't fit into his generation?  i suppose my real wish is that the modern dead/jam scene can crawl out of the fringe into the size and quality of what it once was.  but i suppose that might be hoping for a bit much

  

**edit: i realize, along with the rant, that i totally lost sight of the main main point i really wanted to make, which is the younger generation's general failure to embrace jam.  ""heads"" are and always have been a minority, but this is so to a very depressing degree in my generation.**",gratefuldead,1495490332,hankkush,37,9,True,2017-05-22

Re: Last Night in Manchester - The Music Never Stops,"It broke my heart to hear of the attack last night in Manchester.  Live music is where so many of us go to when we want an escape from the problems of the world.  Every walk of life and every genre, from Ariana Grande to Metallica, Garth Brooks and Toby Keith to Kendrick Lamar and the Pixies – Festivals across the world, big and small, from Coachella and Jazz Fest to local county fairs and pop up shows in parks.  The Little Monsters, Deadheads, Parrotheads, Beliebers, Swifities and Fanilows – The Kiss Army, Juggalos, Phans, Claymates, Sinners, and the original Beatlemaniacs – the Warehouse, the Big Parade, the Zamily and the Beyhive.  From cover bands in smoky bars to legends performing in Madison Square Garden, we all share that common bond of singing along and dancing until our bones hurt.  Don’t let this keep you from doing what we love most – go out more, see some bands you never thought of seeing, shake a stranger’s hand and tell them how much fun you’re having.  Remembers those who were lost, honor their memory at your next show and don’t take a minute of your experience for granted.  The music never stops.

1987 es muy bueno,"'87 strikes me as a particularly tight and energetic year, the beginning of the late-stage Renaissance that ended not long after Brent's tragic and untimely death. I imagine there were more rehearsals coming back from Jerry's coma/recovery in the fall of '86 than they'd bothered with for a long time, and it comes through in the shows. I'm sure this also affected the energy level that is present in even the short and often-played numbers, like ""Loser"" and ""Big RR Blues"" and Bobby's Dylan covers. I'm digging 4/11/87 right now - it's been a little while since I visited 1987 and it's usually good stuff. ",gratefuldead,1495652781,tf72,4,6,True,2017-05-24

As soon as I walk in to the empty shop, the fella manning the counter yells ""Hey man, I *LOVE* your shirt!""

I couldn't help but smile as soon as I saw him; this dude was the epitome of stereotypical Deadhead: dreads, a warm smile, a friendly demeanor, and clearly baked. I knew I was in for a good conversation.

So we get talking, about our favorite show, how we think that Donna is both under-appreciated and misunderstood (unpopular), and our favorite Pigpen songs, when suddenly he asks:

""What's your favorite Jerry, man?""

I was a bit confused at the question and asked what he meant.

He clarified: ""What's your favorite Jerry, man? Like LSD Jerry, Cocaine Jerry, Sober Jerry, or Heroin Jerry?""

It was crass, but I couldn't help but laugh because I knew *exactly* what he meant.

For the record, I answered LSD - Sober - Cocaine - Heroin Jerry, in that order. Though it was hard to choose.

Anyway, what's your guys' favorite Jerry? :-)

Best bet for getting some pit tickets for 6/15?,"Sup peeps, 

Im trying to get me and 2 other friends some pit tickets for Burgettstown but I just cant seem to find more than 1 for sale anywhere. Havent ever been close to the stage so Id really like to get in there because Im unfortunately not going to probably catch more than 1 or 2 shows this summer. 

What channels should I keep an eye on? Ive been checking cashortrade but the tickets get scooped up pretty quickly on there. Been looking on stubhub too.  

Also, anyone familiar with that venue? I went there last year but I was on the lawn. Are you free to kinda wander around in your section under the pavilion or are you kinda restricted to your seat?   

Its looking like I wont be able to find pit tickets so Ill probably have to get some for the section behind the pit. Id almost be willing to find tickets in the lot on the day of the show but Id rather have a good time before the show than running around trying to find some tickets.  

Any thoughts? ",gratefuldead,1495837951,TruckInn,7,3,True,2017-05-26

TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE DEADCO,"This is my first post. I started reading this post about 3 months before the Fare Thee Well shows and have greatly enjoyed it, especially all the new young heads just discovering the music and getting so excited when they find out the depth and breadth of the catalogue, so hello to all my fellow Heads young and old!

I was originally going to write this post on Christmas eve last year, but I got sick about 3 days before and had to abandon my idea. So I've decided to write it tonight before the start of DeadCo tour. This Deadafied version of this old Christmas tale was given to me by a fellow head about 20 years ago who lived here in Colorado, and has since moved away. I have slightly rewritten it to make proper for the current line up. So I hope you enjoy this as you embark on tour this summer. It's incredible time's that we still have 4 members of the band still out there getting it done on so many nights. We should all be nothing but grateful that we still have them around, and enjoy every moment as it will soon be in our past. Please everyone have a safe and awesome tour this year and don't forget to smile smile smile!

Twas the night before DeadCo, and all through the town,
Not a ticket could be purchased, not a mushroom could be found;
The tie-dies were hung by the tape deck with care,
In hopes that the party would soon there;
House guests were nestled all snug in their bags,
With psychedelic dreams of all night dancing jags;
When out in the street there arose such a noise,
I sprang from my bed to see if it was the boys.

Away to the window I swam like a bass,
Tore open the curtains and fell through the glass;
The lights on the crust of the strips' all aglow,
Gave Vegas the lustre of a nuclear snow;
When what to my flash blind eye's should appear,
But an electric Kool-Aid bus, all loaded with gear;
With a mop head driver all spaced out and hairy,
I knew in a moment that it must be young Johnny!

More rapid than eagles, his followers they came,
They whistled, and shouted, and called out by name;
""Play Trucking, play Terrapin, play Shakedown, play Mars!'
They came by the planeload, by foot and in cars;
They filled up the sidewalk, and soon blocked the street,
They came by the thousands. most were named Pete;
All round my house, the number of Dead heads they grew,
So I pumped up the boom box, and served chex mix too!

And then, in an instant, I heard from the bus,
The banging and clanging of a mass exodus;
As I drew up my head and was turning around,
Out the bus door came Johnny, in a transplendent bound;
He was dressed all in checkers, quite simply extreme,
His clothes they were encrusted with pralines and cream;
A brand new guitar was flung on his back,
He looked like your average, young rock music hack. 

His eyes how they sparkled, all bloodshot with merry,
His cheeks were so rosey, we nicknamed him cherry;
As he grabbed his guitar and drew it up like a gift,
The air grew thinner, and we started to shift;
When he began to play, deftly moving his hands,
Everyone around me, fell into a trance;
Then all of sudden, something went bing,
and I too was doing the Go-Johnny-Swing!

I swung on my Venus and danced in my head,
Feeling so GRATEFUL, I had nothing to dread;
When Johnny played solo, it lasted an hour,
But I don't remember, I was rappin' with a flower;
Then the band stopped playing, as quick as they started,
They hopped on a bus and graciously departed;
But I heard them all chant, as past me they all hurled,
"" Wake Up To Find Out That You Are The Eye's Of the World""

Give me your best GD line that you think might fit at the end of this tale!
Have fun everyone! See you in Boulder! Yogi

I'm going to the Atlanta Dead and Co show. Who all is going? See you on Shakedown. I, also, am a woodburner that also tie dyes my pieces using a technique called wooden aquarelle.

I'm thinking of starting a little dye company, PM if there is any interest in my dyes or art.

Dupree's Diamond Blues Lyrics,"When I was just a little young boy,
Papa said ""Son, you'll never get far,
I'll tell you the reason if you want to know,
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go""

Well baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well when I get those jelly roll blues
Why I'd go and get anything in this world for you.

Down to the jewelry store packing a gun,
Says ""Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one""
""A thousand dollars please, "" the jewelry man said
Dupree he said, ""I'll pay this one off to you in lead""

Well you know son you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad -
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

Judge said ""Son, this gonna cost you some time""
Dupree said ""Judge, you know that crossed my mind""
Judge said ""Fact it's gonna cost you your life""
Dupree said ""Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right""

Well baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man
Dupree come out with a losing hand
Baby's gonna weep it up for awhile
Then go on out and find another sweet man's
Gonna treat her with style

Judge said ""Son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret I can't never tell""
Dupree said ""Judge, well it's well understood,
And you got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good""

Well you know son you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad,
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

Same old story and I know it's been told,
Some like jelly jelly - some like gold
Many a man's done a terrible thing
Just to get baby that shiny diamond ring",gratefuldead,1491969194,HeadyVersion,1,1,True,2017-04-11

Close first round match up with Slipknot barely ""slipping by"" against Greatest Story Ever Told. This next round is going to be awesome! Thank you all for your support! Now, lets get those votes in!



______________________________________________________________________________________





Overview:
I know, I know, its not March Madness anymore. Regardless, my co-workers thought it would be fun if we had a little Grateful Dead March Madness style bracket for your favorite GD song ever. What song makes you weep, what song makes you dance, and ultimately, what song makes you get up out of your chair and sing.



Couple things: 

* 1) There are soooo many great Dead songs, this is not meant for an argument, we had to make some cuts to get to 68 teams (songs)
* 2) The seeds have been selected by my co-workers to keep the bracket match ups fair. 
* 3) I will break this down in multiple rounds with multiple surveys.
* 4) We chose to keep each songs individual (ie China Cat Sunflower and I know your Rider are 2 songs rather than *China Rider* )
* 5) Each round will consist be a few days long and I will update the above bracket. Please dont vote twice :)
* 6) This is meant to be fun

My family's weird little connection to The Dead,"When I was in high school, my Uncle Bill took me on a genealogy trip all over the southern midwest to visit family gravesites he'd found during his years of research. While we drove, he told me stories about the family, including this one about his cousin (my ""great uncle"") John, who lived next to the Garcias in Stinson Beach in the 70's.

""One time I called John up out in Stinson Beach, and this before we had answering machines, so if he wasn't there to pick it up, it would just ring and ring and ring. But sometimes he was just busy or couldn't hear the phone so I'd wait. So this time I called him, it rang and rang and rang, must have been 30 or 40 times. And I was just about to hang up when John finally picks up the phone, panting, you know, all out of breath. And I say, 'John, what's going on? Are you alright?' And he says, 'Oh I'm great! I was just out back with Jerry and Mountain Girl, dancing around naked in the garden to help the pot plants grow.'

He was talking about Jerry Garcia! He lived next door to them in Stinson Beach for a while. He said they liked it because there were no local cops, and there was just this one long road into San Francisco, so if the cops were coming you could see their lights about a half an hour before they got there.""

A little while ago I came across [this article](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/23/grateful-dead-icon-jerry-garcias-former-stinson-beach-home-up-for-sale/) about the Stinson Beach house, and in it, Mountain Girl says, ""It was the most beautiful place, just as nice as it possibly could be. I grew pot in the garden out in back. It was a lovely place. It was just heaven."" So that made the whole thing a little more real to me.

Overview:
I know, I know, its not March Madness anymore. Regardless, my co-workers thought it would be fun if we had a little Grateful Dead March Madness style bracket for your favorite GD song ever. What song makes you weep, what song makes you dance, and ultimately, what song makes you get up out of your chair and sing.



Couple things: 

* 1) There are soooo many great Dead songs, this is not meant for an argument, we had to make some cuts to get to 68 teams (songs)
* 2) The seeds have been selected by my co-workers to keep the bracket match ups fair. 
* 3) I will break this down in multiple rounds with multiple surveys.
* 4) We chose to keep each songs individual (ie China Cat Sunflower and I know your Rider are 2 songs rather than *China Rider* )
* 5) Each round will consist be a few days long and I will update the above bracket. Please dont vote twice :)
* 6) This is meant to be fun

and there were days

Summer flies and August dies
the world grows dark and mean
Comes the shimmer of the moon
on black infested trees

the holy on their knees
the reckless are out wrecking
the timid plead their pleas
No one knows much more of this
than anyone can see anyone can see
There were days
and there were days
and there were days besides
when phantom ships with phantom sails 
set to sea on phantom tides
Comes the lightning of the sun
on bright unfocused eyes
the blue of yet another day
a springtime wet with sighs
a hopeful candle lingers
in the land of lullabies
where headless horsemen vanish
with wild and lonely cries lonely cries
There were days
and there were days
and there were days I know
when all we ever wanted
was to learn and love and grow
Once we grew into our shoes
we told them where to go
walked halfway around the world
on promise of the glow
stood upon a mountain top
walked barefoot in the snow
gave the best we had to give
how much we'll never know we'll never know
There were days
and there were days
and there were days between
polished like a golden bowl
the finest ever seen
Hearts of Summer held in trust
still tender, young and green
left on shelves collecting dust
not knowing what they mean
valentines of flesh and blood
as soft as velveteen
hoping love would not forsake

Keys/Scales/Modes/General Theory of Dead Songs For Dummies,"Okay first and foremost I'll admit this thread is mainly for selfish purposes. I want to know these damn songs. BUT, I believe this could be very beneficial for everyone in here, especially for beginners/dummies like me. 

The main idea behind this thread stems from this [messageboard](http://community.rukind.com/viewtopic.php?f=333&t=674) I stumbled upon, and perhaps we (and by ""we"" I of course mean those of you who know things) could build on it. It's over 10 years old now and appears to be mostly ""dead"" (ha!) or else I'd just jump in there.

A lot of the answers I'm looking for are in there, but as you guys might have found when you were learning, with every answer I find there seems to be 10 more questions spawned. Also, a lot of these questions can be answered via google, but it all gets so confusing before I know it I've got 10 tabs open and gone down a rabbit whole on what the hell an Ionian mode is that I've forgotten what song I was trying to learn in the first place! It's like the damn Davinci Code!!

Just look at the thread I linked to. Someone says TLEO is in C...next post ""well actually.... it's in G with a C Ionian scale.."" then the next post ""Well actually it's with G Mixolydian"" (which I'm not sure means it's in the key of C using G as the tonal center or if it's in G using D as the tonal center...like I said with every answer there's more questions) then the next guy will say ""actually it bounces back and forth between this and that mode"" etc etc

As you can see, to a beginner this can all be quite overwhelming. I've got pretty basic fundamental understandings of major scales, blues, I IV V, major pentatonic, all that jazz (wait, no! Not jazz!). Mixolydian is becoming clearer to me, at least when it comes to Sugaree (although somewhere in there someone says not to stay on mixo...huh? You can change modes?), but as soon as someone starts goin on about ionian, dorian, aeolian, chromatic, minor pentatonic, aries, scorpio, lions, tigers, bears, oh my! I start getting a damn headache and it all gets convoluted. 


ANYWAY back to the original idea of this thread. A place for people to ask questions regarding Keys of songs and suggested scales/modes from those in the know, and maybe explain a bit of theory behind it as a reference for beginners. I'm aware that a certain amount of experimentation is required/recommended, and of course searching out and finding answers is all a necessary part of the process and all that, but most of the time I don't even know what to experiment with, and it would still be good to have something to fall back to.

I'll start with the two songs referenced above. Sugaree and/or TLEO, what gives?


Edit: I should probably note I'm comin at this stuff as a beginner piano/keyboard player, if that makes any difference at all.",gratefuldead,1492440997,pattyice11,27,22,True,2017-04-17

At the end of Johnny B. Goode there are 3 songs from a Jerry Garcia Band show. I was completely blown away by these three renditions of Tore Up Over You, They Love Each Other, and That's What Love Will Make You Do. The recording is very crisp with Jerry and the piano cranked up in the mix. The bass is subtle so I can't tell whose playing it is. The drums are also quite low in the mix but Jerry's playing is so crisp and clear. I have tried searching through Jerry Band set lists to find shows with these three songs but I have yet to find the same sound from my cassette. They Love Each Other is so good- maybe better than any Dead recording I've heard. The beginning is great. Jerry starts it out as usual, dun dun, dun dun, dun dun and then whoever the pianist is joins him emphatically on the rest of the riff dun dun dun. It would be awesome if any of my rambling jogged someone's memory and they knew what date these three songs could possibly be from.

"Essay on ""Thats it for the Other One"", let me know what you think! (dont review it, just read it to see if you agree!. This should be for fun!)","Picking a favorite song is much harder than one would think. When I started thinking about it, a favorite song should in a way provoke strong emotions to the listener. I would say that my favorite song is “That’s It for the Other One” by the Grateful Dead. This song evokes quite a few different emotions within a single song and is never the same when played live. Coming in anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes long, it has the potential to make the listener feel a different way every time.
 In class we talked about how a song can be broken up into sections, with the song then a jam and coming back to the song again. Technically, the song is broken up into two songs. Written out on setlists as Cryptical Envelopment >The Other One> Cryptical Envelopment, in which cryptical is used to set the mood in the beginning and bring the listener back from the jam in the end. I believe that this song is the epitome of sending the listener out into space, and bringing them back again once it gets too weird. 
After Cryptical is played, generally the Grateful Dead drummers start doing their thing. In my opinion a good version has a strong drum solo section before the other band members join in. This to me sets the mood for the strong string intro that the song has. The drum section of the song is a true embodiment to the notion that the Grateful Dead are something you need to experience live. At a live show, in the right “mind set”, the drums can transport you out of the show, all the while building anticipation until the bass finally comes in and the rest of the band joins making you feel like the song is literally exploding! This is my favorite moment in music, a moment where the mixture of both precision and chaos are blended together.
Once the song “explodes”, Jerry Garcia’s lead guitar comes shining through the madness. The rhythm guitar setting the stage for a piercing section of jerry licks. This section takes the listener and forces the person to listen intently on all that is happening. Jerry commands one's attention in the way that the solo is played, to the point where you feel on the edge of your seat, even if you're dancing… Eventually the section slows down, to where the jam takes you away. The band falls into a symbiotic relationship in which Jerry is no longer the leader, the entire band is promoting the direction that they take. This is ended once the band comes back into the original rhythm of the song.
After a period of time the Bob Weir sings: 
	“Spanish lady come to me she lays on me this rose
	 It rainbows spirals around and round, trembles then explodes
	 Left a smoking crater on my mind i'd like it blown away
	 But the heat come round and busted me for smilin on a cloudy day”
To me, these lyrics don't me much other than a reprieve from the madness that had ensued within the music before this point. The instrumental section after this verse is much more mellow than the first, following a standard progression with a defined peak. But are the dead ever that straightforward? This section can be as simple or complex as the band permits, on any given night.  From here the band comes back into the rhythm of the song, and after a period of time  Bob Weir sings the lyrics:
	“Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
	 It trembled and exploded left a bus stop in its place
	 The bus came  by and i got on that when it all began
	 There was cowboy neal at the wheel and the bus to never ever land”
Without time to even process what just happened, you are thrust back into the song Cryptical Envelopment. I truly believe this song was added onto The Other One to bring a sort of perspective to an otherwise chaotic song. The First line being:
	 “ The other day it ended
	 With rainbow colors blended
	 His mind remained unbended, he had to die”
Once again, not sure what to think of the lyrics other than the soothing emotion Jerry’s voice brings. This brings the listener back into reality, with a mix of soothing vocals and mellow instrumentals. After the phrase “you know he had to die” has been repeated over and over, more intense every time, the instrumentals gain more steam. Until finally the instrumentals take over and intensely bring the listener to the end of the song. 
I think that the average concert goer is missing out if a band isn't willing to venture out of their comfort zone. I have seen many different jam bands, that on any given night will go out on a limb to present the listener with a “gem” of a version of a great song. Even after this, I can't say that any of those songs compare to “That's it for the Other One” by the Grateful Dead.",gratefuldead,1492498041,gratefulstudent12,5,7,True,2017-04-18

Overview:
I know, I know, its not March Madness anymore. Regardless, my co-workers thought it would be fun if we had a little Grateful Dead March Madness style bracket for your favorite GD song ever. What song makes you weep, what song makes you dance, and ultimately, what song makes you get up out of your chair and sing.



Couple things: 

* 1) There are soooo many great Dead songs, this is not meant for an argument, we had to make some cuts to get to 68 teams (songs)
* 2) The seeds have been selected by my co-workers to keep the bracket match ups fair. 
* 3) I will break this down in multiple rounds with multiple surveys.
* 4) We chose to keep each songs individual (ie China Cat Sunflower and I know your Rider are 2 songs rather than *China Rider* )
* 5) Each round will consist be a few days long and I will update the above bracket. Please dont vote twice :)
* 6) This is meant to be fun

Blue Sky and similarities between the styles of Dickey Betts and Bobby/Jerry [Discussion?],"Hey folks,

So, I've been listening to the Allman Brothers for a long time now but I've recently been diving into the Dickey Betts, Warren Haynes, and Allen Woody era, specifically 1992. Seriously, they were TIGHT during this period.

Anyways, I have always thought Dickey had a similar rhythm style to Bobby, even listening as far back as the Fillmore 71 shows, but it is very apparent to me when I listen to versions of Blue Sky from the 90s. For example, check out [this one off of ""An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band, First Set""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVhgf1GgBCg). 

When Warren is soloing, Dickey's rhythm sounds very much like Bobby, especially starting around 3:25 (compare with Bobby's rhythm on [this Franklin's Tower from 11-02-79](https://youtu.be/T1ZbQTq2SyI?t=660)). It just has the same bounce to it with the same style of improvisation.

And when Dickey solos in this version, it sounds like he is taking inspiration from Jerry. Maybe playing the same kinds of scales?

Gregg Allman said that when they were recording Eat a Peach, a bunch of them (Dickey, Oakley, and Butch) were obsessing over American Beauty. I've always thought Blue Sky was a very ""Dead"" song and shared the same themes with Sugar Magnolia. Anyone think Blue Sky could have been Dickey's tribute to the Dead?

Just got back from the Grateful Dead Movie 4/20 screening,"Just got home. Really fun night. I'm curious if everyone else's theaters showed some of the same pre-movie things. There was a mini-documentary about some heads who went to the 77 Cornell show, but afterwards they showed video of Dead and Company doing an acoustic version of Ripple (from last summer, not sure of date and venue) Best of all, they showed us a few minutes from the upcoming Long Strange Trip documentary. 
I've seen the GDM probably a hundred times but this was my first time seeing it on the big screen. Looked and sounded fantastic. Lots of things I don't really think I noticed before - Ned Lagin with his synths behind Jerry during ""Morning Dew"", Phil's airbrushed bird t-shirt, Jeff Levy - who is doing electrical work at Bobby's house and gets into the show backstage - is seen later with his shirt wide open looking dosed as fuck.

And Jerry just seems to have a tenacity about him in NFA right down to a near perfect hand off heading into going down the road.

Overview:
I know, I know, its not March Madness anymore. Regardless, my co-workers thought it would be fun if we had a little Grateful Dead March Madness style bracket for your favorite GD song ever. What song makes you weep, what song makes you dance, and ultimately, what song makes you get up out of your chair and sing.



Couple things: 

* 1) There are soooo many great Dead songs, this is not meant for an argument, we had to make some cuts to get to 68 teams (songs)
* 2) The seeds have been selected by my co-workers to keep the bracket match ups fair. 
* 3) I will break this down in multiple rounds with multiple surveys.
* 4) We chose to keep each songs individual (ie China Cat Sunflower and I know your Rider are 2 songs rather than *China Rider* )
* 5) Each round will consist be a few days long and I will update the above bracket. Please dont vote twice :)
* 6) This is meant to be fun

Dark Star is out! Franklins is out! We are down to the finals! Scarlet vs Eyes, both 3 seeds made it! I really am looking forward to everyones responses. This has been a blast for me! Personally, there is no better 1-2 combo when it comes to Scarlet --> Fire (even though this shouldnt sway your vote as we are doing individual songs only), but at the same time, there is no better song to drink a beer to and enjoy some sunset with a little Eyes of the world. Tough tough decision here! Happy voting all!

Anyway, lets hear your favorites!

PSA re Streaming,"Recently someone in an ""official"" discussion (i.e., not on Reddit) indicated that there were discussions to arrange a Dead streaming service.  No more details other than this are available (to me, anyway).  

If a commercial streaming service is introduced, the provider will likely lean on archive.org to, at a minimum, discontinue streaming their Dead boards.  So, while we wait for the next Dead and Co. tour, this is a fine time to take advantage of the current streaming regime and the opportunities it enables, since they may not last forever.

Which venue got it best? I thought this might be easier than just choosing one date from all of them. (could be wrong - there's no easy way)
