0,jun po denis kelly the grateful dead some insight into the l family i became the head of a family an extended community in the psychedelic world that produced a product called clear light and then later windowpane there were twenty eight people spread out around the world mostly in the united state and we made around thirty million dos over ten year we gave away large large quantity at concert this wa very common during that time with the grateful dead and janis joplin and the airplane we’d go to the party the big concert which were the gathering of the tribe you know the psychedelic music fair and the different family would come and give their lsd away i wa the one who built up our distribution network i hung out with the grateful dead took a few drum lesson with bill kreutzmann a a matter of fact i had a backstage pas meaning i’d just walk in and out of the place we called ourselves the order of the golden toad i melted down a seventeenth century french roman catholic chalice and had it cast into golden frog we’d have a ritual initiation after you were with the family for a while and everyone got a golden frog so we all wore these frog on chain that wa our symbol i still have it on a necklace that i wear occasionally by 1970 my face had become known and i had to go underground for the next ten year i wa actively being sought by the drug enforcement administration with a fifty thousand dollar cash reward for information leading to my arrest so i disappeared into the forest of oregon my partner took over the distribution network and i joined my other partner in the lab in actually synthesizing lsd i remember having several argument around the issue of purity with owsley stanley the bear we didn’t want anyone to adulterate our lsd it had to be 250 microgram of 100 percent d normal so that you could have a nondual experience it had to be perfectly dry and absolutely pure and we were quite dedicated to that to control the purity we’d cast it in a thin layer of gelatin then we’d cut it into tiny one tenth of an inch square that you could look right through which is why it came to be known a windowpane so you could no longer adulterate the product but now it would be subject to light and lsd will equilibrate when light hit it it flip from the d normal to the isomer and that make lsd speedy this wa the argument i had with owsley he felt strongly about not subjecting it to light and i wa more interested in preventing people from polluting the product who leaf their lsd lying around in the sun anyway jun po denis kelly

0,how to jam on dark star is it really just a mixolydian vamping on an a and a g it sound so free form and devoid of any structure especially the version from live dead 1969 jerry s soloing ha more of an eerie quality to it a opposed to his typical happy go lucky sound even though it s notated in many place online a a typical dead two chord vamp the a g part is clear during the intro when lyric are sung and when returning to the lyric section however when it really break into jerry soloing it sound completely wild a the intensity build the a g structure becomes le and le apparent and it sound almost atonal i can hear bobby playing a consistent rhythm at time of two chord though it doesn t sound like straight major triad and he often abandon it for a more wild rhythm part phil is a bit all over the place playing some very melodic bass just a very interesting jam that isn t a easy to analyze a something like fire on the mountain even if the chord change are supposedly similar i m just wondering how they go about playing this song when they stray from the normal structure of it without sounding terrible is it just improvising chop this seems like a step above normal improvisation since even the harmony seems to be improvised on the spot at time or maybe they re just tricking me by constantly playing different inversion of a and g let me know fellow deadhead musician

0,tape trading howdy y all i have recently dug out my dad s old tape deck hooked it up to my stereo and been buying up official dead release cassette like crazy on ebay now i m curious if there is still a tape trading community out there i see folk selling their collection on ebay so i know people still have them obviously i know that torch ha passed on to digital trading but honestly the music lends itself so much more to good ole analog now i could always plug my audio interface and dub straight from or etree but i have to say the cassette community fascinates me i guess i should mention i m 28 and a first generation deadhead can anyone out there point me in the right direction thanks

0,favorite playin in the band i personally enjoy the version from 6 22 73 a well a 6 30 73 not to mention 7 1 i don t think there s anything quite like that sound ever again in any version even in later 73 or 74 it s this ridiculously weird few version that are incredibly melodic and bass driven 6 22 and have no moment where any musical idea is left unused and they go into a huge kaleidoscope of color and harmonically interesting whirlwind of pure virtuosity and it s absolutely insane or from 6 30 that version is short and to the point but ha a dark undiscernable quality of pure chaos to it and one can almost envision the music coming out like tendril from the pit of hell itself the 20 minute long version from 7 1 ha almost dark star level quality to it and brings the song to a whole new level they d explore in 74 these few version alone put playin a one of my top song in their catalog because it wa truly a mind boggling and face melting beast of a song

0,what track show have the best drumming according to you and why i love bill the drummer i love bill kreutzmann he is my favorite drummer and he is the main reason i started playing the drum i wa looking for a new instrument to pick up and i had chosen piano so i ordered a keyboard to practice on and that wa going pretty well until i heard bill play on the eye of the world from 10 19 1974 eye of the world ha an amazing drum groove in general and the way billy pull 1000 different tone from his ride cymbal is sick but when he did the fill after the 14 minute mark i knew i had chosen the wrong instrument bill isn t the most tight drummer ever nor is he the most technical drummer but he is in my opinion the most creative drummer ever the way he keep the band together even during the most far out jam is like magic and he is really good at playing simple drum groove with a lot of variation and accent so they don t get boring he s gone from veneta for example ha like 30 variation on the 2 bar kick pattern throughout the song i can go on for hour but a you can see i really like bill kreutzmann and it crazy that so many of the best musician to ever live were in a band together but the music sure show for it the drumming is going really well by now and i get to play along to some of my favorite grateful dead track especially eye of the world which ha been the most fun i ve ever had i m always looking for new track to play along to or just to get inspiration and learn from so i thought i d ask you guy what is your favorite piece of grateful dead drumming it can be from any year obviously the solo drummer year would be most beneficial to me but i m also curious to hear some cool thing from year where mickey wa in the band i tend to feel like after 1976 the 2 man drumming that once shined during the raw psychedelic year now isn t really needed anymore and often end up simplifying the groove and limiting freedom i don t listen to nearly enough music outside of 72 74 to really have a strong opinion on this tho so feel free to show me some example of great duo drummer work and i d be happy to change my opinion tl dr what is your favorite piece of grateful dead drumming and why

0,what is so hypnotic about grateful dead music i saw this question somewhere else and thought i’d share it here your thought question what wa it that wa so mesmerizing or hypnotic about a grateful dead show or their music i went to see an average dead cover band the other night i wasn’t that impressed at first the vocal weren’t that good the guitarist were ok but not great but their drummer and bass player were outstanding and then before i knew it i wa swept up by the music much like at dead show in day gone by it wa very much like i wa under the influence of the pied piper i wa 100 sober it got me thinking the next day could it be their time signature or polyrhythms the resonance of the bass why doe grateful dead music when played live create such a mass hypnosis

0,do not buy from stubhub and other ticket buying tip i have seen too many post today and the last few day about how people have bought ticket on stubhub before and even during the presales and general sale i thought i d put together a psa and quick guide on how to buy ticket without getting ripped off first the psa never buy ticket from stubhub or other most other resellers the exception here being which i ll get into below also never buy platinum ticket from ticketmaster so let s pretend the next tour just got announced and you want to make sure you get seat and don t get ripped off here s what you do first sign up for ticketmasters tm verified fan presale vfp the easiest way to make sure you get a chance to sign up for vfp is to sign up for the dead company newsletter yeah we all hate junk mail but will send out an email with tour date and link to sign up for their vfp any other band that us vfp will likely do the same so this is applicable to them a well you ll also be able to find link to sign up on their site if you d rather not sign up for the newsletter your next step is to wait i didn t think this would really need to be explained but i ve seen enough post proving otherwise just do nothing ticketmaster will send you an email on a certain date usually outlined when you sign up letting you know if you ve been selected or not for the vfp if you have been selected you will get a text message 2 hour before on sale time to buy your ticket ticket will be posted to stubhub and other third party vendor before the presale even start no matter how antsy you are to get ticket do not fall for the trap and do not buy from stubhub if you have not been selected or you are waitlisted for the vfp do not worry it s not a big deal many people claim tm is releasing crappier seat during the vfp to take advantage of eager fan i personally think this may be half true one thing that is true is that tm is definitely not releasing all the seat and will be holding many for general sale so no vfp what do you do now now you wait again and no matter how much your brain is telling you to go to stubhub to get ripped off do not do it see if there are other presales happening depending on the venue there may be ameex presales citi presales local preseales siriux presales etc tm will list all the presales a well a their date and time see if any are applicable to you or if you can google around for code for the credit card presales you will actually need to check out with that specific type of card so a code won t work for those but you get the idea can t find a code or you re not eligible for any of the presales still don t worry keep waiting until general on sale there will still be plenty of ticket available during the general sale ticket sold out too fast during general sale or you couldn t get the specific section you wanted no worry ticket are now sold 6 7 month in advance so you have plenty of time to secure a seat but i d start searching on at this point this is a third party site but you re buying selling directly with other fan and you re only ever allowed to charge or pay the actual face value of the ticket or le this is a legitimate website which i have used dozen of time without a single issue it is especially popular with the jam band crowd so you ll find ticket for plenty of other show in fact for show that aren t even sold out yet i still look there first a i see it a a way to help someone out who s just looking to make their money back for one reason or another and i m not giving more money to tm can t find anything on cash or trade keep waiting when the show start getting a bit closer more and more post will pop up so keep checking back or maybe sign up for a gold membership with them so you can be alerted when post matching your requirement appear also it s a good idea to check back in with tm periodically a they sometimes release more seat closer to the show date they will also sometimes release package for cheaper seat like a 4 pack of lawn for 100 or they start dropping the price of their platinum ticket that haven t sold back to standard ticket price i guess i should also note that you should never buy platinum ticket from tm remember how i wa saying you should never buy ticket from stubhub there actually is one exception closer to show date when the scalper can t sell their ticket they will start dropping ticket price pretty drastically just get whatever they can back on those ticket i m talking like a week out here ticket price typically stay highly inflated and start dropping around 3 week before the show date and usually are cheapest about a week and up to the day of the show many time going for le than face value especially on lawn ticket and le desirable pavilion ticket if you can buy from stubhub for le than face this is the one time you should a the scalper is actually losing money on these seat no ticket for for at or le than face on stubhub then show up to the venue and you will find people selling ticket in the lot for face or le so to sum it up 1 sign up for tm verified fan presale wait for presale 2 still no ticket or not eligible wait look into other presales you re eligible for 3 buy during next presale still no ticket wait 4 buy during general sale 5 couldn t snag ticket in general sale try check back on tm periodically 6 still no luck wait until the show date is close then and only then check stubhub for ticket at or le than face 1 3 week out 7 can t find ticket for face or le on stubhub buy them on lot ticketmaster tip if you don t have a tm account create one you ll need one for the vfp anyway add a credit card to your profile and be signed in before ticket go on sale get the ticketmaster app on your cell phone i sometimes have better luck on mobile than desktop if it s a multi night stand i like to buy saturday ticket first a they tend to sell out faster than friday

0,rationalizing ticket price anyone else feel a little heat with the pricing looking at presale at some of these giant venue ticket on lawn nosebleed are 45 plus fee certainly fair the thing is you re watching the band on a screen and the sound quality is abhorrent generally i remember listening back to a show on sirius from last summer and the quality wa night and day compared to what i heard live ticket closer to the soundboard stage start at 150 fee which seems like quite a lot to spend on a single evening other than sucking it up and or not going are some of you planning to gamble with day of ticket what s your plan

0,525 cd collection of grateful dead jerry garcia now includes dave s 28 525 cd collection of grateful dead jerry garcia now includes dave s 28 hello all i have never been on reddit until now a friendly and fellow fan suggested that i reach out so here i am trying to catch the collective ear life ha thrown me one of it’s curveballs slash hand grenade i am reeling and looking for lifeline however i can i am not a man of mean what i do have is my collection of grateful dead music which represents one of my great love in this life it is the most valuable thing that i own so sometimes it is like that this life and there is reluctantly a great need and my option are limited so i am trying to sell my collection i appreciate all of those that have already reached out in that loving way that deadhead do i love the dead there is real magic and catharsis and uplift and openness in the way they exchanged value with the world in fact in so many way way that i am deeply proud of that value is now in me that particular embodiment and expression that is both unique and universal of the grateful dead can t talk to you without talking to me we re guilty of the same old thing thinking a lot about le and le and forgetting the love we bring that is magic to me that innate and inherent invitation to our better self to leading from the sweeter place inside u while laying plain the accompanying world commentary and matter of fact ness and the music the music that human ache to make and reach into splendor i am grateful that i wa and still am lucky enough to have ear that hear i started seeing the dead back in ’85 and the music hot diggity dog you all know about the music and a well you know that along with the music is a marriage to the lovely and warm hearted beauty of the community that nourishment of both band and fan which ha in many way helped me become the man i am today i love that this unspoken bond of delight and warmth and joy and shared understanding of what it mean to try and lift someone’s spirit the expansion love if you or someone you know would appreciate this treasure please do direct them to the ebay link below i am in need and also feel not especially comfortable with charity what with the world a it is there are many many in need out there in here i feel more aligned with an exchange of value where i also have at least something even partially to be offered it is not my preference to sell this collection i am trying to place balm on a challenging piece of life if i could i would all the best to you and to yours and thank you for reading special to me wrs winter rain now tell me why summer fade and rose die the answer came the wind and rain golden hill now veiled in gray summer leaf have blown away now what remains the wind and rain and like a desert spring my lover come and spread her wing knowing like a song that s born to soar the sky flowing till the water all are dry growing the loving in her eye circle song and sand of time and season will end in tumbled rhyme and little change the wind and rain and like a desert spring my lover come and spread her wing knowing like a song that s born to soar the sky flowing till the river all are dry growing the loving in her eye winter gray and falling rain we ll see summer come again darkness fall and season change gonna happen every time same old friend the wind and rain we ll see summer by and by winter gray and falling rain summer fade and rose die we ll see summer come again like a song that s born to soar the sky morning come she follows the path to the river shore lightly sung her song is the latch on the morning s door see the sun sparkle in the reed silver bead pas into the sea she come from a town where they call her the woodcutter s daughter she s brown a the bank where she kneel down to gather her water and she bear it away with a love that the river ha taught her let it flow greatly flow wide and clear round and round the cut of the plow in the furrowed field season round the bushel of corn and the barley meal broken ground open and beckoning to the spring black dirt live again the plowman is broad a the back of the land he is sowing a he dance the circular track of the plow ever knowing that the work of his day measure more than the planting and growing let it grow let it grow greatly yield note 3 what shall we say shall we call it by a name a well to count the angel dancing on a pin water bright a the sky from which it came and the name is on the earth that take it in we will not speak but stand inside the rain and listen to the thunder shout i am i am i am i am so it go we make what we made since the world began nothing more the love of the woman work of men season round creature great and small up and down a we rise and fall’ lyric by bob weir eric andersen i john barlow ii music by bob weir

0,shower thought on gd and brown if you listen to a few gd show from the early day it becomes clear why a band like van halen had the brown clause in their rider i feel like at least in the early day the dead would have had a somewhat simple show just guy playing instrument and singing and yet when you listen to early recording it seems like something is always messed up it s usually the sound monitor but often also the lighting on stage and crowd management i can t imagine some of these venue putting on show with explosive and crazy lighting etc it must have been terrifying for band which seems to be why the band but all kind of crazy check in their rider i think it s also why they build the wall of sound and why they basically only let their guy set it up

0,the year in review 2018 dave s pick i just wrapped up a full re listening session of all four dave s pick from 2018 and wanted to share some thought and discus this batch with some fellow fan dave s pick 25 11 6 77 this show keep breaking my heart man that first set is legitimately one of the best ever the half step may be the goat tennessee jed is straight heat a rare dupree s and a rockin one at that and even mexicali blue smoke then the second set start samson actually rage and the sunrise is about a good a that song can be but the big jam that look so promising in the track list seem strained it seems like jerry came out disoriented and nothing including scarlet fire and not fade away could really achieve true liftoff truckin kind of save the day but it s too little too late a good show for the series but not nearly a good a it could be 3 5 5 dave s pick 26 11 17 71 when this wa announced my first thought wa ugh more 71 then it showed up in my mailbox wow this set just delivers on all front keith is at this perfect place where he s meshed in with the band but he still sound energized and enthusiastic his fill and lick make some of the more rinse and repeat first set tune shine and the band seems to be in fine form right along with him the major jam other one nfa deliver at every twist and turn the third disc and the bonus disc give u a similar show but with pig pen back sharing keyboard duty and it s a real treat to hear peg s organ with keith s key a rare combo that really shine on this particular release one of my favorite from the series thus far 4 5 5 dave s pick 27 9 2 83 this show is so weird and i totally love it the vocal may be rough and the mix ha it quirk but i m a real sucker for jerry s raunchy 80 tone and the playing here is pretty inspired the first set ha some real fun highlight namely the big railroad blue and the look like the latter song being particularly hot after an inauspicious start with a nearly unlistenable help on the way slipknot brings in the jam and they pretty much never let up from there the estimated eye combo delivers a always space is fantastic and the post space suite is incredibly inspired from start to finish with my personal favorite performance of black peter wrapping a nice bow on everything it s not a perfect show but it ticked a lot of my personal box and i enjoy this one a lot 4 5 dave s pick 28 6 17 76 to me this show is the definition of just ok the playing is sharp the song selection is satisfying but the band isn t taking any real chance and there s a reason you don t see anything from this show on headyversion it s not a bad show by any mean it s just very forgettable save for a pretty cool let it grow jam i ve listened to this one the least so maybe it will evolve with more listens but for now it s not one i see myself returning to much 3 5

0,next big box nye i believe the last mega box wa 30 trip released in 2015 we should be due for another my vote for the next big box release is every new year’s show some are at or below average i’m looking at you mid 80’s but most of them are fantastic many feature such rarity a rare song special guest 3rd set acoustic set etc and for my money it should include the allman bros 12 31 73 3rd set with jerry and bill if you ain’t heard that yet get it there’s an excellent sbd of the full show out there yes we do have most of these show in circulation but maybe something like 12 31 66 is hiding in the vault even so it would be a worthy candidate for a cool box set with room for the obvious bonus like hat noise maker balloon etc i hope dave ha considered this for an eventual release the nye show have always been among the most popular and it would be an interesting alternative take on the band evolution a demonstrated with 30 trip

0,thank you to this subbreddit so a quick story i use to be stationed with this guy back in the day and deployed with him to iraq we both worked closely together and when i get out he chose to stay in fast forward three year and he s currently deployed overseas we keep in touch and he s able to post brief status update to assure people he s fine and what not that wa until about almost a month ago i can t go into specific detail about what happened but long story short someone ransacked where he slept and stole a bunch of his personal belonging including his mp3 player that he had his wife reached out to me and asked for my help since i collect music a a hobby asking if i had any grateful dead in my collection so she can get it off to him quickly since that what he chose to listen to while over there for the next couple of month honestly i m a 31 year old black guy from south carolina they were on my radar to collect one day because i could see how they are popular but that wasn t going to be anytime soon but i made it a mission to find everything i could in a couple of week so that we can get it off to him by today so he can get it in a timely manner so my journey began to acquire this discography and let me just say holy shit dude i did not know how massive their discography wa i have this initial phase where i just do my research on whoever i m looking for and i wa not expecting them have so many live album initially i thought they were all just the same performance like any other artist but how wrong i wa besides the couple of blog that i saw with people dedicating their love to gd this sub showed me that this band just isn t your typical band and their live album just aren t retelling s of track that were made popular dave s dick s pick really opened my eye to that when i wa reading up on thread here and why people loved certain cd s from certain show you guy and your discussion about how and why you fell in love with them when you went to concert a young teen late adult are great to read if you re going to do a sub for an artist band then this sub is the template for doing it the right way i always buy my music but a anyone can see most of if not all these album are limited edition so i broke my cardinal rule and i went on a quest to find the best copy so that i can send it off to my friend who bought all of his album and ripped them before he left and it wa surprising to see how helpful this sub wa with that a well i m not going to mention specific thread or site that i used but it s quite easy to search and you ll find them and now that i m done 180 album 107 gb s later all 320 no flac for space and compatibility reason i just wanted to say thank you all for building this sub and making it so that someone like me can discover what make a band great in the eye of their fan without being all super weird and obsessed like other sub are keep doing what you re doing because i m sure there are lurker like me who appreciate this sub but never actually say it sorry this wa so song but thank you again to everyone here

0,big river working man blue hi recent deadhead rookie fell in love with the band within the last year still working through the huge catalogue of music but i m a guitarist and when i first heard the dead version of big river this summer on the tour i knew i knew the lick from somewhere else i sat in with a country artist about a month ago who requested that i know the main lick for working man blue so a i got it under my finger during our session i knew i knew the lick from somewhere else but couldn t put my finger on it until it clicked that the dead used it for big river despite johnny s version having it s own distinct riff i ve tried googling and researching but doe anyone know why they decided to mesh merle with johnny on their version of big river i like the working man blue riff better and i like the lyric and melody of big river better so for me and my group we ve decided to just play big river the dead way a i feel a a combo it s better than either one individually from a music aspect but still i m curious if anyone know anything else about it it s not the most common substitution to take a very recognizable riff from another song and put it on a song with another very recognizable riff

0,how much acid did the grateful dead really digest i am very curious about the dead s acid intake i know they except for pigpen started in 1965 but i have also heard at their trippiest period 1969 1970 that especially jerry and phil were not tripping much if at all then 1972 it seems that the dead are dosed most of the time the most evident on film is sunshine daydream concert august 27 1972 you can literally see jerry s eye and brain flowing in and out od consciousness and in that 105 degree heat wave that must have been one intense trip perhaps yielding their best performance of all time especially on the 32 minute dark star

0,book review fare thee well so i finally got the selvin book from my library and and got through it over the weekend i have returned the book because there wa a number of hold so i don t have exact quote or pin site if you want to call me out because i don t have a page number idgaf these are my general thought ymmv i lived in san francisco and read selvin when he wrote for the chronicle i thought his review were interesting but had an edge like he wa trying to defend rock n roll a his image of what it should be i don t recall any of his review of dead related band at the time so i can t say if he ha had a change of mind a lot of his review of grateful dead show are available online and while he ha a familiarity with the band and material i don t think the review are particularly insightful i do think that he ha a certain entitlement shared with many other rock critic of his generation in this podcast he claim that there ha been no good music made after 1984 this is obviously hyperbole a i read his positive review of music post 1984 but it is a pretty poor attitude for someone who wa paid to write objectively about music for decade after 1984 it wa an opinion that lot of baby boomer rock critic held and still do hold on to the book first of all i don t think he made anything up the book seems well researched and he is a real journalist who would not make stuff up i m sure he ha a source or two for each factual assertion that he make that doesn t mean that there aren t mistake there are small one such a how often a song wa played or the last time it wa played they are not that consequential to the whole of the book but are readily verifiable in the age of internet database there are also inconsistency within the book early in the book he discus the phil and phriends 1999 show then when he is discussing the ftw rehearsal he claim that trey had never played more than 10 minute on stage with member of the dead just flat wrong and contradicted by his same book his assertion later in the book wa to criticize phil s limit on practice but it wa just not true the main objective of the book seems to be to make phil and jill lesh out to be money grubbing monster that is clear and any claim different by selvin is bullshit the only people whose motif he question are the leshes i don t disagree that phil and jill took control and rubbed people the wrong way but the author always cast it with a sinister motive never doe he even consider that the numerous business failure of the grateful dead were because the band lacked leadership and lesh intended to remedy that then there are the malicious personal shot at phil his look his singing etc these do nothing to advance any theme or overarching point in the book these pop up so often i think the subtitle of the book should be i think phil sings like shit if he pointed out the personal failing of the other band member a much a he did phil it would be 3 volume he barely touch on bobby s personal issue or the fact that mickey is virtually deaf and hasn t been able to keep time in 30 year no mention at all of bobby s atrocious slide guitar playing which hasn t gotten better since the early 80 s but constant cheap shot at phil he also fails to acknowledge that phil had the power to impose his will because he wa the soul of the grateful dead the reason surviving band found success wa because phil wa on bass since selvin isn t a deadhead he may not have known this going into the story but his research should have made it abundantly clear another thing i noticed in the book wa a lack of quote generally a book like this ha lot and lot of quote from the subject especially since they are alive it give the book life and make the story believable by failing to get interview the book read like a lot of second hand and third hand story while the book ha a lot of source in his bibliography it is organized in a confusing way possibly purposely the text of the book rarely explains what source he is using to tell the specific story instead he relies on a bibliography at the end of the book however it is impossible to tell what source he relied on for each part of the book instead of organizing source by chapter they are simply listed in alphabetic order at the end of the book meaning you would have to read almost every source to determine what one the author relied on in each chapter i would argue that this is intentional because his sourcing relies on second and third hand report and his specific slant on the story anyway that is just my two cent and poorly organized thought i m not really looking for response but go at it if you want

0,rambling and backpedaling from a critic i m a second generation deadhead parent were casual fan some aunt and uncle toured heavily through the 70 and from birth the band ha provided the soundtrack to my life i didn t start going to dead related show until roughly 2002 and despite having been involved with phish and other various jam band i wa totally blown away by the dead scene s warmth and eclecticism there is something unique to grateful dead music and the surrounding community that i ve had a hell of a time trying to articulate but it s like the convergence of yin and yang dark and light and a the music chug along the band and audience work together toward fleeting moment of magical absurdity when beauty and love unify with grime and fear and all party involved can catch a glimpse of our true nature through the music a far a rock and roll band go nobody wa a good a the dead at patiently building tension a a unit toying with release and then finally resolving the tension or not to the ecstatic delight of the listener it s those moment in addition to triumphant transition boundless improvisation etc that invoke epiphany for both the audience a well a the performer there wa a reddit post month ago that i can t find now in which somebody pretty eloquently described the quality of many grateful dead song to seem a though we join the song already in progress the song wa never written nor wa the song ever begun or finished it ha always existed and the band serf a a conduit pulling the tune out of the air and presenting it to the crowd it s safe to say that garcia is on the short list of performer who could control an audience with nothing more than a subtle facial expression musical virtuosity aside like nearly every facet of the band their music and the surrounding community his paradoxical personality fit in to the yin yang concept previously mentioned a far a hunter s lyric go what can one say in my opinion music stand a head above other art form in term of it ability to hint at answer to the imponderable question we struggle to answer over the course of our life when i first started going to show i had the common experience of feeling like everybody except me wa in on a huge joke this wa so powerful that i would sometimes be on the verge of a panic attack feeling totally isolated a the crowd around me wa boogying and sharing a special moment it felt like the universe wa fucking with me i kept going to show eventually finding my groove and settled with the understanding that we re all having this experience together and the best way to approach the awkward existential dilemma of feeling like the butt of a cosmic joke is to contribute to the community in a positive way be it through singing dancing helping vending anything other than being an asshole really is a contribution i have no idea where i m going with this i m sort of beating around the bush a to not sound like an off the rail acid casualty but it seems obvious to me that the grateful dead were divinely influenced or helped along by some unseen force there i said it i tend to be hyper critical of band continuing the tradition of performing these sacred song a if my opinion and criticism have any influence and i see now that in doing so i ve come across a a mope and i m likely limiting my own enjoyment of certain concert by having a standard i m speaking specifically about dead co who i have consistently shit on since the beginning in my defense i m certainly not alone here and my criticism are shared by maybe half of the people i speak with this divide among fan ha of course happened a few time in dead history when a portion of maybe jaded fan have become disillusioned with the direction of the band in regard to the music or business or community aspect it come from good intention fan of old fear progress that may move away from the noble value the scene wa built upon i think considering the condition of our culture that fear is justified hyperbole and personal feeling aside the objective fact are the core four are still touring after more than 50 fucking year since the grateful dead wa born and we should be rejoicing even if they just went up on stage and laid an egg every night which they don t they chose a guitarist who ha done a beyond respectable job of learning the catalog and adapting to the music that wa originally out of his wheelhouse in term of style perhaps in part to having selected mayer we have a new generation of fan digging the music and the grateful dead brand is bigger than ever i ve never seen so many stealies berthas and dancing bear out in public a i have the past two summer it seems like every small town i visit ha a gd tribute band and more so than at any other concert i ve attended dead related show have ever increasing diversity in the audience 13 year old and 80 year old all getting down together so the music play on a long a capable performer can pull the tune from out of the air and we have an obligation to help facilitate the magic i mentioned earlier the number of people these song and show have touched on a deeply emotional and spiritual level must number in the million at this point the last thought i want to put down is that even though the grateful dead is a decade old american tradition with a large catalog of timeless song and even though popularity is high and there is no sign of slowing to quote the motto of the merry prankster nothing last fortunately there will be more band that have a similar impact on society and help to shape the generation s they spring from let s sow the seed for those who will follow u by supporting music education and cultivating creativity in our child

0,today of the dead an elegy for jerry by robert hunter an elegy for jerry by robert hunter jerry my friend you’ve done it again even in your silence the familiar pressure come to bear demanding i pull word from the air with only this morning and part of the afternoon to compose an ode worthy of one so particular about every turn of phrase demanding it hit home in a thousand way before making it his own and this i can’t do alone now that the singer is gone where shall i go for the song without your melody and taste to lend an attitude of grace a lyric is an orphan thing a hive with neither honey’s taste nor power to truly sting what choice have i but to dare and call your muse who thought to rest out of the thin blue air that out of the field of shared time a line or two might chance to shine a ever when we called in hope if not in word the muse descends how should she desert u now scar of battle on her brow bedraggled feather on her wing and yet she sings she sings may she bear thee to thy rest the ancient bower of flower beyond the solitude of day the tyranny of hour the wreath of shining laurel lie upon your shaggy head bestowing power to play the lyre to legion of the dead if some part of that music is heard in deepest dream or on some breeze of summer a snatch of golden theme we’ll know you live inside u with love that never part our good old jack o’diamonds become the king of heart i feel your silent laughter at sentiment so bold that dare to step across the line to tell what must be told so i’ll just say i love you which i never said before and let it go at that old friend the rest you may ignore

0,one year after jerry s death robert hunter wrote him a beautiful letter dear jg it’s been a year since you shuffled off the mortal coil and a lot ha happened it might surprise you to know you made every front page in the world the press is still having fun mostly over lawsuit challenging your somewhat umm patchwork last will and testament annabelle didn’t get the ec horror comic collection which i think would piss you off a much a anything nor could doug irwin accept the legacy of the guitar he built for you because the tax assessment on them icon enriched a they are is more than he can afford short of selling them off the upside of the craziness is your image is selling briskly enough that your estate should manage something to keep various wolf from various familial door even after the lawyer are paid how it’s to be divided will probably fall in the hand of the judge an expert on celebrity will said in the news that yours wa a blueprint on how not to make a will the band decided to call it quits i think it’s a move that had to be made you weren’t exactly a sideman but nothing’s for certain some need at least the pretense of retirement after all these year can they sustain it we’ll see i’m writing this from england by the way much clarity of perspective to be had from stepping out of the scene for a couple of month what isn’t so clear is my own role but it’s really no more problematic than it ha been for the last decade a long a i get word on paper and can lead myself to believe it’s not bullshit i’m roughly content i’m not exactly mr business i decided to get a personal archive together to stick on that stagnating computer site we had really started pouring the mustard on i’m writing for cry out loud my diary on it besides running my ego full tilt what’s new i’m trying to give folk some skinny on what’s going down i don’t mean i’m busting the usual suspect left and right but am giving a somewhat le than cautious overview and soapboxing more than a little they appointed me webmaster and i hope they don’t regret it there are those in the entourage who quietly believe we’re washed up without you even should time and circumstance prove it to be so we need to believe otherwise long enough to get some self sustaining operation going or we’ll never know for sure it’s matter of self respect maybe it’s a long shot but this whole fucking trip wa a longshot from the start so what else is new your funeral service wa one hell of a scene maureen and i took barbara and sara in and sat with them mg mountain girl waited over at our place manasha and keelan were also absent none by choice everybody from the band said some word and steve especially did you proud speaking with great love and candor annabelle got up and said you were a genius a great guy a wonderful friend and a shitty father which shocked part of the contingent and amused the rest after awhile the minister said that that wa enough talking but i called out from the back of the church wait i’ve got something and charged up the aisle and read this piece i wrote for you my voice and hand shaking like a leaf man it wa weird looking over and seeing you dead a slew of book have come out about you and more to follow perspective is lacking it’s way too soon you’d be amazed at the number of people with whom you’ve had a nodding acquaintance who are suddenly expert on your psychology and motivation your music still speaks louder than all the b who you were not the mess you got yourself into only a very great star is afforded that much inspection and that much forgiveness there wa so much confusion on who should be allowed to attend the scattering of your ash that they sat around for four month it wa way too weird for this cowboy who wa neither invited nor desirous of going i said good bye with my poem eulogy for jerry at the funeral service it wa cathartic and i didn’t need an anti climax a surreal sidelight weir went to india and scattered a handful of your ash in the ganges a a token of your worldwide stature he took a lot of flak from the fan for it which must have hurt a bunch of them decided to scapegoat him presumably needing someplace to misdirect their anger over the loss of you in retrospect i think weir wa hardest hit of the old crowd by your death i take these thing in my stride though i admit to a rough patch here and there but bob took it right on the chin shock wa written all over his face for a long time for any with eye to see some of the guy have got band together and are doing a tour the fan complain it’s not the same without you and of course it isn’t but a reasonable number show up and have a pretty good time the insane crush of the latter day gd show is gone and that’s all for the best from the show i saw and report on the rest the crowd is discovering that the sense of community is still present matured through mutual grief over losing you this will evolve in more joyous direction over time but no one’s looking to fill your shoe no one ha the presumption been remembering some of the key talk we had in the old day trying to sus what kind of a tiger we were riding where it wa going and how to direct it if possible driving to the city once you admitted you didn’t have a clue what to do beyond composing and playing the best you could i agreed put the weight on the music stay out of politics and everything else should follow i trusted your musical sense and you were good enough to trust my word trust wa the whole enchilada looking back walking down madrone canyon in larkspur in 1969 you said some pretty mindblowing stuff how we were creating a universe and i wa responsible for the verbal half of it i said maybe but it wa your way with music and a guitar that wa pulling it off you said that’s for now this is your time in the shadow but it won’t always be that way i’m not going to live a long time it’s not in the card then it’ll be your turn i may be alive and kicking but no pencil pusher is going to inherit the stratosphere that so gladly opened to you recalling your statement though often helped keep me oriented a my own star murked below the horizon while you streaked across the sky of our generation like a goddamned comet though my will to achieve great thing is moderated by seeing what come of them i’ve assigned myself the task of trying to honor the original vision i’m not answerable to anybody but my conscience which if le than spotless doesn’t keep me awake at night maybe it’s best personally speaking that the power to make contract and deal the remains of what wa built through the decade rest in other hand i wave the flag and rock the boat from time to time since i believe much depends on it but will accept the outcome with equanimity just thought it should be said that i no longer hold your year of self inflicted decline against you i did for awhile felt ripped off but have come to understand that you were troubled and compromised by your position in the public eye far beyond anyone’s power to deal with star shit who can you really trust is it you or your image they love no one can understand those dilemma in depth except those who have no choice but to live them you whistled up the whirlwind and it blew you away your substance of choice made you more malleable to force you would have brushed off with a characteristic sneer in earlier day well you know it to be so let those who pick your bone note that it wa not always so so here i am writing a letter to a dead man because it’s hard to find a context to say thing like this other than to imagine i have your ear which of course i don’t only to say that what you were is more startlingly apparent in your absence than ever it wa in the last decade i remember sitting in the waiting room of the hospital through the day of your first coma not being related i wasn’t allowed into the intensive care unit to see you until you came to and requested to see me and there you were more open and vulnerable than i’d ever seen you you grasped my hand and began telling me your vision the crazy densely packed phantasmagoria way beyond any acid trip the demon and mechanical monster that taunted and derided telling you endless bad joke and making horrible pun of everything and then you asked point blank have i gone insane i said no you’ve been very sick you’ve been in a coma for day right at death’s door they’re only hallucination they’ll go away you survived thanks you said i needed to hear that your biographer aren’t pleased that i don’t talk to them but how am i to say stuff like this to an interviewer with an agenda i sometimes report thing that occur to me about you in my journal a the moment release it in my own way in my own time and they can take what they want of that obviously faith in the underlying vision which spawned the grateful dead might be hard to muster for those who weren’t part of the all night rap session circa 1960 61 session that picked up the next morning at kepler’s bookstore then headed over to the stanford cellar or st mike’s to continue over coffee and guitar there were no hippy in those day and the beat had bellied up there wa only u v 50’s consciousness there no job to be had if we wanted them just folk music and tremendous dream yeah we dreamed our way here i trust it so did you not so long ago we wrote a song about all that and you sang it like a prayer the day between last song we ever wrote context is lost even now the sixty were a long time ago and getting longer a cartoon version of our time satisfies public perception our continuity is misunderstood a some sort of strange persistence of an outmoded style bead bell bottom and peace sign but no amount of pop cynicism can erase the suspicion in the mind of the present generation that something wa going on once that wa better than what’s going on now and i sense that they’re digging for what it is and only need the proper catalyst to find it for themselves your guitar is like a compass needle pointing the strange way there i’m wandering far afield from the intention of this letter a year’s report but this year wasn’t made up only of event following your death in some roughly chronological manner it reached down to the root of everything shook the earth off and inspected them the only constant is the fact that you remain silent various dance are done around that fact don’t misconstrue me i don’t waste much time in grief insofar a you were able you were an exponent of a dream in the continual act of being defined into a reality you had a massive personality and talent to present it to the world that dream is the crux of the matter and somehow concern beauty consciousness and community we were and are worthy insofar a we serve it when that dream is dead there’ll be time enough for true and endless grief john kahn died in may same day leary did linda called 911 and they came over and searched the house found a tiny bit of coke and carted her off to jail in shock if the devil himself isn’t active in this world there’s sure something every bit a mean institutional righteousness without an iota of fellow feeling but a i figure that’s the very reason the dream is so important it’s whatever is the diametric opposite of that human kindness trust me that i don’t walk around saying this wa what jerry would have wanted to drive my point home what you wanted is a secret known but to yourself you said yes’ to what sounded like a good idea at the time no’ to what sounded like a bad one i see more of what leadership is about in the absence of it it’s an instinct for good idea an aversion to bad one compromise on indifferent one power is another matter power is not leadership but coercion people follow leader because they want to i know you were often sick and tired of the conflicting demand made on you by contentious force you invited into your life and couldn’t a easily dismiss you once said to me in 1960 just say yes to everybody and do what you damn well want maybe but when every yes’ becomes an iou payable in full who’s coffer is big enough to pay up fuck ’em if they can’t take a joke would be a characteristic reply unfortunately you’re not around to explain what wa a joke and what wasn’t it all boil down to signed piece of paper with no punch line appended i know what i’m saying in this letter can be taken a hundred way a always i just say what occurs to me to say and can’t say what doesn’t could i write a book about you no didn’t know you well enough let those who knew you even le write them you were canny enough to keep your own self to yourself and let your finger do the talking speaking of personal matters’ wa never your shtick our friendship wa testy i challenged you rather more than you liked having a caustic tongue in later year you preferred the company of those capable of keeping it light and non judgmental i think it must always be that way with prominent and powerfully gifted person i don’t say that for the most part your inner circle weren’t good and true they’d have laid down their life for you i’d have had to think about it i mean a star is a star is a star there’s no reality check if the truth were known you were too well loved for your own good but that smack of psychologizing and i drop the subject forthwith all our song are acquiring new meaning i don’t deny writing with an eye to the future at time but our mutual folk blue and country background gave u a mutual liking for song that dealt with sorrow and the dark issue of life neither of u gave a fuck for candy coated shit psychedelic or otherwise i never even thought of u a a pop band you had to say to me one day after i’d handed over the eagle mall suite look hunter we’re a goddamn dance band for christ’s sake at least write something with a beat okay i handed over truckin’ next how wa i to know i thought we were silver and gold something new on this earth but the next time i tried to slip you the heavy stuff you actually went for it seems like you’d had the vision of the music about the same time i had the vision of the word independently terrapin shame about the record but the concert piece the first night it wa

final version i eked out many year later you said apologetically i love it but i’ll never get the time to do it justice i realized that wa true time wa the one thing you never had in the last decade and a half supporting the grateful dead plus your own trip took all there wa of that the rest wa crashing time besides a you once said i’d rather toss card in a hat than compose but man when you finally got down on it you sure knew how the pressure of making regular record wa a creative spur for a long time but poor sale put the economic weight on live concert where new material wasn’t really required so my role in the group waned a difficult time for me being at my absolute peak and all i had to go on the road myself to make a living it wa good for me i developed a sense of self direction that didn’t depend on the dead at all this served well for the song we were still to write together you sure weren’t interested in flooding the market you knew one decent song wa worth a dozen cobbled together piece of shit saved only by arrangement i guess we have a few of those too but the percentage is respect ably low pop song come and go blossom and wither but we scored a piece of americana my friend sooner or later they’ll notice what we did doesn’t die the way we do i’ve always believed that and so did you once in awhile we’d even call each other mister and exchange congratulation other

even with the band out of commission i don’t know if this is some sort of denial that the game is finished or if the intuitive impulse is a sound one i feel it’s better to have it than not just in case because once it’s gone there’s no bringing it back the force will disperse and settle elsewhere a business that can’t support itself is of course no business at all just a locus of dissension so the reality factor will rule diminished a we are without you there is still some of the quick bright spirit around i mean you wouldn’t have thrown in your lot with a bunch of belly floppers would you

0,an elegy for jerry by robert hunter august 9 1995 an elegy for jerry by robert hunter august 9 1995 jerry my friend you ve done it again even in your silence the familiar pressure come to bear demanding i pull word from the air with only this morning and part of the afternoon to compose an ode worthy of one so particular about every turn of phrase demanding it hit home in a thousand way before making it his own and this i can t do alone now that the singer is gone where shall i go for the song without your melody and taste to lend an attitude of grace a lyric is an orphan thing a hive with neither honey s taste nor power to truly sting what choice have i but to dare and call your muse who thought to rest out of the thin blue air that out of the field of shared time a line or two might chance to shine a ever when we called in hope if not in word the muse descends how should she desert u now scar of battle on her brow bedraggled feather on her wing and yet she sings she sings may she bear thee to thy rest the ancient bower of flower beyond the solitude of day the tyranny of hour the wreath of shining laurel lie upon your shaggy head bestowing power to play the lyre to legion of the dead if some part of that music is heard in deepest dream or on some breeze of summer a snatch of golden theme we ll know you live inside u with love that never part our good old jack o diamond become the king of heart i feel your silent laughter at sentiment so bold that dare to step across the line to tell what must be told so i ll just say i love you which i never said before and let it go at that old friend the rest you may ignore

0,hunter letter to garcia august 1996 august 1996 robert hunter published this email to jerry dear jg it s been a year since you shuffled off the mortal coil and a lot ha happened it might surprise you to know you made every front page in the world the press is still having fun mostly over lawsuit challenging your somewhat umm patchwork last will and testament annabelle didn t get the ec horror comic collection which i think would piss you off a much a anything nor could dough irwin accept the legacy of the guitar he built for you because the tax assessment on them icon enriched a they are is more than he can afford short of selling them off the upside of the craziness is your image is selling briskly enough that your estate should manage something to keep various wolf from various familial door even after the lawyer are paid how it s to be divided will probably fall in the hand of the judge an expert on celebrity will said in the news that yours wa a blueprint on how not to make a will the band decided to call it quits i think it s a move that had to be made you weren t exactly a sideman but nothing s for certain some need at least the pretense of retirement after all these year can they sustain it we ll see i m writing this from england by the way much clarity of perspective to be had from stepping out of the scene for a couple of month what isn t so clear is my own role but it s really no more problematic than it ha been for the last decade a long a i get word on paper and can lead myself to believe it s not bullshit i m roughly content i m not exactly mr business i decided to get a personal archive together to stick on that stagnating computer site we had really started pouring the mustard on i m writing for cry out loud my diary on it besides running my ego full tilt what s new i m trying to give folk some skinny on what s going down i don t mean i m busting the usual suspect left and right but am giving a somewhat le than cautious overview and soapboxing more than a little they appointed me webmaster and i hope they don t regret it there are those in the entourage who quietly believe we re washed up without you even should time and circumstance prove it to be so we need to believe otherwise long enough to get some self sustaining operation going or we ll never know for sure it s matter of self respect maybe it s a long shot but this whole fucking trip wa a longshot from the start so what else is new your funeral service wa one hell of a scene maureen and i took barbara and sara in and sat with them mg waited over at our place manasha and keelan were also absent none by choice everybody from the band said some word and steve especially did you proud speaking with great love and candor annabelle got up and said you were a genius a great guy a wonderful friend and a shitty father which shocked part of the contingent and amused the rest after awhile the minister said that that wa enough talking but i called out from the back of the church wait i ve got something and charged up the aisle and read this piece i wrote for you my voice and hand shaking like a leaf man it wa weird looking over and seeing you dead a slew of book have come out about you and more to follow perspective is lacking it s way too soon you d be amazed at the number of people with whom you ve had a nodding acquaintance who are suddenly expert on your psychology and motivation your music still speaks louder than all the b who you were not the mess you got yourself into only a very great star is afforded that much inspection and that much forgiveness there wa so much confusion on who should be allowed to attend the scattering of your ash that they sat around for four month it wa way too weird for this cowboy who wa neither invited nor desirous of going i said good bye with my poem at the funeral service it wa cathartic and i didn t need an anti climax a surreal sidelight weir went to india and scattered a handful of your ash in the ganges a a token of your worldwide stature he took a lot of flak from the fan for it which must have hurt a bunch of them decided to scapegoat him presumably needing someplace to misdirect their anger over the loss of you in retrospect i think weir wa hardest hit of the old crowd by your death i take these thing in my stride though i admit to a rough patch here and there but bob took it right on the chin shock wa written all over his face for a long time for any with eye to see some of the guy have got band together and are doing a tour the fan complain it s not the same without you and of course it isn t but a reasonable number show up and have a pretty good time the insane crush of the latter day gd show is gone and that s all for the best from the show i saw and report on the rest the crowd is discovering that the sense of community is still present matured through mutual grief over losing you this will evolve in more joyous direction over time but no one s looking to fill your shoe no one ha the presumption been remembering some of the key talk we had in the old day trying to sus what kind of a tiger we were riding where it wa going and how to direct it if possible driving to the city once you admitted you didn t have a clue what to do beyond composing and playing the best you could i agreed put the weight on the music stay out of politics and everything else should follow i trusted your musical sense and you were good enough to trust my word trust wa the whole enchilada looking back walking down madrone canyon in larkspur in 1969 you said some pretty mindblowing stuff how we were creating a universe and i wa responsible for the verbal half of it i said maybe but it wa your way with music and a guitar that wa pulling it off you said that s for now this is your time in the shadow but it won t always be that way i m not going to live a long time it s not in the card then it ll be your turn i may be alive and kicking but no pencil pusher is going to inherit the stratosphere that so gladly opened to you recalling your statement though often helped keep me oriented a my own star murked below the horizon while you streaked across the sky of our generation like a goddamned comet though my will to achieve great thing is moderated by seeing what come of them i ve assigned myself the task of trying to honor the original vision i m not answerable to anybody but my conscience which if le than spotless doesn t keep me awake at night maybe it s best personally speaking that the power to make contract and deal the remains of what wa built through the decade rest in other hand i wave the flag and rock the boat from time to time since i believe much depends on it but will accept the outcome with equanimity just thought it should be said that i no longer hold your year of self inflicted decline against you i did for awhile felt ripped off but have come to understand that you were troubled and compromised by your position in the public eye far beyond anyone s power to deal with star shit who can you really trust is it you or your image they love no one can understand those dilemma in depth except those who have no choice but to live them you whistled up the whirlwind and it blew you away your substance of choice made you more malleable to force you would have brushed off with a characteristic sneer in earlier day well you know it to be so let those who pick your bone note that it wa not always so so here i am writing a letter to a dead man because it s hard to find a context to say thing like this other than to imagine i have your ear which of course i don t only to say that what you were is more startlingly apparent in your absence than ever it wa in the last decade i remember sitting in the waiting room of the hospital through the day of your first coma not being related i wasn t allowed into the intensive care unit to see you until you came to and requested to see me and there you were more open and vulnerable than i d ever seen you you grasped my hand and began telling me your vision the crazy densely packed phantasmagoria way beyond any acid trip the demon and mechanical monster that taunted and derided telling you endless bad joke and making horrible pun of everything and then you asked point blank have i gone insane i said no you ve been very sick you ve been in a coma for day right at death s door they re only hallucination they ll go away you survived thanks you said i needed to hear that your biographer aren t pleased that i don t talk to them but how am i to say stuff like this to an interviewer with an agenda i sometimes report thing that occur to me about you in my journal a the moment release it in my own way in my own time and they can take what they want of that obviously faith in the underlying vision which spawned the grateful dead might be hard to muster for those who weren t part of the all night rap session circa 1960 61 session that picked up the next morning at kepler s bookstore then headed over to the stanford cellar or st mike s to continue over coffee and guitar there were no hippy in those day and the beat had bellied up there wa only u v 50 s consciousness there no job to be had if we wanted them just folk music and tremendous dream yeah we dreamed our way here i trust it so did you not so long ago we wrote a song about all that and you sang it like a prayer the day between last song we ever wrote context is lost even now the sixty were a long time ago and getting longer a cartoon version of our time satisfies public perception our continuity is misunderstood a some sort of strange persistence of an outmoded style bead bell bottom and peace sign but no amount of pop cynicism can erase the suspicion in the mind of the present generation that something wa going on once that wa better than what s going on now and i sense that they re digging for what it is and only need the proper catalyst to find it for themselves your guitar is like a compass needle pointing the strange way there i m wandering far afield from the intention of this letter a year s report but this year wasn t made up only of event following your death in some roughly chronological manner it reached down to the root of everything shook the earth off and inspected them the only constant is the fact that you remain silent various dance are done around that fact don t misconstrue me i don t waste much time in grief insofar a you were able you were an exponent of a dream in the continual act of being defined into a reality you had a massive personality and talent to present it to the world that dream is the crux of the matter and somehow concern beauty consciousness and community we were and are worthy insofar a we serve it when that dream is dead there ll be time enough for true and endless grief john kahn died in may same day leary did linda called 911 and they came over and searched the house found a tiny bit of coke and carted her off to jail in shock if the devil himself isn t active in this world there s sure something every bit a mean institutional righteousness without an iota of fellow feeling but a i figure that s the very reason the dream is so important it s whatever is the diametric opposite of that human kindness trust me that i don t walk around saying this wa what jerry would have wanted to drive my point home what you wanted is a secret known but to yourself you said yes to what sounded like a good idea at the time no to what sounded like a bad one i see more of what leadership is about in the absence of it it s an instinct for good idea an aversion to bad one compromise on indifferent one power is another matter power is not leadership but coercion people follow leader because they want to i know you were often sick and tired of the conflicting demand made on you by contentious force you invited into your life and couldn t a easily dismiss you once said to me in 1960 just say yes to everybody and do what you damn well want maybe but when every yes becomes an iou payable in full who s coffer is big enough to pay up fuck em if they can t take a joke would be a characteristic reply unfortunately you re not around to explain what wa a joke and what wasn t it all boil down to signed piece of paper with no punch line appended i know what i m saying in this letter can be taken a hundred way a always i just say what occurs to me to say and can t say what doesn t could i write a book about you no didn t know you well enough let those who knew you even le write them you were canny enough to keep your own self to yourself and let your finger do the talking speaking of personal matter wa never your shtick our friendship wa testy i challenged you rather more than you liked having a caustic tongue in later year you preferred the company of those capable of keeping it light and non judgmental i think it must always be that way with prominent and powerfully gifted person i don t say that for the most part your inner circle weren t good and true they d have laid down their life for you i d have had to think about it i mean a star is a star is a star there s no reality check if the truth were known you were too well loved for your own good but that smack of psychologizing and i drop the subject forthwith all our song are acquiring new meaning i don t deny writing with an eye to the future at time but our mutual folk blue and country background gave u a mutual liking for song that dealt with sorrow and the dark issue of life neither of u gave a fuck for candy coated shit psychedelic or otherwise i never even thought of u a a pop band you had to say to me one day after i d handed over the eagle mall suite look hunter we re a goddamn dance band for christ s sake at least write something with a beat okay i handed over truckin next how wa i to know i thought we were silver and gold something new on this earth but the next time i tried to slip you the heavy stuff you actually went for it seems like you d had the vision of the music about the same time i had the vision of the word independently terrapin shame about the record but the concert piece the first night it wa played took me about a close a i ever expect to get to feeling certain we were doing what we were put here to do one of my few regret is that you never wanted to finish it though you approved of the final version i eked out many year later you said apologetically i love it but i ll never get the time to do it justice i realized that wa true time wa the one thing you never had in the last decade and a half supporting the grateful dead plus your own trip took all there wa of that the rest wa crashing time besides a you once said i d rather toss card in a hat than compose but man when you finally got down on it you sure knew how the pressure of making regular record wa a creative spur for a long time but poor sale put the economic weight on live concert where new material wasn t really required so my role in the group waned a difficult time for me being at my absolute peak and all i had to go on the road myself to make a living it wa good for me i developed a sense of self direction that didn t depend on the dead at all this served well for the song we were still to write together you sure weren t interested in flooding the market you knew one decent song wa worth a dozen cobbled together piece of shit saved only by arrangement i guess we have a few of those too but the percentage is respect ably low pop song come and go blossom and wither but we scored a piece of americana my friend sooner or later they ll notice what we did doesn t die the way we do i ve always believed that and so did you once in awhile we d even call each other mister and exchange congratulation other people are starting to record those song now and they stand on their own for some reason it seems worthwhile to maintain the grateful dead structure rex the website gdp the deadhead office the studio even with the band out of commission i don t know if this is some sort of denial that the game is finished or if the intuitive impulse is a sound one i feel it s better to have it than not just in case because once it s gone there s no bringing it back the force will disperse and settle elsewhere a business that can t support itself is of course no business at all just a locus of dissension so the reality factor will rule diminished a we are without you there is still some of the quick bright spirit around i mean you wouldn t have thrown in your lot with a bunch of belly floppers would you let me see is there anything i ve missed plenty but this seems like a pretty fat report you ve been gone a year now and the boat is still afloat can we make it another year what form will it assume it

0,if psychedelics are religion then the grateful dead are gospel side note find me a better morning dew than europe 72 i ve long said that the dead are dao the daoist philosophy in it s most rudimentary sense is centered around chaos and order being the two most fundamental force of nature more specifically that from chaos emerges order and that order it will in turn disintegrate into chaos you should be hearing theme of the big bang here on the vinyl europe 72 this expression of dao is presented most subliminally in the grateful dead s music side 5 of the record feature an incredible recording of truckin truckin is a very 50 s style rock n roll tune from weir they begin playing truckin at the lyceum and a soon a the song end they continue to stretch the performance out in to some of the best acid jazz improv the dead have on recording the order of the uptight 50 s rock n roll soon descends into utter chaos that will leave uninitiated wondering what the fuck are we listening to any seasoned deadhead will not be scared off by the dissonance and disharmony a this performance bleeds into a multi minute section of cacophony the dead better than any band before or sense understood the necessity of peak and valley in a performance just like any great piece of literature the dead understood that to achieve true glory all cannot remain perfect and peaceful a the record flip and the chaos becomes far too much to bear the dead transition into what i believe is there most glorious performance of morning dew ever it is the stuff of legend the kind of thing that will send chill down the spine of the most dose soaked deadhead and the greenest of participant over side a and b of the final record of europe 72 order decomposes into chaos only to have chaos miraculously rescind to order once again i have been hard pressed to find a performance that more perfectly encapsulates that indescribable beauty that is the grateful dead than the end of europe 72 for those who have not been baptized in the torrent of terrapin we all seem like lunatic listening to never ending song however for those fortunate enough to have drunk the blood of garcia and eaten the flesh of lesh europe 72 is a hallmark of the holy the dead are dao

0,one of the first time seeing phil and friend around somewhere between 1999 and 2002 i wa given a huge box filled with cassette tape around 60 those tape combined with a 1989 chevy conversion van that had a cassette player changed my life every cassette in the box had a case and every case had date location set list and hand drawn art sometimes the art included stamp with stealies bear skeleton and well you get the idea especially because this sort of collection wa and is super common for the crowd at a dead show so i don t really need to go any further explaining it a quick google search returned this now this isn t my box but it very similar to what is in this image a few year ago i met a kid who wa about the same age i wa when the box wa gifted to me he wa me from the past which i m sure people here can relate to he wa bright eyed and just getting into the dead giving him that box felt better than when i originally received the box at a show especially because i added a few tape to that box myself the look on his face and knowing how i felt when it happened to me priceless hopefully one day he too will get to experience that feeling of giving the box away to someone who will appreciate it an unbroken chain if you will i haven t had a car with a cassette player since the van i mentioned earlier i sold van to to a wookie year ago well it wa traded he didn t pay for it with money money he paid for it by bartering but that s another story for another time i just started driving a new car well it s an old car but it s new to me it ha a cassette player i no longer own a single cassette i m happy i gave the tape away to a deserving young man but i just wish i had at least 1 tape to throw in the cassette player in my car

0,tour story i know some of you may think these rank up there with war story on the trail of the dead misadventure and other close call by ificouldonlyremember first show i saw were msg 9 20 9 21 1982 seat so high up in the blue ring i could almost touch the ceiling remember being puzzled next i saw the two brendan byrne show where stephen still came on stage 4 16 4 17 1983 i wa a huge csn and neil fan so i wa hooked of course stephen still did not show up every night i mostly saw east coast and summer show very few california show greek spring 85 new year 86 87 i really regret i never made it to red rock most show i saw with my taping partner and best friend from high school and college first time we went to worcester fall 1984 i may have been a little altered before the show a motorcycle cop frisk me for no good reason luckily i am clean saw many show there not just dead and every time we went to worcester after that we would see the same guy striking some macho pose somewhere providence 1985 older classman hitch a ride with u showed up already drunk carrying 6 pack get to providence ironically park right outside the police station after the show i found a pair of brass knuckle on the street next to my car idiot is drinking beer walking down street police officer tell him to pour it out he argues grabbed he push back other officer come running over and drag him into alley we leave before he come out somewhere in ohio summer 1985 we crash in an over crowed campground in the morning owner ha a fit and we bail asap parked outside when police go roaring in similar situation after some philly show over crowded motel 20 deadhead in every room my friend who wa driving nudged the bumper of a police car on the way out of the parking lot and yet somehow miraculously we manage to get away rochester fall 1985 friend bought an old school bus going on tour old school would we like to ride to rochester with them no bus drivetrain exploded in the middle of ny state saw them arriving a we walked out of show after second show we drove all night back to central ct in order to go to class next morning hampton 1986 did not have ticket for first night but do have extra pair each for other two make big sign find someone to trade afterwards sell other pair for face value to a waiting couple that wa the ethos i thank my dear friend peter for first pointing that out to me kingswood toronto 6 30 87 for some reason i did not go to this particular show fyi when you are going through canadian custom wrapping a bong up in a towel and shoving it into the trunk doe not constitute hiding it moved car to holding area searched found a small amount of combustible did not find some tiny little scrap of paper friend afraid going to jail finally told to leave and go back to u they walk out to their car and drive off into canada made show and back safely to u 1987 capitol theater landover maryland kicked out of show before it even started for bad behavior went outside and traded for a new ticket actually a good seat by stage on phil’s side see same security agent he keep looking at me but cannot be sure i am the same person after first night at oxford 1988 we slept in my car and i foolishly had parked in a fire lane in the morning drove down the road right before the police arrived and started searching everyone that could have been unfortunate for me afterwards we went swimming in a lake and i saw a vision i remember to this day two friend are driving cross country middle missouri spotted and tailed by car full of dea agent going to conference they fit the profile pulled over by local police dea agent salivating at prospect of major drug bust separated both tell same story small amount marijuana under dashboard actually carrying something all together different wrapped up in sleeping bag that morning my friend packed sleeping bag decided he did not like it and re packed searching car finding nothing agent pick up sleeping bag squeeze it then toss on ground taken to station local police fed up with big shot agent they write driver ticket for an illegal lane change believe it or not a traffic ticket and they are let go acquaintance driving through colorado in brother’s car pulled over officer is this your car no my brother’s officer is that your brother’s grateful dead sticker foolishly no it is mine officer then i know if i search your car i will find drug and he did some thing were very different in the 80’s n2o balloon were not yet a problem mdma ecstasy wa legal until 1986 legal marijuana wa but a pipe dream literally and most people still smoked brown imported pot unless they had some really good connection i used to have a matched pair of aiwa tape deck i kept in constant motion making copy of my master to trade for this and that it wa not all fun and game in the early 80 there wa a security agency called the a team based in ct completely unprofessional biggest group of asshole and bully they handled all the security for new haven one of the reason the dead stopped going there new haven coliseum wa ringed by door leading right out onto the street one night some friend knocked down one of these guy and only about 1000 people rushed in before they could close the door saratoga 1984 perhaps i wa partying more than wa wise with a group of friend cannot find them after show totally lost wandering around all night the ground are huge there finally find my car in the morning closest i came to a really bad mental experience i have actually seen more really messed up bad shit happen outside other non dead show i have seen more than enough people get arrested

0,recreate the wall of sound im stoned so im replying to this guy right and we re talking about a wall of sound festival and since im high i did the math and you guy i think we could do it ill paste down here what i replied to his post but i felt like it outgrew just a comment the im bored just link me to a cool show 9 17 82 anyways let build a wall so we need at least like let say 5 million right 500 000 for the band 500 000 for security 2 mil for the wall and one mill to fix the problem first break down the donation amount miracle donor 25 000 rich donation 5 000 someone really want to see it 1 000 ticket 100 i need a miracle 0 i can probably say at least 12 people would be miracle donation not all at once of course nor at the beginning but i do think if we could raise enough at the beginning at least a dozen famous deadhead would be down maybe not but i have a hunch alot of head are pretty well off obviously not the majority but c’mon we all know we boogie with some pretty rich cat from time to time i got miracled a seat ticket at shorline face value wa almost 200 i really think about 500 would donate this amount i myself really want to see this happen i dont know exactly how many people this can be but i figure we just take the number of box set that grateful dead sell at a time and use that to estimate i mean everyone know the show are literally a few soconds on a keyboard away from streaming live on your device of choice and anyone who really care know how to find them in a better formant so if there are 15 000 people willing to spend 100 on a cool box and some cd’s i honestly think it safe to assume there are 15 000 people willing to spend 1000 to create and experience something that could possibly change the world or the history of the dead next is ticket a quick google search show that in 2017 there were 623 000 ticket sold but we need to break that down first 15 off attributed to tour head who are the same person with mulitiple ticket 529 500 then of those people i estimate another 15 did not buy ticket 415 117 next i’ll just assume only half of those people really want to go to the wall of sound experience 200 00 and then half of that group may really want to see this happen or not give a damn if it happens in addition though i honestly think this could become a major event some kind of cultural reckoning for the modern day and age i think 100 000 ga ticket could be sold i think 100 is a pretty fair price for a show i feel like this isnt too much to earn and save even when you are a homeless musician read my old post that wa my life and certaily would create a much hipper scene than say outside land which is 400 so to anyone with an interest in the dead spending just 100 to again create and experience the actual wall in all it glory what a bargain plus just like dead and co it will attract plenty of the general festival crew and some other people who may not be head but are down to check out some kind of wall of sound experience 100 to create a literal deadhead paradise many different culture organic farmer baby boomer marijuana proffesionals confused teenager would be interested in a 100 ticket to an amazing day and a different life if even temporarily adding it all up im writing this all on the fly also interested to see the result 12 25 000 100 5 000 15 000 1 000 100 000 100 300 000 500 000 15 000 000 10 000 000 25 800 000 so maybe i messed the math up but it look like this is doeable like very doable if anyone would like to help please message me i guess or go start your own group working towards this goal we should be very radical about this tldr we are the future the future is right now let build a wall of sound
0,have any of you ever dragged a reluctant friend to a show i m unskilled in the subtle conversion of friend into deadhead it seems i always come on too hard or soft for my passion to ever really rub off on those not already interested above all however my so simply loathes their music and will bitch and moan whenever i try to play it in any context i think way back i might ve overzealously talked up my love for the band to the point where i creeped her out and scared her away from ever even considering enjoying it one special occasion when we decided to trip only time i played it and she wa totally grooving to it though she ll hardly admit this now a a playful ultimatum i ve told her that i want to take her to a dead and company show at which point i ll shut the hell up about the band forever this got me thinking have any of you ever dragged a reluctant friend to a show wa the experience torture for them did they become instant convert something in between for the record i ve long abandoned any imposition approach to the grateful dead anymore everyone dig what they dig and obviously that will never change sometimes i get that but i guess with some people ex significant others close friend family member etc it s easy to be a little bummed that you ll never have the powerful connection with them that is sharing a dead show and it s easy for me at least to feel the urge to if necessary drag them there and have them decide for themselves at least once

0,favorite keith moment in e72 in general i ve been getting super into e72 lately since i ve not yet listened to a bunch of show and keith absolutely shine in almost every set 2 3 jam whether it be 5 26 epilogue prelude or 4 8 mlbj in dark star he absolutely kill it and make the piano an absolute force to be reckoned with i listened to the 4 24 d d wharf rat earlier today and wa absolutely blown away at the level of what would become 73s space jazz sound that i heard in it there wasn t a single time i didn t feel like the band wasn t playing a anything but a single unit and the way keith would play with the rest of the rhythm section and compliment jerry lead wa utterly absurd in how live they were able to make shit sound so next level out there and psychedelic almost mystically out of the pool of fractal imagery that they wove i like to believe the avant garde leaning of european musician in the early 70 and late 60 wa a really big contributor to their sound and the location themselves 4 16 truckin too space the other one me my uncle the other one not fade away goin down the road feeling bad not fade away another example of just outright weird playing by them and truckin waste no time in going from just a normal day at the office to sounding straight out of the playbook of a philosopher neologism concerning a world composed entirely of the abstract it barely even fit into the confines of the other one aside from the lyric a much a it is a journey into interstellar space and slowly watching the earth and other planet disappear a the sun itself loses it unique aspect of itself and you just become enveloped in entirely your sense of self disappearing and becoming one with the playing only to be drawn back into the normal music itself of the post long jam section and normal life it s pretty fucking great anyone have anything they d like to share i think people sometimes underplay keiths contribution while simultaneously just passively acknowledging he played piano for them in their most popular year

0,sad but happy today mark the last grateful dead show it wa the end of a tumultuous summer tour jerry wa walking dead the last of my 13 show but then all this happened and in some way i think that if jerry would have lived the grateful dead might have somehow diminished in people s eye when jerry passed it gave the music a chance at new life and today we have a vibrant and growing scene not a scene that is on life support thank you jerry for a real good time and thank you for letting there be song to fill the air that now have been given new life and hopefully we will see year and year of the dead always a hoot

0,how did the fan atmosphere surrounding the grateful dead evolve to the point it did in 1995 i am a younger fan of the grateful dead wa 6 in 95 so the only interaction i have had with fan ha been at dead and company show which i have enjoyed immensely i am very fascinated with the history surrounding the band and their unique evolution and collection of fan throughout time from ken kesey and the electric kool aid acid test to seeing bill walton standing tall amongst a field of fan spanning greater than a half century of music history however from reading into their history something that i can’t grasp is how intense negative the overall fan atmosphere wa toward the end in 1995 how something so wonderful and fantastic grew towards an ending with a tour from hell i understand that jerry’s health wa not good and the band wasn’t playing the quality show it had in the past but when how did the crowd change to get to the point it did in 1995 i know dead and company is not the grateful dead but rather more a continuation of the beauty this band brought but the energy and friendliness i have found at these show have been amazing and i couldn’t imagine a toxic atmosphere like many people described 95 to be i may also be talking out my as because i never experienced a grateful dead show with jerry garcia but more insight into this time period would be greatly appreciated
0,dead and co show so their last show of the year are at lockn so no fall winter tour like last year anyone else thinking they’re just gonna take a full year off or something they’ve been hitting it pretty hard on the touring for the most part so they need a break in my opinion but i’m hoping they don’t pas up a summer tour next year thought

0,the d on dick s pick 2 there isn t a lot of substance to this post sorry i m sinking deeper and deeper into the dead i wouldn t consider them the greatest band of all time but paradoxically they re becoming my favorite i decided to listen to dick s pick volume 3 10 31 71 before bed mainly because it s the shortest and i don t have time for a full on all out one right now i have listened to 3 4 and 36 before at first i wasn t all that impressed with this dark star i guess i ve listened to the live dead and a few other 69 version so many time that it wasn t what i wa expecting it wa le focused and more meandering not bad at all but not a immediately memorable a the live dead version wa when i first heard it but then about 14 minute in the jam suddenly went to a place so unexpected and honestly gorgeous that i started laughing at how fucking good it wa i had been ready to write it off maybe even dig around for another but the dead reeled me back in and didn t let go from then on then they went somewhere no le compelling that i can t even begin to describe before transitioning into sugar magnolia in a way that melted my face i m sure they have dozen and dozen of other show that are greater that i will eventually get to and lose myself in but this may have been my peak experience listening to the dead so far i have no doubt other moment will top it but i guess i m just saying i love this band is all anyway yeah i guess i would recommend the dp2 dark star

0,camping near boulder where s the all night shakedown gonna be
0,a boulder resident guide to boulder dead and co ton of info i ve seen lot of people asking question so i just want to lay out a couple of the important deets 1 folsom field ha changed their bag policy this year def check out their website a it s more similar to the nfl policy 2 parking is expensive but folsom is smack in the middle of campus which is smack in the middle of boulder aka lot of free parking in neighborhood around the area check out any of the street on the hill area across broadway street where a lot of student live also check out madison ave or adam ave off of 30th ave also pine or spruce or mapleton between folsom st and 28th finally if you have a camper a lot of people park it between 28th and 30th on mapleton near the ballfields it ll be fine for the weekend and it s 1 5 mile to the venue 3 there are several after party after show all over town the fox theater on the hill is having one the boulder theatre the post brewery on pearl opened by the former headmaster brewer at dogfishhead amazing homestyle food and beer the bohemian biergarten on pearl the lazydog on pearl etc etc so if you re a little too high still there s plenty to do on the hill across broadway or on the pearl st mall a short 20 walk from the stadium 4 food after the show will be found in the same place the hill and pearl a lot of pizza but one of my favorite late night spot is illegal pete s on 15th and pearl open til 2am and serf up food similar to chipotle but much better there will be more late night option on the hill a it s the student area there s a place there called half fast sub which is around 10 minute walk from folsom ton of sub to choose from and open late 5 dispensary are everywhere however there are winner and there are loser i ve shopped at almost every dispensary in town and have been smoking for a good long while here s my favorite and why verde natural 3rd and pearl best bud in boulder hand down possibly the best on the front range soil grown organic gorgeous flower and a super friendly staff i d never smoke anything else except that it is pricey 180 300ozs out the door but if you want the best go there magnolia road 30th and canyon best price on anything non flower i never buy edible anywhere else if you want edible go here incredible selection a well flower is good enough and reasonably priced helping hand herbal 10th and pearl another place that produce phenomenal flower also all organic they do all their genetics in house and have produced some unique and killer flower again a bit pricey but if you want good flower this is my second choice 14er holistics mapleton between 28th and 30th i love this store they frequently have ounce for 125 and i think it s the best flower to coat ratio in boulder you can usually walk out of there with an ounce of something incredible for under 180 they have the only jack herer i know of in boulder they work directly with jack herer s son to ensure the phenos and genos stay true to the flower the man himself grew if you have an id driver license or passport you can legally buy cannabis in colorado so go enjoy it i believe you can now buy up to an oz with any id used to just be a 1 4 with out of state keep in mind that ounce limit is for 1 dispensary so if you want say edible and an ounce you can buy an ounce from wherever then go somewhere else and buy edible 6 food my favorite the post 13th and pearl like i said earlier the old headmaster brewer from dogfish head opened this place up it s a little on the expensive side not crazy but not 10 either but they do homestyle southern cooking and family style eating so you order large basket of incredible fried chicken then large portion of food like mashed potato beet salad coleslaw mac n cheese chard etc did i also mention the beer is fantastic hapa sushi pearl between 11th and broadway some guy i play soccer with helped start this place phenomenal sushi for a landlocked state way above sea level their vegetarian roll is the best i ve ever had but everything is wonderful they have happy hour everyday except sunday from 2 30 5 30pm a well a a late night happy hour from 10 00 12 00 friday and saturday you can get two roll for 8 which for u sushi freak is an unheard of price the food is truly outstanding west end tavern pearl between 9th and 10th again more homestyle cooking but it s fantastic think bbq and fried chicken this place also ha the biggest selection of whiskey maybe in the state a well a a ton of unique and small batch beer amazing rooftop with a perfect view of the flatiron mountain sun pearl between 15th and 16th the quintessential dead bar in boulder usually dead music playing amazing beer and fantastic bar food i hate calling it bar food because it s so much better but it s burger sandwich salad wing etc lot of cool dead music related memorabilia ok the wall fior di latte pearl between 14th and 15th best god damn ice cream it s gelato in reality in the city with a ton of fresh made selection i love that place and figured a few stone head might a well 7 what to do before and after if you have time there are some great day activity in boulder a few of my recommendation saturday morning farmer market frequently named one of the best in the country the boulder county farmer market is located on 13th street between canyon and arapahoe it start early 8 or 9 i believe and run until 2 ton of good produce food food truck fruit etc my favorite is the palisade peach that are now in season best peach in the country aside from maybe georgia boulder book store on pearl is a must for anyone who like to read or enjoys a good bookstore 3 level of book they have about anything you can think of hike chataqua those flatiron what we call those huge rock right next to boulder a t look like a clothes iron press into the mountainside are gorgeous from a distance but even better to hike around if you re an experienced hiker try the royal arch trail do not do this trail if you are not adequately prepared it s not super super tough but it s about 3 hour round trip with decent elevation gain so worth it drive up baseline road if you follow baseline west it turn into flagstaff road which weave it way up the mountain there are several place to stop for great view of boulder there is another place called realizaiton point that ha great trail that are much easier a you start higher up and my favorite place is a half mile or so pat realization point called lookout gulch beautiful view of the continental divide you can see 14 or 15 13k peak in the distance fiske planetarium right on campus it is one of the most state of the art planetarium in the country tonight they have a laser show using their famous liquidsky visualizer with some incredible dead show from 77 so if your eye are wide a little early in the day check out a show it s totally worth it to even just see an hour long movie there escape room on pearl if you ve never done an escape room then your missing out you and up to 7 friend get put in a room and have to solve a mystery together by finding clue and connecting dot it s a ton of fun when you re a little spun there is a ton to do around town and the mountain but tthose are some of my favorite that don t take a ton of time post show some of my favorite thing to do are walk around the gorgeous cu campus go down to boulder creek which run right through town and listen to the river going down to pearl and busking a bit 8 be kind we keep getting invited back because our scene is easy to manage the cop are totally handsoff a long a you don t act a complete full this mean drinking smoking and fun are all fully permissible in the parking lot no worry about undercovers here drug are the last of boulder police worry be smart and it s a little slice of heaven 9 this is just me but please please please clean up after yourself it s insane to me how much trash deadhead left behind last year please just carry your trash to a trash bin and be

0,how i got into the dead just thought i’d share my story my close friend died of cancer during our sophomore year of high school she had lent me her copy of american beauty i had noticed a dead patch on her backpack the day i met her on a public bus when i wa 14 or so and figured she must be cool though i didn’t know much about the dead i never listened to the cd a few year later my godfather showed up to make up for lost time and took me to best buy to buy me some cd a a gift i bought among a few other thing american beauty in her honor i ended up liking it well enough but never really listened closely on the night of sept 11 2001 i wa in my first year of college at berkeley at a candlelight vigil when someone on stage played brokedown palace on his guitar for his brother who’d been in the tower only later did i realize it wa on american beauty i later moved to san francisco and got into the music history especially quicksilver messenger service and the jefferson airplane i also picked up anthem of the sun i remember listening to it on a sunny day driving though the rolling hill of napa it wa beautiful then i moved to nj and bought europe 72 dick’s pick 4 and stepping out from the princeton record exchange in the order loved em but that wa enough for then my acoustic duo also played brokedown palace and brown eyed woman on a semi regular basis and i enjoyed fiddling around with friend of the devil solo living in england after that where they are le known didn’t help thing but i kept listening to what i had on occasion i managed to hear the woodstock set at some point a well only during my second run through graduate school after having spent most of my time listening to jazz especially free jazz and fusion and classical music especially 20th century stuff did i really arrive at the wider world of the dead it’s been 3 year or so now since then when i really got it i have now heard hundred of show and i’m currently doing the day after sbd headphone tour this year with dead and company i could not care le about the drug culture or the meaning of jerry’s or pigpen’s etc life etc i’ve never been to a show to me it’s not the lifestyle that make the dead i wonder if i might actually be turned off by the whole thing not sure oh well to me the dead are amazing artist musician songwriter improvisers etc i love the immediacy of it all for me the dead remind me of my life different event along the way they’ve been a very personal pursuit it’s just been me and the archive now that i’ve been on this community on reddit i thought i’d share my story with others thanks for reading any thought similar story

0,over the top phone use during show first i m super appreciative of the technology which make couch tour possible and the real time update of what s happening at any given show a anyone who follows along audio video stream can attest it s been an amazingly cool way of connecting w other head and sharing the awesomeness of this music that written i wanted to suggest some baseline rule of etiquette around cell phone use during a show any show actually not just but i guess i care le about taylor swift show and think there would be no way of getting that particular audience aboard some of these issue were highlighted for me most recently during the camden show photo if you want to take a photo at the show you should feel free there are some great backdrop and lighting effect that are worth capturing if that s your thing however people should take picture with a little impact or obstruction to others in their area and that includes those both in front and behind you turning off your flash is the most obvious courtesy and something people should do before the show start if they plan to take pic a much a reasonably possible photo should be taken quickly so you re not holding up a phone in someone s line of sight for a really extended amount of time video sigh this is a tougher one but capturing an entire 18 minute dark star on video while holding your phone up high above your head and obstructing a fellow head s real life view of the dark star is at best inconsiderate and at worst downright frustrating for more than a few people at least that s my experience a far a streaming go i d personally like everyone all over the world to enjoy what the band is doing live but not at the expense of those at the show and certainly not for an extended amount of time i d suggest that if someone want to take video and or stream the show they find a spot where they won t obstruct those around them even step into an aisle screen brightness ok i m feeling frustrated on this one because it s flashing me back to last friday night and the kid in front of me he must have had his phone brightness set on alien ship light from close encounter seriously it felt like a supernova in the middle of section 204 we re all part of a group at a show and while everyone is different no one ha the right to detract from the main event texting i guess it s the same a above i don t care who s texting just be considerate and aware of others man re reading this i think it sound pretty anal but frankly i don t like being the guy to ask someone to put their phone down or lower the radiation poisoning brightness of their screen these seem like normal consideration to me and an appropriate way to see a show or i m just old and will be yelling at kid to get off my lawn any day now

0,my first show and i m forever grateful just thought i d add my story for those who are interested i started listening to the dead in middle school while i wa experimenting with phsycadelic rock tried my best to get into it with moderate reults until i stumbled upon the dead s americana side during that time however i never knew how much energy the dead could harness in a live concert setting i sort of lost interest until about a year ago when one of my teacher began recommending some of his favorite show to me this opened the door for me i started branching out and listening to whatever piqued my interest on and slowly began to steep myself in dead lore i thought of myself a a head and felt that i had reached the apex of the experience i wa proved wrong last night dead and co at noblesville i wa a bit skeptical knowing that this wasn t quite the original dead but knew that it wa the closest i would get to it i wasn t able to partake or get lifted during the show but i d soon find out that i wouldn t need to i learned what the saying there s nothing like a grateful dead concert meant albeit dead and co concert now the head that were there made me feel like i wa family like i wa a dear friend who they simply hadn t become acquainted with yet everytime i got excited a new face would look at me with a smile by the time i had to go had to leave early for the 3 hour drive i wa almost moved to tear i didn t want to leave what felt like my newfound group of friend when i left i think everyone around me said goodnight in one way or another and made sure to bid me farewell ever since last night i ve been in the deepest lowest of mood simply out of longing to be back there with them with bobby and the boy and everyone else like me who came to bask in the sweet sound of their music i felt like they and everyone around were trying to say welcome home i may only be able to experience this a couple more time due to the inability to travel but i can say that i ve truly been blessed thanks for reading and thanks for caring

0,dark star sunday volume ii last week we tackled two studio version of dark star the one that ended up a the single and a lyric le outtake today we cover a big unanswered question when wa the first live dark star the answer is we don t really know here is what we do know dark star probably didn t make it s live debut until after it wa recorded in the studio in november of 1967 but before we get into the potential candidate let s listen to a pre november 1967 jam where we can pretty clearly hear the band touching upon theme that would soon become dark star 09 03 1967 feel free to skip forward to about the 2 30 mark jerry spends several minute playing around with the main dark star theme and chord change this is a must listen legend ha it that robert hunter wa at this show in rio nido and composed the lyric while listening to this improvised jam that may be a bit of revisionist history but it s certainly a romantic image with that out of the way we can turn to the first dark star for a long time many assumed it wa 12 13 1967 at the shrine aud in los angeles no recording circulates but this wa listed in various setlist database the current consensus among dead historian seems to be that this show may never even have taken place see for a discussion the first live recording we have for dark star come from at the carousel ballroom the recording is clipped slightly at the beginning but we otherwise get a complete and relatively straightforward edition more or le true to the studio version recorded two month earlier so wa this the first live dark star maybe wa dark star played in a show in november or december of 1967 that doesn t have any tape circulating also maybe if you ask me it seems almost appropriate that a song that often seems to just musically ooze forth from the ether began it s life in a similar manner

0,hope y all have a great time at the show this tour unfortunately i ll be unable to go this year i wa slated to go to citi field but after getting into an argument with one of my friend a very long story the friend group promptly abandoned me and gave away my ticket really hurt right now because none of them love this band like i do on top of not having any local friend anymore my dad is extremely kind and a total non head and he offered to go with me but my heart s just not in it anymore their shitty action just took the wind completely out of my sail and i have no interest in going now when i look at my hat and listen to the lad i just feel bitter i think it would be cool to talk about how you guy were introduced to the music one of my favorite part about the band is that their career spanned so much time that people have really different entry point my cousin eddie is a huge head and while i feel a little guilty that i haven t asked him this particular question before i know he started following them around in the late 80 s with his best friend adam they ve told me some awesome story and hanging out with eddie at citi field last year wa a huge bonding experience for u for me personally i used to go to a summer camp where eddie worked a the garage band guy he taught me how to play bass when i wa younger and had a much different taste in music than i do now in 2014 i had my heart broken and wa in a pretty dark place before then i d heard of the grateful dead but didn t really pay them much mind or understand them that much i wa going through a lot of music a heartsick people do and they just struck me so hard before that i listened mainly to band like pink floyd and jethro till who while still amazing largely made me want to kill myself lol i think it wa music never stopped or something similar that to me just said pick yourself up man there s a whole lotta life to live during that summer i picked up guitar and me and eddie would listen to the music play it albeit shittily and he would teach me about the band through personal story and book what a magical fucking time i really miss that eye of the world will always be my favorite tune because of those time ever since i ve been totally entranced by their music and hardly listen to much else bobby in particular continues to be my idol in term of guitar even though i adore jerry i just love the way he play especially in the 70 s even though i m nowhere near his level of chop yet i d like to think that the way i play is mainly influenced by him tangentially my two friend marty and sam who were and are far more accomplished musician than myself would always sit outside the bunk with their guitar and play all sort of stuff a lot of the time when they were playing some really complicated shit i d ask them what it wa and they would say john mayer this wa initially before 2014 so i just kinda wrote it off but acknowledged how complex and good it wa when jm teamed up to make it wa like a puzzle piece fitting snuggly into place i m very happy that i wa able to include mayer and the dead in my life in such a personal serendipitous way anyway what about you guy how did you find this music

0,grateful dead book club session 1 deal by bill kreutzmann this is the first discussion thread for a virtual book club about our favorite band a couple week ago i suggested this book and a number of you have said that you were up for discussing it i ll list a few possible discussion point below and jump off topic but feel free to bring up any thought criticism or question you have about the book a few of my takeaway the history of billy before the dead almost all biography of the band cover the story of jerry and to a lesser extent bobby and phil but the other guy just seem to show up at magoo s pizza in 1965 it s interesting to get the background of another band member billy s relationship with mickey often they are discussed a a single unit most of the other time the discussion is about mickey and his crazy instrument world music etc it is really interesting to read about how mickey wa integrated into the band also the fact that billy felt freed up after mickey left the band and they played with one drummer the biggest reveal of the book wa the resentment billy felt when mickey wa thrust back into the band for the last show in 74 before the hiatus that wa frank and honest expression from billy discussion of drug i think this wa the most honest discussion of drug of any of the book on the band i have read mickey seems to have the same thought experience that many of u have had some drug are good others not so much sometimes they were used too much other time they were great he also didn t seem to sanctify lsd a much a some i have seen it wa a great tool for the band and a whole hell of a lot of fun but he didn t treat it like a sacrament or religious experience after the dead this is the first book that gave anything more than glib treatment to the music they made after july 1995 he didn t sound all that excited about many of the reunion up until the book wa written however the book wa written before ftw and dead and co i wonder if he would write about it differently today thing to keep in mind while discussing the book when the book wa written and what ha happened changed since any agenda of the author not necessarily negative but is there something he want to convey through the book any part of the book that seem dubious or are contradicted by other book interview a lot of the history of the band is behind the haze of intoxication so there is bound to be inconsistency who and why do you favor one telling so have at it everyone disagree and discus but be civil not everyone ha the same experience with the band or it bibliography so give suggestion of further reading listening if you can finally how about some suggestion for another book to discus in 2 3 week we will make that decision by the end of the week in this thread have at it everyone

0,a request to boomer or anyone hey all so i’m a younger head and i’ve had the privilege of seeing various grateful dead reincarnation over the past few year no i never saw jerry mainly due to the genetic lottery and the million of year of humanity that brought my birth to a later year that being said it seems like almost every show i’ve attended ha been slightly dampened by baby boomer dead head not being respectful at show here are a few thing i’ve noticed over the past year that baby boomer seem to gravitate towards at show outside of their younger counterpart not saying all boomer do this and not saying younger folk don’t a well but it’s been my experience 1 phone at show this first thing you’d think would come from those damn millennials yet i notice far more older folk texting during the show slowly with one finger looking at voicemail taking photo with your flash on take photo but for god’s sake turn off your flash flash in a dark arena pointed at a lit stage 30 yard away doesn’t look good no need i understand that emergency happen but unless what you’re doing on your phone is an emergency put the phone away if you’re going to have your phone out turn down the brightness and turn off the flash 2 inebriation this can really just be pointed out to people in general but i’ve noticed a complete lack of self awareness on the part of the older crowd getting shit faced drunk at show and falling over your neighbor is just plain disrespectful to the fan and the band at the recent bobby and phil show i stood next to an older couple and the woman literally spilled three cocktail on me before i asked her to relax they left their seat and went to the bar at least four time during each set and smelled like the back of a limo they couldn’t even stand by the end of the show please be respectful 3 talking loudly sure all of u at some point during a show turn to our partner next to u and say something along the line of holy shit did you just hear that and that’s perfectly fine what’s not fine is having an entire conversation for two full song while being completely unaware that you are shouting you’re at a concert it’s loud that doesn’t mean you should shout over the music any conversation you need to have can wait until set break it’s really hard to tune out an entire conversation taking place around you i’ve really tried and it just doesn’t make the show better for people around you sorry for the long rant this weekend in chicago wa full of beautiful music and memory that will last a lifetime but if you’ve been lucky enough to have more of these memory than other people around you don’t put a damper on their evening this really applies to anyone of any age i told my wife that i treat concert the same way i treat being at the movie everyone is there to see the show put away the cell phone keep talking to a minimum and be respectful of people around you

been the rose estimated eye of the lost saint of wharf sugar magnolia e don t ease me in fob nakamichi 700 with bass eq cassette master sony d5m maxell dxliis dolby b d taped by bob wagner transferred by charlie miller from greeting all i recall driving up to utica for this one with johny v flato and doug s brother only johnny had a ticket i wa fortunate to get one at the top of the off ramp where we were giving other fan direction to the show shakedown street wa an appropriate opener it wa melee outside the place lot of fan not ticket at one point someone busted the glass window surrounding the arena letting a stream of people in once inside i ran into a bunch of friend from oneonta had a great time leaving the show johnny and i could not find our ride we ended up speaking to a guy named mark on the way to a motel mark wa from u of vermont ended up sharing the room with him that night and staying friend for year to come a ride to hartford the next morning wa not a problem at all and there is nothing like a friday the 13th well there we were and here we are it wa a crazy night with the boy i had the lucky opportunity to feel the grasp of big steve s hand during this one yes it is no wonder that he is a psychologist nice strong man that always made garcia safe great show nice languid shakedown open remember only do one not two flashed back on this one a couple of week ago furthur it is a great example of the time reno centennial coliseum on alabama greatest story ever told friend of the cc rider brown eyed cassidy it must have been the rose minglewood china cat i know you rider feel like a franklin s estimated eye of the the other black around good lovin e don t ease me in audience recording nak cm700 s taped by steven martin or check out a charlie miller sbd of set from if you like your jerry solo a little more up tempo this is the tape to get not the best quality but like a lot of early 80 s show there are not too many sbds available so this is probably all we have to go by this is some of the quickest jerry i have ever heard especially on the also a couple tease not mentioned on the list he s gone before eye and dear prudence before black peter and holy smoke i thought i d trawled out all the hot 82 but i just heard the stranger franklin s and i m stunned stranger take a bit to get going but the final jam is sizzling and weird and the franklin s tower is totally over the top the tune is taken at a very fast clip and jerry go absolutely banana and the second and third jam seriously worth the price of the show if not the whole tour get it a good sounding aud too very sparkly ton of high if a bit thin down low berkeley community theater on jack althea mama mexicali blue friend of the devil minglewood blue 1 deal 1 the music never franklin s estimated ollin woman are black good lovin e brokedown palace master soundboard cassette dat cdr 1 w matt kelly 2 w hamza el din or check out an aud taped by mark from the final show of this four night run get of to a blistering start with a rip roaring jack straw featuring some lighting lead from garcia decent harmony throughout what a great start jerry slows thing down a bit with althea his vocal performance is pretty brutal here with craggy vocal and lot of lyric flub but his playing is still very enthusiastic bob s cowboy duo of mama is often a throw away but this version is hoe with some slick soloing and some nice accompaniment by brent especially during mexicali it also feature an extended jam that pump the energy backup after the lackluster althea jerry slows thing down yet again with friend of the devil but unlike althea this is sweetly played with respectable vocal brent doe some nice work and bob even take a short solo before jerry rip out a great one minglewood is next and it take jerry a minute to join in but when he do the pace pick up there is some nice jamming including a short call and response between jerry and matthew kelly on harp again brent s presence is felt wit a great solo deal is a high energy set closer with amazing soloing by garcia kelly s harp however seems out of place the high energy continues through most of the second set with great version of some classic the that open the set feature some great group improvisation and soloing by garcia the transition is seamless but jerry flub some of the lyric in franklin s the jam are extended and this duo is not to be missed estimated is next and it is he highlight of the show bobby sings with passion and both jam are incredible jerry delivers a scorching wah wah solo and the end jam is very soulful before segueing into the bluesy spoonful drum is interesting because it feature hamza el din yet the post space jam is a bit uninspired it seems like they ran out of gas and the remaining tune are average at best the brokedown palace encore is a sweet finish to a mostly great show nassau coliseum on mississippi half step the same thing brown eyed woman el paso candyman when i paint my masterpiece bird song way to go home crazy finger woman are smarter wave to the the wharf rat throwing turn on your love light e box of rain nak d 3 from hey all dead show are worth listening to i wa at this one and the night before and it s striking how mellow and kind of on the lackluster side they are in this anything but mellow new yawk hockey rink however phil s side right next to the speaker this second night they didn t seem nearly a mellow a the night before don t let the date deceive you this wa a cold march in the northeast birdsong is a good one worthy of it position in the set wtgh doesn t disgrace the opener either but we all know what became of that warhorse wave to the wind really isn t played that poorly it wa really hard to follow at the time but they had it together by this point in the tour i also felt it lent itself well to a transition into drum some of the lyric tho eesh pre drum is a little blah but post drum is pretty solid and focused a if they were just starting to wake up the night before i want to mention ha a spareness rare for a two keyboard show this one is a little le so but it also portends how the band settle into a real mellow space with a sparse arrangement for the next several month

55th gen maxells with dolby and underrated show though the song probably peaked in april this good lovin is an absolute monster performance insane energy with jerry and phil carrying the jam to some mesmerizing height killer version of hard to handle especially the second half of the jam after the tape cut which really take off jerry and phil again going at it hard great stuff and a seemingly

you know it isn t i m tempted to go with a 4 on this one but who am i to spoil the 5 star party i know many here are bowled over by the quality maybe to the point that the show is overrated just a tad i mean it s great yeah consistent with that nimble lighter than air 81 quality that defined so many show especially from the winter tour leading up to europe everything is played exceptionally well it s just that that ah hell i don t know shrug i guess maybe a show that seek to use sailor saint a it pre drum core could be accused of being a lightweight even though they play it well enough ah forget

a fan of rehearsal recording but these early 83 session are a lot of fun the recording is real nice and clean and spacious and everyone can be heard clearly the different take of help and slipknot are quite interesting because you can hear the band re learning the tune a they go remembering little lick and trick from six year prior phil is extremely into this session you can tell he s been wanting to get this tune back into heavy rotation for a while and he s finally gotten some cooperation he is all over the place and it s a joy to hear the esau is also fascinating you can hear weir calling out the change a the track progress and you can hear them get a little more together a the minute pas a very worthwhile session for those that are interested and great fun wonderful for fan of the

about show 10 12 for me going back to july 1987 simply stated this cap centre stint wa the best run of show i ever witnessed of any band anywhere anytime the weather wa uncharacteristically warm in the high 70 s and low 80 s and the vibe inside wa almost maniacally intense the band thankfully wa even more intense and even with the mercilessly high expectation of the fan the band wa just killin and just blew away even the most critical deadhead each night the sound from the far side of the arena just a few row off the floor wa the best concert sound i ve ever heard it felt like you could stick out your tongue and lick it after a very fortunate lifetime of seeing over 1 000 concert of all stripe this run is at the peak of them all one of my friend reflecting on these three night described them a splatter oddly i knew what he meant get em all and enjoy another fabulous peak along with 69 72 74 77 and 81 in the storied and legendary career of the greatest live act that ever played on the face of this here planet happy trail and i must say that even though i tend to prefer the earlier day of the band this show doe boil over with energy love the way the crowd erupts with

by charlie miller or check out an audience from the scene at the holiday inn i believe wa really crazy it wa the one right off the akron exit if my memory is correct this wa supposed to be a two day show but the snow caused the first night to be cancelled i think this wa the blizzard of 93 for u ohioan up to 3 foot of snow i remember it took 7 hour to get from marietta oh to akron because we were driving in bad snow we got to the hotel just a they closed all the road when we got to the hotel we already had a room thank god there were so many stranded people there we had like 10 people in our room the hotel smelled really funky too people were all over the hotel and i think the management wa like oh well because the road were closed and no one had anywhere to go the first night wa cancelled and luckily i had ticket to the 2nd night but a lot of people were bummin i remember the day of the show we met this poor guy whose car broke down on the highway we tried really hard to help him fix his car in the snow and freezing cold you know do anything to help a brother we had to push his car with ours off of the highway and left it in town it wa a blue volkswagon the guy really appreciated u trying to help and he turned u on to a really good time thanks man we made it to the show just in time to hang out in the parking lot for about an hour then it wa concert time i think they were having sound issue or our seat were so high up the concert sounded muffled i dont remember much past that except the light and people everywhere i hope that poor guy made it home alright a shout out to all my frinds from then mikey joe ashu and the poor guy with the broke down car miss you guy show wa average and i remember a lot of people complaining about it i had a good time the dead are people to and they must have been having an off night it happens i still love them for what they do and showing me the light in the strangest of place if you look at it right and snowstorm inspires heaven on earth i feel so lucky to have gotten seat to this show after being closed out of the previous night which wa cancelled due to the snowstorm i bet my friend that they would open with because of it who know if that wa the exact reason they did but you could tell the band wa committed to putting on an a 1 performance due to the circumstance a local radio station also broadcast it live a a concession to the fan who missed out jerry s vocal on touch of grey wa among the strongest i ever heard almost like thanking the heaven while proclaiming i will survive

0,sonic bliss my grateful dead story pt 1 sonic bliss pt 1 the beginning of my grateful dead story john mayer once said this of the grateful dead these great band these seminal band they will find you at a time in your life you can’t say you’re not into it you can say you’re not into it yet grateful dead music ha been an omnipresent factor in my life but i never really gave into the music until recently i remember my very first encounter with the dead’s music wa initiated by my best friend in high school he wa a year older than me and i remember sitting in his car a a sophomore and he had just started playing bertha i can’t remember what version i thought it wa a cool song but i wasn’t blown away disclaimer at this point the majority of my music taste at the time consisted of hip hop and rap from the east coast my friend had told me story of his dad who grew up in the bay area during the 60’s and wa a true deadhead ultimately seeing something like 234 show i didn’t understand how anyone could ever see a band that many time but honestly if i could i would have done the same flash forward a few year and i’m in college i took a popular music of the united state course where i learned about the influence popular artist had over the culture of the u s throughout history my appreciation for rock blue psychidelic rock increased exponentially a i spent hour listening to hendrix pink floyd and b b king in a particularly fun lecture my professor had a picture of the dead playing the acid test on a slide ushering in a short lecture on the dead i learned how the dead influenced the 60’s counterculture movement through their psychedelic melody a they played the acid test and haight ashbury i remember my professor played uncle john’s band for the class and he just stood there bobbing to the rhythm his eye closed entranced by the music but shit hit the fan before i really had any time to begin listening to the grateful dead cancer had once again stricken my favorite teacher in high school another deadhead from the 60’s who had always tried to turn me on to grateful dead music he wa more than a psychology teacher to me more like a grandfather i used to go to his class after school had ended and we used to discus philosophy music science psychology etc it wasn’t long before he passed away and i wa devastated i couldn’t see the beauty in the world any more even though i consider myself a person who belief in reincarnation and multiple life i couldn t bear to think that i wa never able to talk to one of my favorite people ever again and then the grateful dead changed my life i wa sitting in my room alone maybe a week after i heard the news i wa scrolling through my music library on my phone to take my mind off of the sadness i wa suppressing when a strange album artwork caught my eye europe 72 i completely forgot i had downloaded it earlier in the year meaning to listen to it when i got the chance i quickly rushed and grabbed my headphone and began the album a soon a cumberland blue came on i felt the sorrow for my teacher’s death fade away slowly a i began smiling and dancing in my room i savored every second of the album like it wa a delicious meal and then morning dew ahh morning dew when jerry’s solo kicked in i felt my eye water a he stirred emotion within me i still can’t explain i closed my eye and it wa in that moment i came to a peaceful resolution with my teacher’s passing i listened to europe 72 three more time that night before i went to bed the weight finally lifted off my shoulder the end of part 1
0,good resource for the logistical technical side of the band’s jam i’m interested in exactly what wa going on onstage when the guy were in the middle of a jam take playin’ in the band for instance in the early 70 era the band would drop into a very minor sounding jam while jerry play with his guitar through a wah pedal this jam could lead to various other song like uncle john etc what particular cue or signal would the band use to navigate this improvisational space or know when to go to the next song were there certain phrase played by jerry hand signal or whenever the band truly dropped into a total improvisation effort who decided where the jam wa ultimately going how much of the jam wa truly rehearsed and how much wa spontaneous how did they communicate to form such effortless transition between rehearsed section and improv section i’m basically looking for any and all resource that talk about this certain aspect of their music i play guitar in a band now and we are starting to be able to transition to and from song pretty smoothly but i would love to broaden our communication while playing and am looking for tip from the master thanks

amazing performance of perhaps dylan s best song that wa the home run like i mentioned that kept you wanting more and kept you rooting for the team and the setlist on the 19th wasn t spectacular but

stop on and we bid you good night soundboard taped by bear owsley mastered and transferred by sirmick from on a crisp evening in a waning winter of 1969 the dead broke like a psychedelic dawn on the river valley town of pittsburgh pennsylvania pouring their intense burning light on a select few sewing the seed of thousand transformed by the light through the year until in 1995 though diminished by time it slipped behind the western mountain leaving smile friendship and musical memory fortunately preserved in recording such a this that crackle with that burning energy and intensity of that first psychedelic dawn fillmore west on green green grass of home saw mill season of my heart china cat i know you rider high time big bos man me my uncle hard to handle cold rain snow uncle john s band black peter good lovin garcia play steel guitar on the first three song this is all that is known to have been played from this show according to deadbase and deadlists though there may be over a half hour of music missing soundboard transferred by don bean from the old town still look the same well the accidental acoustic set in new orleans bares fruit a garcia play pedal steel on the first three track this show open with green grass which is for lack of a better term a ghost tune meaning the song is written from the perspective of a person who ha already died probably the most famous ghost tune the dead played wa el paso because the guy in that song is telling the story after he ha already died so it is with green grass the singer is relating a story from when he wa alive one could argue that the story of both el paso and green grass are from the perspective of someone dying but it seems to me when the tune get sung it make it a done deal by the time the song concludes either way you slice it song like this are loaded with irony when performed by a band called the grateful dead if you want to hear the full uncut sawmill and season refer to the new orleans show a week before worth a listen for sure china rider perhaps a bit speeded up high time wow this tune should have been in the jerry ballad slot in the later year it is so freak in mellow i wa going to give this a 4 because of sound issue but really i wouldn t be caught dead without this so it is another 5 spot big bos man me and my uncle hard to handle cold rain and snow uncle john s band this a nice very laid back u j b the vocal are incredible plus the pacing of the tune is just like a slow dance with just the slightest up tempo i wonder if robert hunter wrote row jimmy watching folk dance to this song also i think it is phil and perhaps pig singing that make the u j b vocal so distinct in 1970 black peter i love this time period for it s very mellow tune good lovin drum good lovin this show is not going to jam you to the outer limit but if you like bear s choice you should really dig on this show perhaps the only big difference is this is not completely acoustic and pigpen is not playing any slow tune here henry j kaiser convention center on hey pocky way jack straw loser walkin blue a little light standing on the moon memphis blue bird song iko iko victim or the crime we can

like this in 1st set this tune in fine line of hunter garcia ballad memphis blue they overplayed this song if only considering just the tune the dead dylan played summer of 87 and never broke out after that tour nice space moment before memphis brent ha got the organ going on jerry singing backup for weir bobby sings w o nasal whine make it better tune bird song sweet end of set choice you

0,today of the dead 2 9 ah mother american night i m lost from the light roscoe maple pavilion stanford university on promised land row jimmy black throated wind deal me my uncle sugaree look like rain loose lucy mexicali blue brown eyed woman el paso here come sunshine playin in the band china cat i know you rider jack straw they love each other eye of the china doll big river ramble on rose box of rain wave that flag sugar magnolia uncle john s band around around e casey jones soundboard digitally remastered using a custom built dual daw nicknamed bertha by on september 3 2002 the many fade were done previously by others from can t go wrong with a 73 show great jazzy jam especially playin and eye solid performance throughout some of the harmony are a little wonky it s almost redundant to name hcs here but overall not too bad actually donna nail row jimmy quite beautifully i came to the realization while listening to this show that i actually prefer the lyric to wave the flag over u blue and greatest big river ever in addition to all of the awesome and well deserved accolade for this landmark show there’s one unsung gem the best big river in spite of itself during an interview in the late 80 jerry wa asked if there were any song he wa really sick of playing if i never had to play big river again i d be ok with that well behold the best version they ever did even if they miss the ending and take it around to the chorus an extra time this is a barnburner and a supreme highpoint from jerry’s alligator strat era and oh the tone through that wall of sound prior to the delivery of doug irwin’s wolf guitar a couple of month later likewise bobby s counter rhythm wa never better either and audible quirk and all this is a great representation of a great show a it wa a tremendous honor to be a participant it is a tremendous honor to participate just one more time six new song advertised a all new stuff and an all new p a system hence the working out the bug of the wall of sound to compensate the boy and girl play their heart out if it were available this show would merit a 10 rating if for nothing else than historical splendor on a dark and windblown rainy friday night at stanford s new gym the first and final gd concert at this venue bill graham had to pay to have the floor re done for all the burn hole and the gd were never asked back by the university or requested to return by bgp too bad really this wa a perfect venue for the gd it wa much more sonically appealing than winterland and much more accessible if you were arriving from afar and if you were there that night you exited more than 80 mile high nun the le soldier and sailor memorial hall on promised land candyman cassidy tennessee jed el paso jack a roe look like rain stagger lee passenger china cat i know you rider not fade i need a good lovin from the heart of me he s come a around around e shakedown street audience recording 3 nak cm 300 s from despite the sound s remoteness this is a very good show from winter 79 1st set promised nicely explodes upon landing it s a quick and darting performance jerry welcome u with a candyman that s awfully marred by the terrible muted sound quality cassidy is a ripsnorter tennessee jed is nicely harmonized but is stifled by a sluggish pace tho jerry doe hit some nice note when it count e paso is passionately read by bobby jack sound about the same a it did last night but is a tad snappier and a tad le flavorful llr fill out the power ballad slot nicely a well a thematically fitting after the hard won love affair of jack the intent is there for stagger but they have got to pick up it pace passenger is high energy if not particularly distinctive one of the first china rider s since it winterland 12 29 77 is well received tho never take off til the later whose dynamite is not fully appreciated by this yucky tape 2nd set nice change of pace opening with a nfa random excursion lead to a nice slide and lead interplay at 5 45 through 6 30 jerry then take off on his own magical journey til we reconvene to sing a haunting outro thing get quiet and then boom miracle time crowd certainly appreciating the silence to over the top rock n roll bertha continues the good time with an agreeable if not standout version good lovin raise the stake yet again and now i m pissed that this tape is providing only half the requisite sound quality needed to fully enjoy this impressive set from the heart of me doe what s necessary and provide a moment to chill rumble me gently let s sway to a soothing he s gone it s patient comforting and well told jerry remains on stage with the drummer for an extended noodling session that s not distancing because of the hearty meal being presented to u by the band this evening drum space pas the test which sail into a truckin that s decent but carry with it a little le energy a little more mellow than the song pre drum come a time is a beautiful choice a something with the neglectful mourning black peter or wharf rat around and around concludes matter on a righteous note building u all into a slightly uncontained frenzy let s continue the party by throwing kc a decent shakedown encore if it wasn t for this shoddy tape this would be a 4 star experience a it is it s a 3 1 2 rated downward for an honest appraisel of the sound henry j kaiser convention center on jack straw they love each other cc rider loser woman are deal the mighty samson delilah he s smokestack come a the other around good lovin e it s all over now baby blue chinese new year chinese symphony orchestra opened sbd cassette master sony d5 dolby b tdk ma r90 taped by paul scotton and joani walker transferred by charlie miller from chinese new year 1986 i m surprised no one ha written a review of this show yet i went to both chinese new year show in 1986 this night and the night before it both were incredible bay area show before each of the two chinese new year show a chinese band opened the show the chinese band wa playing already when we first came into the venue they were playing chinese music during drum i made my way down to the main floor after an incredible he s gone smokestack followed by come a time shortly after i arrived on the main floor space began a few minute later something very unusual happened the crowd started to cheer it is not unusual for the crowd at a dead show to cheer suddenly but this wa in the middle of space and it wa a sustained cheering long before the band wa ready to come out of space so i knew it wasn t just because people had heard the first few note of what the band would be going into out of space there wa something else about the way the crowd wa cheering it continued for a while and became progressively louder then i noticed that the people on the main floor with me were starting to turn around and look toward the back of the venue i looked up into the seating area on the side of the venue and they were all looking toward the back of the venue too i turned around and couldn t believe my eye weaving it way through the main floor only a short distance away from where i stood wa a giant brightly colored chinese dragon it wa writhing and swaying and a few time it blew real flame from it nostril i wa standing just behind the soundboard on the phil side of the room and it wa headed right for me a it got closer i could see that it wa supported by several people who were controlling the motion of the giant dragon with stick that they were using to make it look like the dragon wa moving on it own it took about 6 or 7 people to control it a they came closer and made their way right past me so close that i could touch them i saw who it wa it wa the chinese band that had opened the show they were controlling this huge fire breathing dragon that had emerged from the back of the venue during space and wa winding it way toward the stage if you listen to recording of this show you can hear the crowd s reaction during space the cheering might be more noticeable on audience recording of the show the dragon wove it way through the dense crowd up one side of the stage across the stage with the band still playing space and then it exited through the back of the stage never to be seen again shortly after that the dead went into one of the coolest other one i ve ever heard in my life which didn t have the characteristic intro that the other one usually ha it had a more subtle almost spooky lead in and it wa not nearly a obvious at the time what they were going into i ve searched the internet long and hard for any photo that anyone might have of that dragon but i have found nothing it wa one of the coolest and most unexpected thing that i have ever seen happen at a dead show oh i m drowning in you

0,today of the dead 2 11 in the backwash of fennario the black and bloody mire fillmore east on the other one cryptical envelopment dire wolf casey jones late show not fade away cumberland blue cold rain snow high time me my uncle dark star spanish jam turn on your love light e uncle john s band taped by pat lee and don wolfe transferred by matt smith this is a complete remaster by matt using his new set up this wa done using a different transfer chain this method wa per the advise of dan healy i received from him a while back in trying to attain a perfectly clean signal going to digital i had one of my reel machine modded for a direct tape head output going into a custom bottlehead tape tube pre specifically built for reel transfer w 2 diff eq setting for tape speed so basically you have a perfectly clean tape signal going into the tube pre going into 24 96 digital from this wa the era of two show per night only a partial set exists from the first show black jones this list is known from personal memory and the sbd fragment and outrageous show everybody remembers different stuff from the past a a musician i can t see how it would be possible to have split show of the kind described in contradiction to bear stanley it would be so much of an organizational nightmare a to be a needle pointless headache that you could not pay roadies enough to deal with roadies remember have to eat sleep fuck get stoned and otherwise have a good time and generally do thing other than spending all their time setting up and tearing down and neither bill graham nor god himself could have herded cat to that extent the split show theory sound like canonical history fodder that everybody say is empirically verified even though they ve never seen any verification never felt what it wa like to have to put on a show kiel auditorium on promised land sugaree mama mexicali blue friend of the devil lazy supplication might a well the music never stopped samson delilah china cat i know

1970 we would call this a vg audience tape while there minimal high end and the drum are hard to hear weir lesh garcia are all there and easy to follow plus this a steady tape with minimal audience interference and this tape sound every bit of it 26 year even though the show is decent avoid this recording besides you ll find better 2 9 10 1st set promised is loose and carefree despite sloppy playing and bobby s oft forgetting of the lyrcis evidently they re trying but sugaree sound tired and messy frankly this cloudy recording isn t helping matter mama is short speedy and harmless mexicali is well played but undistinctive fotd accurately conveys the tone of this man s lamentable situation our first lazy supplication in a week is fine but this dull recording is really beginning to frustrate me it s tough to manufacture enthusiasm when the sound is this stunted yet supp build to tense if not exploding climax my goodness let the fresh rich overflow with a bright perky might a well this version s a real success to keep the set flowing no time for anything solemn or maudlin lesh s thick groove announce a highly musical if not mind bending music 2nd set feel the percussive movement let the foot stomping begin because it s time for a bobby sunday school lesson sampson is nice but due to the thin quality of this sound it s yucky it s not really overly enjoyable the same could be said for the china rider that follows the rider is especially tense but due to the remoteness of the sound the quality of the playing is difficult to ascertain from is standard and predictable a ship would have made a better choice terrapin is a pleasure but doe not deviate from the norm playing is a predictable but generous selection the jam is nice wow i am so disinterested in reviewing the rest of this show suffice to say the playing is fine equivalent to good ol gd but nothing astounding the encore is missing from this tape but to all those venture into these murky warning it is at your discretion henry j kaiser convention center on china cat i know you rider minglewood blue dupree s diamond blue me my mexicali blue bird the music never might a well iko eye of the stella not fade e not fade hey bo goin down the road feelin bad matrix by hunter seamons iko eye of the drum not fade hey bo diddley with member of the nevelle brother from loved it then still do nice thing about this website is we get to relive those year of life anytime we want is like on demand on tv these day i wa just to the right of jerry in the very last entrance to the hallway anyone who ha been to the kaiser s know the spot in the year past it wa the way up to the bar eventually they moved the bar to the basement anyway we were in the middle of the rhythm devil parade wow that wa intense knew our placement wa in the way but it is where we all hung out back then a they made there way to the stage we knew it would be aiko but with a twist neville brother sure loved playing with the boy in the middle of aiko can hear either billy or mickey screaming aiko a they jammed along it sound to me like they never told each other what they were to play ha one of those moment to it where they sound like they want to go into something else but just stick with a prolnged aiko then came eye s and i know i wa surprised rest of the show is just a fun lot of improv and jamming going anywhere they want it to now that s good ole grateful dead to me 5 star because they are the best and the sound ha it too great western la forum on mississippi half step minglewood blue candyman big river built to last queen jane approximately we can run but we can t hide bird song china cat i know you rider woman are smarter standing on the moon estimated i will take you eye of the i need a black turn on your love light e box of rain from i loved this performance and the soud quality is outstanding the show the night before wa good but this is even better now off to listen to the third night of this l a run and a long but worthy gig from the city of angel i prefer this sound to the static y sheath in front of the speaker noise on the other recording 1st set after a minute of tuning a comfortable somewhat rousing stroll through mississippi the forum filly are looking good throughout an eager perfectly acceptable minglewood up next is an easy to follow seemingly abbreviated 6 minute candyman a focused direct big river is next we have a debut jerry s 89 version of push the title track built to last even though this is it first public offering it sound none too different than any other version a professional queen jane follows that s accenuated by pretty jerry line and a keen charge at the end an impassioned sung we can run is notable for it brevity let s sing and clap along at the top of the 4 s the bird fly by next pretty standard despite some odd purposefully anti gelling jamming mid way through only average climax making me believe they should have closed the set off with promised 2nd set on the bright side china get u back to dancing i can t say the presentation wa particularly novel but a good time wa had a consistently rigorous rider maintains momentum it move real quickly but doesn t pave new road man smart follows the same pattern tight and focused with plenty of energy but not much invention a minimalist standing confirms that this song ha matured fast unfortunately by eliminating all musical momentum the first two three minute of estimated lack that special craze there must have been an agreement made between band member to purposely stretch out the song before drum into a jamming vehicle however at around the ten minute mark estimated begin it dissolution into space like brain fart ooopsy my mistake because around 13 30 the tone get awfully kiddy leading to brent s lullabye take you home someone s strumming a well placed acoustic sounding guitar finally it s drum time which includes some lovely lady chanting in a foreign dialect around 8 30 on for a minute it sound a if they re documenting the burning of a vietnamese village with the men pleading for god to intervene after a short space a barebones eye emerges consider a ride through farmland country sort of bumbling character apple dumpling gang made introspective very fine 2 1 2 minute outro jazzy groovin thang now completely changing tone cause we re in la a miracle after a minute of altering sensibility jerry and company make ado bobby s sings the tune in an odd but sincere timewarp find her in a sideshow leave her errgh right here next the sad tale of black peter which is musically like eye in that it s minimal and reach it pinnacle in it outro good time through a consistent lovelite digging brent s swirling board not bobby s cheesy vocal presentation this is an appropriate location for box nice all around work from phil weak harmonizing thank you goodnight phil 3 1 4 star the dire wolf collect his due while the boy sing round the

0,i ve recently realized that i have grown into loving grate music in parallel to john music is a funny thing when i wa younger i listened to simple thing that made me feel good john mayer s effortless love song fell right into that category now a i ve gotten older and fallen in love with the dead and other similar sound almost at the exact same time a john it ha given me a whole new perspective on the evolution of taste and interest just a many of u have heard and seen in the evolution of johnny checker maybe this is why i have accepted him into the dead so easily i just wanted to share this thought and wa wondering if other millennials have had similar thought about this awesome band and the young guy that ha come in and given it a breath of fresh air

0,searching for barn burner akin to the hard to handle casey jones lovelight from 8 6 71 i m might ramble a bit so i ll put my concrete question for you guy in bold towards the bottom of the post i should preface by saying that i ve been a totally converted deadhead since i wa introduced 3 year ago i thought i had a pretty good grasp of the band and their history i considered myself primarily a 77 guy but i also really dug 89 and mid 70 s stuff a couple day ago i discovered the relisten app took two tab and listened to 08 06 71 the epic rob bertrando aud 02 18 71 sbd and part of 06 24 71 ken judy lee aud for the first time halfway through the 08 06 71 show the drum wa so fucking good and i m not much of a drum fan that i had to lay down and when phil launched into the other one i immediately knew this wa the greatest show i d ever heard in fact it wa bar none the greatest musical experience discovery of my life and over the past few day this feeling of awe and excitement hasn t diminished a bit here i had been listening to the dead pretty much nonstop for a couple year and wa still able to discover show that not only became my favorite show but reinvented my entire concept of the grateful dead furthermore this came at a perfect time because this semester i m starting up a band with my deadhead guitarist friend and we re trying to put a set list together of high energy song for house show a you can imagine with this context 70 71 wa epiphanous 70 71 dead sound like house show dead in a good way high energy clean playing wild jamming amazing stage presence great crowd i m going to try to explain what i liked most about these show and if you guy have any recommendation for show to check out good article about this time period or even other group to look into based on what i like that would be awesome here are some song that i m looking for high energy version of i am using headyversion of course but i find that sometimes headyversion is so biased towards particular release that a lot slip through the crack cumberland blue saint stephen hard to handle holy shit this is a good song that i had no idea about turn on your lovelight casey jones st stephen is if played right almost guaranteed to be a banger cumberland blue ha very fun vocal and ha a very easy yet wild minor jam section that would be awesome to play viola lee blue ha a similar gminor jam hard to handle and lovelight are great because of all the cool different jam that jerry and bob make groovy jam really funky i love it when the dead get funky lovelight especially seems to go through four or five distinct phase with different main riff those two song make you move your butt and that s a big plus not to mention that unlike railroad or cumberland mine the topic of sex doesn t age everyone especially jerry and the drum imo is tight much tighter than even 77 that musical tightness bootie shakin funk driving energy is what i need with this in mind what are your favorite high energy version of the song i listed or song you think i d like based on my reasoning what are good full show from this era to check out bonus point if there are any other killer aud s i love a good aud miscellaneous 1 if any of you are musician that have advice for learning this material that would be awesome 2 if you guy know of any good article book review from this period that you recommend let me know about those too thanks guy

term deadhead that ticket price for the upcoming bobby and phil reunion show are beyond reach for loyal fan the grateful dead organization today announced a novel program that will allow financially strapped fan to obtain ticket starting january 1 would be concert goer can apply for ticket using time and effort instead of cash the arrangement is simple the band member and associated staff have compiled a list of to do item and applicant who can accomplish task and check item off the list will receive ticket in compensation band member phil lesh and bob weir announced the new program today at a press conference held at lesh’s music venue and restaurant terrapin crossroad in san rafael said guitarist bob weir of the task for ticket program you know i’ve heard people say that they gave up their best year to follow u and now they feel abandoned well i know the feeling i spent my twenty thirty and forty in the back of a goddamn rental van shuttling between holiday inn and shit hole like hampton fucking coliseum then when i finally got back to marin i’d be told that after venue fee insurance travel and payroll and expense for what seemed like way too many hippy that i guess were our employee i had like eight hundred buck so then we had to leave and do the whole wretched thing over again lesh added yeah that’s right so when my buddy jerry you may remember him died trying to keep that shit show rolling we kinda said to ourselves oh fuck what did we do ’ i mean we really pissed in the cheerio killing that guy so we took a break and laid off all those hippy we kept some of the bikers around though i mean they work their ass off and are pretty self sufficient none of them ever even asked for healthcare and they beat the shit out of union guy just for fun but i digress so eventually bobby and i we hired real professional to handle our financial matter we both wrote a bunch of song and we still get royalty also we are pretty much sober so we are able to kind of be productive we made some money finally and bobby bought sweetwater music hall and i built terrapin crossroad we were feeling pretty good about the whole thing after all bobby saved this really historic old venue and i preserved an old building and we created a lot of job and were able to continue playing music for people and all this stuff funny thing though is people were mad at u one guy said something on facebook about wanting to burn my place down because i wa charging sixty buck for ticket they also called bobby an elitist because mill valley wouldn’t let people camp out in fucking micro bus and let their rabid dog roam the street biting child and impregnating show bred shih tzus so finally we just said fuck it’ and did this whole soldier field thing well that shit wa popular and then people started acting even more crazy they were mad a hell and saying stupid shit all over the internet like criticizing bobby for sending his girl to private school and stuff the promoter and the venue saw what wa up before we did and man they were on it like ticket were hard to get and they cost a shitload but whatever it’s 2017 and there are still a lot of mouth to feed anyhow all this negativity and i just wasn’t going to play anymore i bought a 700 000 porsche and a boat and some other shit and man having nice stuff is expensive i mean that boat cost me money just sitting there i gotta get guy to put on scuba gear and scrape barnacle i gotta insure it i gotta pay for the slip or whatever they call it and all this other stuff so anyhoo we made a damn fortune on the dead50 deal and then weir hook up with that mayer dude and they’re making even more scratch plus mayer can still bring in groupie who are in their late teen i’m real happy hanging at my club and playing most of the time but man i gotta get a piece of all this popularity i’m gonna make some damn money and weir is right there with me i think weir chime in with his famous googly eye and a sneer you bet your as i am i didn’t fucking tell anyone to spend their youth running all over the goddamn world watching u play our music you think when we were kid we just fucked off fuck no we played wrote music played wrote music made record played and played some more we were fucking focused and serious and worked like madman and while we weren t doing that we were working to move society forward maybe a little bit we had a work ethic and an ethos we didn t spend our time bitching about what we were owed or what we couldn t get if you didn’t go to school or bother to learn a trade because you were too busy walking around the parking lot at alpine valley with your index finger in the air like some kind of dickhead well that’s not my problem you want to go to the show you can hand polish my new italian marble step at my mansion in kentfield but i am sure a shit going to blindfold you on the way there neo hippie bullshit motherfucker the program is expected to be extremely

0,just started reading no simple highway by peter richardson not too far along yet but really enjoying it so far there s a paragraph on page 73 that resonates with me fear also figured in garcia s attraction to psychedelics one anthropologist noted that most of the commentary on the grateful dead ha lacked a sufficient consideration of fear and it wa no accident that many early listener cited terror a their first reaction to the dead s music several frightening aspect of the psychedelic experience including the dissolution or fluidity of ego boundary contributed to that effect the antique danse macabre iconography also expressed a basic fascination with the darker side of life that lay behind the band s name in this sense skeleton with rose weren t adornment but rather central element in the dead s project and it s reception i love the sunshine and rainbow but it the other darker more raw feeling experience that the music and culture invokes that originally appealed to me what are everyone else s thought what are your experience with fear and other emotion besides joy and happiness a it relates to the dead or dead culture

0,what is your favorite dead year currently and why see title currently i ve been on a 72 kick and i m of the opinion that this is the peak dead year a much a i love 73 74 77 and 87 90 i think 72 is undoubtedly home to their best jam every single show i ve heard is dripping with lysergic power the entire band is in straight shaman mode and the sound is still clean and pure i feel a though every year after this is somewhat more corrupted not the best word to describe it by the influence of hard drug and alcohol in 72 the raw spiritual power reign supreme though there wa obviously still some other thing involved but the flow of the music ha yet to be redirected by addiction im not sure if i m explaining this well but i m doing my best lol basically i feel a though the band is more focused than any other year they re still scouting uncharted territory and taking thing a deep a possible perhaps too deep at time i feel like 72 crossed a lot of line that shouldnt be crossed and a a result they had to dial back the psychedelia substantially afterward gradually becoming more of a good time band a opposed to a horrifyingly intense spiritual awakening type band although it always been a little bit of both and i sometimes prefer their later sound a well i just believe that in 72 they were still searching in every show and kind of found what they were looking for to a certain extent doe that make sense what do you guy think list your favorite s and explain

0,dead and co show dilemma my friend and i bought ticket for the show sunday at madison square garden and it wa 180 each for the seat just below the nosebleed sometime after my friend’s dad got him two more free ticket after we already bought them so he invited two more of our friend to go turn out these free ticket are ga and neither me or my friend ha ever been even close to that at a dead show i guess my question is whether it’s a dick move to use the ga ticket for me and my friend who paid money and have our other friend sit in the seat we bought rather than all enjoy the concert together in the seat we bought we’d trade the two ga ticket with two people sitting in that section

0,my thought on 11 9 17 the tour is of to a great start i wa really excited i had just gotten home from a shitty day at work and it feel great to just kick back and watch the livestream the atmosphere of the concert didn t feel right i know it s a great cause it just feel weird to have the dead and metallica back to back like i could even tell on the camera that it just didn t feel right that being said the show felt more commercial like they played the crowd pleaser not a bad thing just something i noticed i thought deal wa fantastic one of their best i love the long deal and how the song ha become somewhat of a staple of their show again do in fact let that deal go down i never get tired of hearing it not fade away wa also really tight and wa just about perfect i wa digging mayer tone on it scarlet fire wa pretty good i don t know how i feel yet about oteil singing more song yet i find it awesome that you never know who s going to exactly sing what however to be honest i don t like john s falsetto and i really wish they d hire another backup singer i know you guy mostly don t like donna but i feel like she add something that isn t there yet in dead co and i m not saying necessarily get her but get someone to fill the role touch of grey not much to say about it it wa ok and lastly playing in the band i felt like it wa really cluttered and should of been more of a drawn out jam they did however have time constraint and most likely were just trying to get through the set list i really liked the experimentation this show and i hope it continues again with different singer along with a a guitar guy i d love to see a diversity of guitar john love his pr and bobby love his start but it would be cool to hear different sound i also noticed the drummer were amped up more experimenting this show which wa really awesome a a young 17 yr old deadhead dead co is the closest i have to seeing the real thing and i ve seen them twice and will always cherish it i love the dead with all my heart and really hope they tour forever now for the real question were the guy on something but no really what did you guy think let me know

0,thought on 11 12 17 msg tour opener wa sitting in section 101 midway up and here are some quick thought comment reaction to last night opening effort i thought that the mix wa generally better than most of last summer’s show the soundboard is now confirming it i think the board turned the drum down a little bit and evened them out in the mix from previous tour some of mickey’s slap and fill are blended a little better jeff could use turning up a always but i thought john oteil bobby were nicely represented i think the one exception wa a bit of squeaking from bobby on his part in china cat could have used an adjustment on that one notable bust out greatest story ever told niceeeeee bob sounded fantastic on this i think the run from set break through drum wa the highlight of the night ship of fool terrapin ship of fool wa a particular treat with some nice layering in of oteil on the vocal this song for me wa the evening’s highlight some weird flow to the post space song a killer sotm but just a little choppy and an odd placement of too a an isolated song rather than a jam vehicle seems like sotm and too flipped position at set break generally i thought that the show had a lot of great individual song effort but fell a little short a a whole show some tough miscue notable including the start to cumberland transition from space to sotm some vocal jam at the end of shakedown and they love each other perhaps from a lack of practice or difficulty hearing hard to tell gotta give the boy a pas though a this wa their first outing of the tour i think they need a monday morning qb mindset and get back to it on tuesday not the best i’ve seen heard from them looking forward to tuesday

0,any song you like a version more than a classic gd version sooo i wa already sort of having the feeling lately that i enjoy the way they do the other one and estimated i like the way johnny checker sort of shred all over the other one and i like the synth that jeff play they sort of take it to the next level with estimated i know jerry ha crushed estimated many time before but i really do like johnny playing on it i think bobby voice sound better now on some song than it used to he also us those delay effect which are fuckin awesome he change the spacing of the vocal phrasing which really grew on me and i just love the sound and tightness of the band on these song in general the version i wa listening to were from 6 9 17 although they did just play both song at msg separate night i believe but i haven t listened to those again although the estimated wa def a good one after going to both concert i started thinking a little more i really really liked the 11 14 version of tennessee jed and st stephen like i m talking love here lady and gentleman i loved those version so what do we say are there any version that may be just may be superior or is that just sacrilege

0,nugs mobile app question hi folk happy fall tour and boy is it off to a fantastic start so i subscribed to the app again on iphone and i just seem to find the experience le than satisfying even with gapless playback selected song downloaded for offline listening or song sequentially queued still have a very noticeable gap between song which really ruin moment where they flow well china rider etc etc anyone else experiencing this my other question is for those who have subscribed to the hi fi cd quality package wa it worth it when i listen to the nugs stream on youtube the sound quality is great the mixing seems really well done and i can accurately hear each member s contribution the standard playback package which i have through nugs just seems so bad compared to what i m hearing via the stream the mixing seems a bit off and the sound stage feel distant like i m not actually sitting there experiencing the music live i feel like i have to turn my speaker up considerably to get the same experience i get listening to old dead show through spotify is this corrected with the cd quality package cheer
0,dead and company phully 11 16 17 game continues we are back to play the game for tonight in philly a rule refresher please guess the opener closer and encore s for tonight s how remember a few thing you will need both song if there is a double encore and you must indicate if they segued into each other or did not you do not have to do this for the opener and closer also any submission after tuning will not be valid nor will answer that have been edited during the show reddit gold is the prize for getting all 3 my guess tonight opener dancing in the street closer morning dew encore liberty johnny b goode good luck and someone win already also i am thinking of changing the formula if no one win today my proposed idea is to allow everyone to not only pick the opener closer encore but also pick the 1st set closer 2nd set opener a well a a bonus song and if you can get three correctly plus the bonus you win thought the bonus is a song that is played but set placement doe not matter whatsoever result opener dancing in the street closer goin down the road feelin bad encore black muddy river no one got it sticking with old formula for now in boston hope you guy keep playing if it get dead ill just stop lol good luck to all

0,come a time when you really geek out good day fellow head i wanted to share with you all a project i have been working on first a quick back story i bought the get shown the light box set earlier this year one gem for me wa the buffalo show from 5 9 77 i had never really listened to it before it is really great just a good if not better than cornell in my opinion anyway while listening to this show one thing that stood out to me wa the come a time it wa hypnotizing and so full of emotion then a few month later dead and co bust out come a time with otiel slaying it btw and it triggered my fascination with the tune again fast forward a couple month this song is still bouncing around in my subconscious i had a thought that this wa one of jerry s finest tune i wondered if there were any version better than the one buffalo from 77 that curiosity led me to wonder how many time c a t wa played i found that number online there were 65 of them performed by the dead then a few day later i had another thought i could listen to them all take note along the way and find the ultimate version so that s what i did over the course of a month i listened to every version of come a time it wa a fascinating journey it started in minneapolis in 71 and traveled through space and time to landover in 94 i experienced an uncommon journey after finishing all the version looking over my note and chatting with a friend about it i decided to write a blog about the project it is at over the next few month i m going to share some of my thought observation and note through a series of blog post so if you dig the project and would like to read about some of the thing i discovered please check the blog i m going to attempt to add a new post every week

0,a short history of csny the grateful dead and the music they created together complete with link to interview studio collaboration and live recording the history in the summer of 1969 stephen still lived for the most part on mickey hart’s ranch both had a love for horse and still acquired a thoroughbred racehorse for hart of course this wa the year that crosby still nash had begun to materialize and so david crosby naturally showed up at the ranch regularly musical bond formed quickly and on december 10 at the thelma theatre still joined the band in the second set debuting the louisianan country blue song black queen and playing on multiple others by the end of that year still told that he had promised the grateful dead that when he finished recording déjà vu with crosby graham nash and the recently acquired neil young he would help them make a record since a crosby agreed they aren’t very good at it ultimately jerry garcia also helped csny on déjà vu a graham nash recalled in his memoir wild tale dead and the airplane were also at heider’s but in adjacent studio working on new stuff i didn’t know jerry garcia too well although i knew he wa a fine musician so crosby suggested i approach him about playing on teach your child i’d heard jerry had just started playing pedal steel guitar and asked if he would add a pedal track to my song after the first take i said thanks jerry you’re done ’ no ’ he protested i fucked up that part when we go right into the chorus can i do another ’ do it ’ i told him but i’m never going to use it the first one wa exactly what i wanted ’ of course his pedal steel wa one of the defining element in that recording teach your child and the time spent at wally heider’s recording studio helped kick off a period of close musical and personal relationship between various member of the two band jerry garcia would go on to play pedal steel on 5 more song across 4 album by crosby still and nash in their solo and duo venture a you all know in 1970 the grateful dead released workingman’s dead and american beauty the harmony thanks in part to the help of crosby still nash are some of the most defining aspect of both album when asked about what influenced such a radical change from the sound of the anthem bob weir simply relied crosby still nash later in the same interview weir wa asked how they achieved the lush harmony on their americana album and he expanded on his earlier remark crosby still nash had u way beat at that we called it stacking back then you record a chorus the eagle were famous for it i don’t know how many track of ooos’ back there but y’know they turned themselves into a choir we probably did it once and then two more time phil lesh added everybody double and they sing their part two or three time giving some song with three part harmony nine vocal track following csny’s fantastic 1970 summer tour go check out the june fillmore show or 4 way street the band broke up in a firestorm after still and young had been chasing rita coolidge for some time nash swept in still fury wa captured in crosby’s cowboy movie in which four men return from a train robbery to enjoy the spoil only to find an indian girl standing all alone still is personified in the story a eli the outlaws’ fastest gunner who is kind of mean and young from the south young a the duke and nash a billy eli and the duke they got down to it each wanted the indian girl for their own when they finally got around to asking her know she said she d come to take young billy home said he d kill young billy kill the duke and probably me too yeah after stills’ outburst the band dissolved for a time stills’ remained close with hart and garcia who played pedal steel on stills’ jesus gave love away for free and change partner in the period following the band’s breakup the four member focused their time on what would become four acclaimed solo album each recorded in the spirit of laurel canyon at the time the folk based l a music scene wa a tight night musical community from 1968 to 1975 musician from l a would often have many of their friend and peer play many time on instrument they were not known for on their album instead of studio musician joni mitchell’s album blue featured stephen still on bass james taylor both played banjo and sung harmony with linda ronstadt on neil young’s song old man and on crosby’s music is love graham nash played guitar and sang while young sang and played guitar bass vibraphone and conga many great collaboration sprang out of this community and it eventually leaked into neighbouring music scene crosby’s experimental side mixed well with the bay area scene’s acid infused psychedelic rock in the day of the byrd he had hung out with the jefferson airplane quite regularly but the real musical melting pot began in 1970 when paul kanter of the airplane set out to record blow against the empire he not only recruited member from the dead but crosby nash a well a they were all neighbour at wally heider’s studio out of this the planet earth rock and roll orchestra wa born a term coined by paul kanter to describe this new merger of the la and san francisco bay area music scene that had it root at heider’s studio shortly thereafter crosby and nash delivered if only i could remember my name and song for beginner respectively both album were perro project to different degree nash’s debut solo album wa rooted more in his pop infused folk and featured phil lesh bill kreutzmann and jerry garcia among a large list of well known musician of the time the contribution on nash’s album all bear the mark of the musician who played on it but crosby’s album wa created a he said on the edge if only i could remember my name heavily featured member the member of perro with other addition a well only pigpen and bob weir did not appear on crosby’s record weir s absence could perhaps be explained by crosby wa living in mill valley and bobby weir lived in mill valley they were trying to rehearse and i would go over and drag along my stratocaster and cause trouble i would go in and they would be trying to record even and i would cause trouble i would go in and say ah you guy don t have a real rhythm guitar player ’ laugh which endeared me to bob forever i m sure nonetheless every grateful dead member save for weir and pigpen played on crosby’s record a great deal and contributed heavily to the overall sound i don’t need to preach about how good crosby and nash s first solo album are just go listen to them following the perro era the relationship between crosby still nash and the grateful dead remained close phil jerry and bill all played on graham nash david crosby in 1974 finally finishing one of the perro era s greatest song crosby and still appeared on stage with the dead many time and phil teamed up with crosby nash in the 90 and 2000s for live collaboration the respect csny and the grateful dead had for eachother is visible in how many time their musical path crossed since 1969 but david crosby s remark in 1970 sum it up think jerry garcia probably need me like he need a third eye excuse me a fourth he ha a third but i would be just so knocked out to play or sing or do any kind of music with that dude i mean you know i would hey and he s not the only one what about lesh man have you really considered what kind of a musician phil lesh is i would like to make a record sometime with him playing classical music on an electric bass he is certainly one of the most virtuoso string instrument player on the planet somewhere sooner or later ha got to realize that the grateful dead is one of the best band in the world and i hope that it s more than just the people who occasionally see them do a really stupendous set but they re man on a good night the dead is a good a it get period i mean they can take people and make em just absolutely fucking boogie till dawn and there s very little of that around the song

0,story behind the europe 72 album cover so i recently acquired a vinyl copy of europe 72 and the album cover got me thinking the square on the ice cream kid s shirt are exactly 1 4 x 1 4 which happens to be the size of a standard tab of acid on the other side the same pattern is on the sock which is also visible through the hole in the shoe is this a reference to the band smuggling lsd into europe for that tour in someone s sock or hidden in the false bottom of a shoe i ve read most of the book about the band and have never seen this one explained

0,question about july 1978 i always thought july 78 were fantastic show but something wa different i noticed that the dead seem to be not using any distortion or wah effect fire on the mountain is mostly slide and clean guitar with no wah and jerry just seemed to possibly use an octave pedal for about a minute in the song the other one us a lot of crescendo with keith to build the song with out distortion estimated profit is the only one that seems to have a wah used but there sound is super clean with bob occasionally using some chorus show date 7 1 78 7 3 78 7 5 78 7 7 78 7 8 78 i am wondering if any one know why the band wa wa not using the effect normally used during these show

0,music critic pierro scaruffi on the dead the grateful dead considered by many a the greatest rock band of all time were a monument of san francisco s hippy civilization and in general a monument of the psychedelic civilization of the 1960s their greatest invention wa the lengthy free form group jam the rock equivalent of jazz improvisation unlike jazz in which the jam channelled the angst of the afro american people grateful dead s jam wa the soundtrack for lsd trip but soon it came to represent an entire ideology of evasion from the establishment of artistic freedom of alternative lifestyle contrary to their image of junky and misfit the grateful dead were one of the most erudite group of all time aware of the atonal composition of the european avantgarde a well of the modal improvisation of free jazz a well a the rhythm of other culture they managed to transform guitar feedback and odd meter into the rock equivalent of chamber instrument the infinite ascending and descending scale of jerry garcia are among the most titanic enterprise ever attempted by rock music the grateful dead never sold many record their preferred format wa the live concert not the record they literally redefined what popular music is the live concert shunned the law of capitalism removing the business plan from entertainment their recorded masterpiece anthem for the sun 1968 aoxomoxoa 1969 and live dead 1970 are mere approximation of their art at the same time though their free form jam were born out of a philosophy that wa still profoundly american they were born at the border between the individualistic and libertarian culture of the frontier and the communal and spiritual culture of the quaker despite being ostracized by the establishment the grateful dead expressed better than any other musician of that age the quintessence of the american nation and perhaps that wa precisely the reason that their music resonated so well with the soul of the american youth it is not a coincidence that the grateful dead along with the byrd and bob dylan led the movement towards country rock via workingman s dead 1970 and jerry garcia s solo album garcia 1972 the band spent their adult year trying to transform the subcultural idiom of the hippy into a universal language that could reach out to every corner of the planet not only the hippy commune they succeeded with a form of intellectual muzak which interpreted the lysergic trip a a cathartic escape from daily reality and liberation from urban neurosis weather report suite 1975 blue for allah 1975 terrapin station 1977 althea 1979 in practice their art wa a psychological research on the relationship between the altered state of the mind psychedelic hallucination and the altered state of the psyche industrial neurosis

0,ranking every grateful dead vocalist from best to worst well there you go i ve tried to rank every singer on our favorite band from good to not so good criterion includes two part boring technical factor such a phrasing power range control and versatility and band factor such a the extent to which the member’s vocal contribution helped define the group a well a the ability to blend with the other voice of the band and the consistency of the said voice 1 ron pigpen mckernan 1965 1972 the single greatest singer the dead ever had it s really not even close pigpen s voice wa strong and soulful and his emotion wa out of this world you could really hear the despair in it hurt me too and the horniness in good lovin even when his health deriorated and he wa a shell of his former self his voice remained intact can’t same the say about everybody most importantly he wa without doubt the only thing close to a frontman the band ever had he had an undeniable charisma and command of the audience especially during lovelight long before the heroin year and the gate crashing dolt when people said they were going to see the dead during the 60’s they were actually going to see pigpen best performance just listen to him singlehandedly destroy the pa during it’s a man’s world at winterland 2 jerry garcia 1965 1995 the most emotional and mature voice of the band by far his voice wa definitely not strong and his wasn’t really a technical singer none of them were but by god did he know how to convey emotion his broken nasal voice wa the perfect instrument for story of despair and loss such a wharf rat and black peter you could really believe that august west spend half of his life drunk on burgundy wine or that peter’s fever rolled up to a 105 he wa maybe not in his element during the rocker which demanded a stronger voice a well a a frontman persona that the fat man never had and this is why weir had the job of ending second set with full on rock screaming mania best performance this morning dew 3 donna jean godcheaux 1971 1979 yeah yeah i know but listen donna is the only classically trained vocalist the band ever had and she proved on many occasion that she wa not only a good singer but a wonderful one her weakest point is her inconsistency and her inability to hear herself especially in her early ear yet from 1975 to 1978 she wa absolutely beautiful whenever she opened her mouth her vocal contribution in jgb a well are the stuff dream are made of most importantly she is the only vocalist in this list whose technique evolved towards the better she wa at her worst in 1971 1972 and at her very best towards the end of her tenure but sadly it wa the exact oppoite for her husband and it cost her her place in the group best performance this 4 bob weir 1965 1995 his bobness began a a third wheel to the bravado performance of pigpen and young garcia and boy did he come a long way since 1971 he became the ying to garcia’s yang and almost all concert from then and all the way to 1995 incorporated the bob jerry bob jerry routine to their setlists only sporadically interrupted by another vocalist’s a keyboardist donna or phil number he took on pigpen’s role a frontman and did the best he could his voice wa equally suited for coutry ballad and screaming rocker and many of his contribution are staple of the group’s discography what differenciates him from garcia is that most of the time he looked like a rock artist and not a meditative bearded monk and actually looked like he wa having a great time screaming left and right and prancing around in short short you know just your typical rock god attitude best performance this 1982 llr 5 brent mydland 1979 1990 mydland judged a a single entity would probably top this list his voice is strong powerful and emotional but a part of the grateful dead he did have his detractor he did an ok job with donna’s harmony a well a with keith’s part he even did amazing work with some of the cover but his personal contribution just scream 80’s and not in a good way and are some of the most synth filled michael macdonald greatest hit wannabe the band ever produced and looked completely out of place in a grateful dead setting those song were pure cheese like 10 000 ton of cheese best performance this nice dear mr fantasy 6 vince welnick 1991 1995 poor guy vince never had it easy it’s not that there wa anything wrong with his voice he wa great in harmony i’d say better than brent and his keyboard playing wa adequate a well yet for some reason his voice never did it for deadhead and unlike donna he never worked or even seemed to care for that aspect a thing were falling apart left and right around him he wa the right pic kat at a very bad time plus you know you’re in trouble when your best known song is samba in the rain best performance this way to go home 7 phil lesh 1965 1995 aaaah phil i think it go something like at her at her cat making cat on a best performance the american beauty version of box of rain these member were part of the group a well but never sang or sang very sporadically tom constanten bill kreutzmann mickey hart keith godcheaux

0,jack o heart and his six horse chariot a poem about experiencing jerry a a 21st century kid i wa born in 1997 so jerry and i never shared the planet at the same time much le did i get to see him live despite that i ve been on the bus for year hour after hour after hour of listening and jamming numerous dead and co phil show over the last few year even doing some dead tune whenever i play show solo acoustic singer songwriter stuff and unlike almost any single human i know jerry is alive and wide open in my soul and heart that s the power of music and an incredible legacy of art and energy and passion and it s all preserved for eon to come in a way i m happy to be part of the first generation of latter day deadhead who prove just how incredible that musical body is how long reaching it is and how well preserved it all is i love how i can jump onto the computer or pop in a cd and it s an unspoken dialogue of hey jerry great to hear you again where you tuning in from today 73 89 69 let s go man i m sure for you guy who did get to see jerry it s equally a great to be able to jump back in time and remember anyway i wrote this poem a a very artsy fartsy expression of the eternal timelessness of jerry s music and spirit living on in the modern age jack o heart and his six horse chariot hope you enjoy peering into the window screen a man by the name of jack o’hearts appears to dazzle a frozen slice of infinity with his six horse chariot the window i’m at is bolted down by the hammer of time unceasing and the glue of mortal encapsulation but it doesn’t matter now because i have a window screen and the curtain are pulled and light on and even if they were closed and velvet black jack o’hearts ha a little magic trick he rally round his horse now and his friend who crowed in dark room while the chemical and fantasy of dawn had grouped them in a mystic destiny and with one howl and one fair sweep the horse storm forth from their master like thunder cloud on an interlocking sky except the sky is the air i breathe and in that air the horse dart through the window and the boundary of existence they snort and they neigh in their victory and encircle my heart with wandering wonder hour seem to roll like century they cake me in their kicked up dust sweat from my overjoyed dance roll and tear from my pierced soul trickle they clean the dust off with no spot missed and the window start to close up shop but not before jack o’hearts look at me with his now transcendent smile beaming and say hello to me an onlooker from a day he will never step foot in with his shoe but freely trot clear through to my delight with his six horse chariot a blazing jack o’hearts o jack o’hearts may you meet me with your stallion when all form and time lay vanquished and the bird of light are free until then i’ll see you tomorrow through the windowpane

0,it s impossible to say that the dead had a best show of all time there are several different era of the band and within them perhaps a best show but it wouldn t be right to say there is one that rule them all i wa listening to 8 27 72 last night a show that many a deadhead say is the best show of all time i myself prefer may 1977 a my favorite era hard to nail down a specific show though my point is there are just so many moving part within the band over their 30 year that it s impossible to say there is one that is better than the rest take 8 27 72 for example you have keith just playing beautiful stuff and matching up with jerry phil and bobby independently however a a side note i know that jerry didn t like that keith would just repeat jg s riff there is a lot of that evident here you also have one drummer billy just absolutely killing it and ostensibly loving being the sole drummer then move to 1977 and you have a very inconsistent keith arguably le adventurous and with it than he wa in his first few year with the band it change the dynamic considerably it of course go without saying that there are a group of deadhead who liked the dead the most with pig and didn t like them afterwards it s almost like you d have to dissect the band by era in order to pick a favorite show picking one best out of 2 000 is a fool s errand but it show the beauty of the amazing cross section we have a fan and that there is something there for everyone maybe we should be talking about our subjective favorite show not a best show

0,i finally figured out why i don t like deadco being serious give me a chance granted i ve not seen the real deal only born in 90 but i saw the dead in 09 furthur a couple time ratdog chicago ftw and i ve seen four deadco show hopefully that help to set the tone on to why i think deadco is a bad incarnation the screen every iteration of the dead before deadco omitting ftw ha lacked screen i e they ve just had light at the show no actual led screen show moving image deadco is great fun to listen to but if you re couch touring or at a show it s patently john and friend the screen never cut away from john during anything other than bob s vocal and even then you are sometimes forced to watch john s o face this ha had an obvious effect on the music a john think it s cool to be the star and therefore lead every jam go back and listen to the interplay between the bass key and guitar during a furthur show it s like night and day deadco is all guitar all the time i m quite aware that deadco is a great scene don t get me wrong but musically it s simply lacking a lot of what made the dead the dead

0,can t really get into 80 dead anyone got a show that will change my mind nothing against brent he s an amazing keyboard player but sometimes his sound are a bit too indicative of the decade while much of the dead s music sound pretty timeless to me that being said after starting out in the pigpen era keith and donna took a little while to grow on me a well so i don t think i m a complete lost cause i ve heard nightfall of diamond and i enjoyed listening to that but doe anyone have any brent show that could change my mind about 80 dead a a whole bonus point if it s got a dark star or some other psychedelic jam

0,what would have happened to pigpen if he stayed alive i found myself thinking about this on his birthday last week had pigpen not died so young do you guy think he would have continued with the band with keith and donna then with brent and vince a a second keyboardist and occasional singer all the way to july 9 1995 or would he have chosen a different path maybe a a solo act how would he have reacted to the weird musical world of the 80 s and 90 s i know his role diminished mainly because he got sick so what would have happened if he stayed healthy at least until summer 1995

0,i want to hold a grateful dead acid test party at my college i go to a mid sized midwest undergraduate college known for being a party school it s occurred to me recently that not a lot of these people know how to party other than getting hammered in sport jersey occasionally throwing coke in the mix if that s they re thing for the vast majority of these kid that think they re very cool that is the pinnacle of the college experience at the risk of coming off super bitter i find it pathetic hardly any of my peer seem to know a damn thing about psychedelics much le jam music and it deeply disheartens me to think that so many will piddle their way through these year thinking partying music never get any more fun than booze and the chainsmokers including this year i have a two year left at this school i have made it my goal no my mission to hold a grateful dead themed acid test party before i graduate start at 11 pm get some crazy light and just groove all night tie dye and 60 s dead themed party kinda became cool on college campus like a year or two ago but from my understanding it wa pretty superficial and didn t get any deeper than that side note i m an ra this year and don t have a house working on changing that next year but know plenty of buddy with house my buddy here aren t heady like the one i have back home what s a solid game plan socially for bringing this crazy idea of mine to fruition scope out the head then proceed there s like 7 000 undergrad here and i ve yet to find any or more guerilla tactic get good friend with someone very popular convince them this is a good idea then proceed ok this is a pipe dream and one that i am likely overthinking but it want it to come true dancing on psychedelics at dead co show are some of the more fond memory in my life and nothing against most of you who are older than me and my jam friend i think it is time that a new generation be taught firsthand how awesome that can be i want to do mission work here i have a firm belief that just about everyone s a deadhead whether or not they ever figure it out any thought or maybe advice on this crazy idea or how it could be marketed to a generation that doe not yet understand it any other college aged head here ever try anything of the sort or wish to

0,built to last i prefer the early 70 dead so i haven t really listened to many of their later song but today i wa listening to a show from 89 and they played the song built to last a i wa listening to the lyric i couldn t help but think that the meaning of the song seemed to contradict so much of the dead s philosophy i recall in a long strange trip jerry talk about how he doesn t want to build anything that can t be teared down that he want the music to be constantly in motion and never stagnant is this song an ode to how time have changed and their philosophy ha changed or is there something else that i m missing here

0,how and why dark star is making a cameo on my next album please let me explain it properly i m a brasilian musician for most of my career my lyric and overall songwriting ha been inspired in history literature philosophy and politics about two year ago a very dark depression and anxiety combo took over my life this came with a major shift in my writing process it started to become gradually inclined to an introspective instrumental oriented autobiographical overview of the fight against mental ilnesses and also about the quiet life that wa my way of fighting back my country is also facing very dangerous time a major political and economical crisis created a very fertile soil for the rise of political polarization and even some far right wing ideias started to make a sad comeback that s when the dead kicked in since they re not very well known in brazil i only knew the surface of their art and story then i decided to have a good listen of american beauty and well you know the story after a few week they became a major influence in my art and my music and in my life also i sort of became that annoying friend that keep talking about a band so i m finishing my new album in one or two week many of the song drink from the dead and one of them is specifically about the first time i sat down turned off the light and listended to live dead s dark star even though the album is not ready and i can t really show it to you it ocurred to me that sharing a bit of this long strange trip with my fellow deadhead isso something i owe to this band that made such a difference in my life greeting from brazil

0,i posted this on game of throne board but mod took it down thinking it wa a joke i m serious though a dance with dragon came out in 2011 everyone wa excited until they finished the book and it looked like the wind of winter may be released in our lifetime the original release date wa some time in 2015 or 2016 between 2011 and 2015 grrm wa leaking chapter that he had wrote out to the public either through his website or at various convention thing were looking good for a 2015 release but then in april 2015 martin commented on his blog that the wind of winter will not be eligible for the 2016 hugo award which is awarded for science fiction or fantasy work of the previous year 52 but he also said he would like to have it published before the sixth season of the hbo series game of throne which would cover material from the book aired in 2016 thing then changed in early january 2016 martin confirmed on his live journal that he had not met an end of year deadline that he had established with his publisher for release of the book before the sixth season of the hbo show martin also revealed there had been a previous deadline of october 2015 that he had considered achievable in may 2015 and that in september 2015 he had still considered the end of year deadline achievable on january 10 2017 martin announced on his blog in a response to a comment that he believed that the wind of winter will be released this year referring to 2017 however he also noted that he believed the same thing would occur the previous year he confirmed on his blog that he wa still working on the wind of winter a of july 22 2017 being still month away from finishing the book he also indicated that it may not be published until 2018 or later so what happened why did grrm think he wa going to release the book in 2015 then 2016 then 2017 and now he ha no idea because of the grateful dead it should come a no surprise that grrm is a deadhead with jerry garcia lead grateful dead guitarist vocalist passing in 1995 there were few outlet for grrm to see the music so his only outlet wa to fill the book with reference to grateful dead song this hasn t been a big deal until 2015 in 2015 the surviving member of the dead rejoined for their 50th anniversary and had a show in california and a show in chicago which grrm wa seen at so that pushed back his initial release date of 2015 from summer to end of the year not a big deal until dead company formed with a few member of the grateful dead along with john mayer they had a fall winter tour in 2015 well there go the 2015 deadline no biggy they can t continue touring right they are old so that s why in january 2016 grrm thought he could still finish the book nope dead company loved what they were doing so they announced a summer 2016 tour and then they did it again in 2017 and now there are rumor of a winter 2017 tour and already date announced in mexico in february 2018 my theory is that unfortunately for asoiaf fan a long a the band keep on playing there isn t going to be a book released sorry folk tl dr grrm is tripping on acid and following the dead on tour instead of writing

0,recreating the wall of sound since i watched long strange trip i have been thinking about the wall of sound ha anyone ever tried to re create the a wall of sound i know that pa s are much clearer and more powerful now not to mention smaller and cheaper still it seems a if the physic are much different than the speaker bank on each side of the stage a is common now i know there are different dead cover band all over the country and from some of the stage setup instrumentation i assume have quite a bit of money it s kind of surprising that no one ha tried to re create the wall is it the fact that these band play venue that have insist on using their own pa it would be much more expensive than using a traditional system of 2 bank of speaker and re mixing a stereo image but on balance speaker equipment are cheaper and smaller and lighter than they were in 1973 i can think of a million reason not to re create a wall of sound but it seems a if it would be cool a hell to see it done

0,praise for dead and co probably unlike a lot of you i never saw the dead live a i wa 4 when jerry died no one in my immediate family wa a big fan but a few year back my uncle and cousin got me into them since 2014 there hasn t been a week i ve went without listening to their music i didn t get the chance to see any of the reunion work live until this summer when i managed to convert a few friend into casual fan i saw the second night at fenway and couldn t have been more satisfied 90 of people wearing dead shirt and somehow there wa still a huge variety most of the other show i go to see are smaller act often with multiple opener or joint show where half the audience is there to see the guy i ve never heard of or to party indifferent to who s even playing the sense of community at fenway wa just awesome for me of course the experience wasn t a nostalgic but it wa like all of a sudden something i had only looked at in a historical view wa fast forwarded into the present most of my background knowledge come from reading memoir and watching the recent documentary like i wa studying their history actually seeing it and finding that the music really ha never stopped wa an experience i ll always remember i can t wait to see dead and co again next tour my sole complaint would be that i d really like to see phil live too

0,dead and company grateful dead so in response to some comment i made today someone posted the following a for the people comparing this to gd your missing the point and the culture ha outgrown you step inside and see the new paint and sit on the updated furniture that is the music bob weir is a icon and so is the rest of the survivor of gd these show and band is not a attempt to recreate the gd experiencing but more of a exploration to find the new and that got me thinking about whether or not it is a valid thing to compare dead and company to the grateful dead leave aside for the time being that it is perfectly valid for anyone to compare the experience music and anything else for one band to another this being a matter of personal taste but really are you missing the point and ha the culture outgrown you if you do compare dead and company and the grateful dead i don t know haven t made up my mind but i guess i will before we re done with this thread the question i guess is defining what exactly dead and company is is this an extension of the grateful dead and offshoot of the grateful dead a dead cover band a dead tribute band or something else the fact of the matter is that they are definitely related to the grateful dead beyond just sharing three member let s start with the name dead and company so even the band drag the grateful dead into the name look at the symbology stealies bear 13 point lightning bolt skeleton rose flying eyeball terrapin the bus vw bus camper bertha skeleton with lute etc it s all there and those are all undoubtedly grateful dead symbol and chosen for themselves and adopted by the band this isn t something the audience is hoisting on them then there are the song other than 1 song they play all the rest are either grateful dead song or song covered by the grateful dead on a regular basis the exception being a hard rain s gonna fall i remember an interview with chris cornell in which they were talking about his cover of billie jean and he said a good cover is one that stick to some of the basic but then make the song your own by that standard dead and company could be a gd cover band but a full 50 of the band member are a part of the original gd if king crimson can call itself king crimson and have robert fripp a the only original member then saying that dead and company is an extension of the gd isn t a stretch the fact that their approach to the song is different than gd s raise the issue that would you call gd s approach to estimated in 1990 the same a gd s approach to estimated in 1977 or how about gd s approach to dark star in 1990 compared to gd s approach to dark star in 1969 so is this just another band along the same evolutionary path and of course since the gd had at least two player with a completely unique style jerry and phil you can t expect this evolution to sound the same not unless people try emulate jerry and phil and we ve already seen what fake jerry doe to people s mental well being so is it valid to compare the dead and company experience to the grateful dead experience well you go into a show you listen to the same song you would have in a gd show with a twist to them which would also be normal from one gd show to another would it be normal to make a comparison i understand that there may be people at show today who never saw the grateful dead and hence can t make a first hand comparison but that s no different to someone like me who never saw the grateful dead play a small venue like the avalon or a show in say 1968 that wa a completely different side of the band and by the time i got on the bus in the late 70 it wa much bigger playing venue that held 5 12 000 people and by the end they were pulling in close to 100 000 people on some show and of course the musical style had changed dramatically compare a show like 3 15 1990 or 3 29 1990 to say 5 anything 1977 so a i thought by the time i finished typing this i have managed to convince myself yes it is a valid thing to compare the two yes it s new paint and new furniture but just like you would compare a home before and after a remodeling it s valid and just because it is different doesn t mean it s outgrown anyone some people may actually have like the old decor better doesn t mean they can t like the new or use the new just liked the old better just like i like chocolate cake better than carrot cake still like them both

0,country influence and the bakersfield sound i m looking for any and all resource and content related to the country influence of grateful dead and the country musician they played with in the late 60 and early 70 i ve always preferred the early dead sound the bluesy country is where i think they really shined i know they had cross pollination with new rider of the purple sage and flying burrito brother i know they went up to bakersfield and let that sound influence them a lot which is what drove a lot of the sound in workingman s dead and american beauty i know of david nelson and gram parson but not much beyond a couple studio album and a few band they were in what i m asking is for anyone with any type of memory or vault or anything like that dig in a bit and let me know what you find any information is good information even if it s just a story you want to tell what wa the nature of the relationship between grateful dead and new rider of the purple sage and flying burrito brother a well what other band and musician from the country bakersfield scene did grateful dead work with what other band from that scene influenced them if they didn t work directly together tangentially what are the lesser known band from the bakersfield scene that i could listen to to get a feel for the scene a a whole on the flip side of that what are the well known band that are a must listen for anyone getting into it this isn t limited to just band that interacted with gd and a a side mission where doe david crosby fit in with all this wa david and the dork just a one off show or did they work together more i suppose my interest here isn t specifically about grateful dead really what it is is that grateful dead ha made me aware of the bakersfield sound and i want to know more about that sound in the context of how it interacted with the san francisco sound and how the musician of each scene influenced each other and tangentially anything about the cross pollination between country western folk and psychedelic blue rock and of course any live recording are greatly appreciated a a reward for reading this far here s some nrps with jerry thanks and keep having fun

0,are parliament funkadelic p funk the closest thing there is to a black grateful dead ive been a fan of george clinton and p funk for a long time and cant help but see many similarity to the dead just a few of the reason i can think of 1 they are heavily influenced by lsd and psychadelic culture a well a coke heroin and other drug 2 they play loose jammy seemingly endless set 3 they have lot of great psychadelic imagery associated with them google pedro bell 4 their music wa a fusion of all the great black american genre soul r b funk rock blue etc 5 constant touring even today so do you agree are there many other deadhead here into p funk i think the greatest tragedy is that there is not an archive of all their show like there is with the dead just a couple live album and some show on youtube

0,tour wa great but i ve been thinking about tour recently i did 16 show this past tour hitting all of the west coast and some of the east coast show a well i ve had an amazing experience doing so however one thing bothered me my friend been trying to get me tuned onto phish so i opened their webcast and watched it not really a big fan of the music but curious nevertheless whenever i d be at dead show i would notice that so many people would be on their phone nearly a quarter of the pit at any given time would be taking picture video etc i counted only 4 max whenever the camera panned towards the crowd at the phish show the fact that i could count them wa stunning enough i ve watched live webcasts of dead and company too and i d still see a significant part of the pit just taking picture and there s nothing wrong with that i take maybe 10 picture in a short burst maybe a video but never do i spend half the show on my phone not to mention when i would watch video of alpine show or old shoreline show with the dead everyone would be dancing there were a few that weren t but for a most part it wa pretty livid at the phish show it wa the whole pit moving not just bit and part the pit is mostly stagnant at the dead and company show i m not bashing on dead and company in any way nor am i a big fan of phish i ve seen d c about 20 time given past tour i just really wish more people would listen to the music play and hope so on the next tour just a little rant just thing i ve noticed along with people never knowing when to be quiet standing on the moon wa hard to hear at wrigley night one this year because of how loud everyone wa talking again i love the dead with all my heart and the lovely community a well but it just irks me that some people go to these show and don t even listen to the music play love you all just wanted to hear your thought on this

0,mexico show theory so here s the way i look at it i think the boy are doing these show for a few reason first off they probably get a few week or two stay at a top notch resort in mexico to play that s a pretty sweet deal for them bobby s old and i bet he love the beach checker is probably gonna show off some checker at the beach the environment of playing at the beach the vibe and the mood also probably make the show really fun to play i don t think they re doing this to cater to the rich like some people are saying if they were doing that they wouldn t have done a fairly large u tour all summer at reasonable price i think they re just going to have a good time at beach and play some cool tune
0,doe anyone need a ticket to the jerry garcia 75th birthday show at red rock on aug 4 i ended up with one extra ga ticket and i wanted to see if anyone in this sub needed one before i go to craigslist or whatever i heard it sold out pretty quick a much a i d love to miracle someone i have a newly minted master s degree and the accompanying debt but no job yet so i m just hoping to get face value for it which is 60 with fee and stuff it s a hard copy ticket so it will probably have to be someone in the denver area who can meet me and snag it let me know if you re interested edit i sold it to a fellow r gratefuldead head thanks y all

0,i wish d c would play more jerry ballad to lay me down so many road come a time ship of fool i believe none of those have been played with the exception of sof which wa played once back in 2015 i think mayer and oteil s voice are more than good enough to do these song justice and i am a huge fan of the jamming the band doe in the middle of the jerry ballad already in their repertoire i d love to see them play stuff like standing on the moon and day between more often too i wouldn t mind them toning down the rock song casey jones omsn china rider etc a bit in favor of some slower more emotional stuff doesn t have to be super often but given how frequently they re playing the more up tempo tune they could definitely make room

0,recent john mayer interview dead fandom d c discussion being at 13 40 not sure if this ha been posted already but mayer ha some beautiful thing to say about jerry and his legacy and about what dead and co mean to him he also ha some interesting thought on dead fandom and how head could be more welcoming to newcomer best of all he say he ll be playing this music for the rest of his life i think his comment on accessibility of the music is astute it took a long time for many of u to really get the dead but once we do reached that mountaintop a mayer put it it wa truly life changing personally it took me year of casual listening before the music of the dead became an obsession it even took this literal generational guitar talent mayer himself awhile to get it he talk about listening to song in a certain order to fully grasp what s going on i d be curious to hear him go more in depth about that getting people into the music whether just to find a concert buddy or to ensure the music endures into the next generation and beyond is really difficult i would love to learn how to make the music more accessible

0,the best show here is the list of some fire dead show that everyone should check out i am not done putting my discription of each show yet but i am close to being done i think peak performance 8 27 72 sunshine daydream every song is straight fire and could be considered a their best version of each song every song that appears on this album usually win for the best version but there are still other poppin version of the song from this show china cat sunflower i know you rider is the best ever an epic dark star deal sound like freight train going down the track 8 13 75 one from the vault is a really tight show with the entirety of blue for allah and is definitely one of their best arguably the best help slipknot music never stopped ever played the best eotw drum gdtrfb ha a really cool mix of standard and half time for the drum when it first starting 5 8 77 cornell this is a fucking tight 77 show not my favorite 77 show but from general consensus and the performance of the show it is a must it ha the best dancing in the street ever performed also a great they love each other great acoustic show 5 2 70 dick s pick vol 8 the acoustic set is golden the electric set ha a really intense other one 5 15 70 road trip vol 3 num 3 the acoustic set is just a good a 5 2 but a little le acclaimed st stephen from the early show china rider cumberland blue and hard to handle are all good reckoning great show 8 24 68 two from the vault this ha one of the coolest dark star ever played it ha such a cool 60 s psychedelic sound 2 11 69 live at the fillmore east 2 11 69 11 8 69 dick s pick vol 16 the entire second set is one the master piece of the live dead 1 23 70 dave s pick vol 19 i feature some song that cant be found in 5 2 or 5 15 but is a really good 70 show probably my favorite from the year that isn t acoustic it also mark the transition of the dead into playing more individual song instead of a bunch of song linked together 2 13 70 dick s pick vol 4 this and the next night tend to be alot of people favorite show but i like others more 2 14 70 dick s pick vol 4 4 25 71 4 29 71 lady and gentleman the grateful dead skull and rose the dead were straight rock and roll at this time and it make everything fast distorted and true fire 11 15 71 road trip volume 3 number 2 dark star el paso dark star 4 8 72 europe 72 cumberland blue brown eyed woman 4 26 72 europe 72 one of the best europe 72 show played one really cool the other one bertha is really good and ha one of the best turn on your love light since 70 5 3 72 europe 72 5 7 72 europe 72 the whole show is good it ha much more of a 71 sound to it compared to the rest of europe 72 5 26 72 europe 72 usually a crowd favorite among europe 72 but first set a little rickety to me second set is on 11 21 73 road trip volume 4 number 3 12 10 73 grateful dead download series volume 8 5 14 74 dave s pick vol 9 6 26 74 dick s pick vol 12 a fire china cat sunflower i know you rider 10 16 74 10 20 74 steal your face the grateful dead movie soundtrack 6 18 76 grateful dead download series volume 4 a really killer set even though it mostly mellower song one really good music never stopped and a good big river 4 30 77 grateful dead download series volume 1 a really good 77 show probably my favorite spring 77 bertha and my favorite 77 scarlet fire the music never stop is on point and keith ha a really unique sound this show for the song 5 13 77 may 1977 holy shit this should be the show people go to instead of 5 8 77 in my opinion but just give it a listen gdtrfb omsn u blue close the show and it an absolute knock out probably the tightest one more saturday night band ever played also donna kill cassidy 5 19 77 dick pick vol 29 the best estimated profit 5 28 77 to terrapin real similar to 5 13 77 but a little more laid back song wise compared to 5 13 77 9 3 77 dick s pick vol 15 11 4 77 dave s pick vol 12 it a really good show and show the beginning of the 78 dead 7 1 78 july 1978 the complete recording the whole show is amazing they showed up 2 hour after they were suppose to go on an played 45 minute over it wa willie nelson birthday celebration and the dead knocked it out with this show the beginning of the first set is fantastic but friend of the devil me and my uncle big river is one of the coolest piece of music the dead performed in their career also ha one of their best terrapin station and one of their best playing in the band s also a really good wharf rat 7 5 78 july 1978 the complete recording beat on down the line ha a cool intro by kieth and once the song start jerry start playing faster then almost any other time in the history of the dead it all over now is probably my favorite version from the godchaux era 7 8 78 red rock bertha new minglewood blue deal wharf rat franklin s tower sugar magnolia 5 15 80 go to nassau jack straw franklin s tower china rider gdtrfb good lovin ha one of the best gdtrfb s ever played 5 16 80 go to nassau feel like a stranger athelea the best athelea 12 9 81 dave s pick vol 20 a great china cat sunflower i know you rider scarlet fire and close with i cant get no satisfaction 4 5 82 road trip volume 4 number 4 shakedown street 4 2 89 download series vol 9 it all over now is really good cause of brent s solo shakedown street 4 3 89 download series vol 9 3 24 90 3 26 90 dozin at the knick 3 29 90 wake up to

0,thought on john s playing in atl first off what a great fucking show set list wa outstanding not a dud in it and how cool wa that lightning storm behind the stage this is all in reference to john s improvising during jam 1 didn t it seem like he wa hesitant to step out on a ledge seemed like he kept backing off from really grabbing the rein and relied heavily on effect the effect were rad and all but it confused me because weir ha said that they picked mayer for his ability to listen not necessarily play which lead me to 2 john did not seem to pay attention to the rest of the band much during jam there were multiple time when either the rhythm section or the entire rest of the band had developed motif that john kinda just plowed through the only time this didn t really seem to be the case wa in knockin on heaven s door thought

0,please tell a millennial what this bruce hornsby song meant to you i am putting this here because bruce hornsby doe not have his own sub reddit that i can find i went down a deep youtube rabbit hole of 80 s music it started with acdc halen and gun and rose then it kinda started to veer reo speedwagon y before i knew it i found myself at the end of a youtube recommendation line bruce hornsby i had never heard of this guy but i know know those key stroke from tupac s change after all i wa a 1990 born 16 year old once at first the rat tail threw me off but that melody rang so sweet my eye saw no tail the next youtube magic 8 ball pick wa his second biggest hit madolin rain it wa my first time ever hearing this song honestly i thought the song itself wa fire it wa one of those one were it only take one listen and your mashing the replay button but the video is something else pretty much the band rocking out under a tent in the rain camera man wa spinning in circle while sliding barbra walter filter over the lens plus the stare down by the drummer the end shoot dagger through your as but hornsby ha something about him a serious swagger thats why i must know a someone not born when this song came out 1 how wa it received wa it lame it ha close to 4 million hit on yt 2 wa this anyone break up song at 15 to 18 3 do believe he played the accordian 4 where were they playing this at the time it came out did it get radio play 5 wa this a chick song i am more or le curious about the 80 s music scene and how thing looked to the people listening at that time v someone who didn t expedience it and is getting a glimpse back via 80 s music youtube

0,so what the new wrinkle that weir wa so pumped about remember the rolling stone interview in may when bobby said the following but this new wrinkle which i m not at liberty to try to attempt to describe because i really won t know what we re looking at until a few day into it at least that s what s got me going right now the premise that we re working with is that when most people go to a show they re not really watching what s going on onstage they may be watching what s on the screen but when the song are playing in their mind s eye they re actually watching a movie they re watching the movie the song the character in the song is delivering they re watching a movie on the big screen in their head we re going to try to play to that so now that we are several show into the tour what exactly is he referencing is there something going on with the screen that wa not happening last time around i don t mean some new rose or skull motif overlay i mean something we have not seen on previous tour a stylistic departure if you will or is he talking about something entirely else

0,5 26 73 china rider and other thought wow this just totally stole my face a second ago the sound mix is absolutely perfect with jerry in the right channel and bobby in the left bobby especially can be heard very clearly this is not your usual china rider transition from 73 some of the transition like 10 19 73 are sort of relaxed and languid this one hit at full speed and bob resort to playing short and quick chord almost like a tighten up jam a opposed to the longer more spaced out typical feelin groovy chord i don t know how people can listen to the rich beautiful tone bob s guitar had in 70 71 72 73 74 and then listen to his playing from today i personally think his playing is hardly even professional anymore his poor playing is the real reason dead and company play so slowly anyone seen that video on youtube where he totally freak out because john mayer start a song he wasn t expecting he can t even go with the flow of the music anymore without his ipad telling him what to do i would literally rather see a mayer burbridge kreutzman trio any day over dead and co i can honestly see where chris robinson is coming from in his recent comment but the worst offender by far of sucking off of the grateful dead nipple are dead and co and bob weir himself it make me cringe when i read that he want dead and co to pick up where they left off in 95 giving dead and co too much credit only serf to discredit the magic that the grateful dead created on stage listen to that china rider from 5 26 73 and tell me that dead and co could do anything remotely a spontaneous and beautiful i m not trying to shit on bob weir or john mayer or dead and company but i wish some people would reevaluate their thought about this dead and co isn t even close to the real thing i would rather see more effort and attention being put towards finding lost tape restoring those of poor sound quality and spreading the inspired music of the grateful dead who in the world would want the dead s legacy to be a bunch of drugged out hippy that wa then resurrected by mainstream materialistic mayer dead and co for me are the opposite of what the grateful dead were jerry wa the quiet leader of the band who very willing traded off song with other band member bobby yell at people onstage and ha predetermined the set list not only are the set list predetermined but so is the playing there isn t the same improvisatory nature in dead and co a with the grateful dead with that being said i ll be heading to my third dead and co show this summer in ohio but i will not be talking about how the torch is being passed to mayer or comparing the experience to the true grateful dead experience i will be however continuing to crank my headphone and meditate to the sweet sound of the grateful dead

0,late criticism of john mayer by chris robinson i have read the ridiculous stuff robinson ha said my response is simply this i saw dead and company last year for the first time i wa skeptical to say the least when they came out on stage mayer wa chicken heading if that s even a thing from the start you don t do that unless you are into the music you can get up on stage and fake all kind of shit but you can t fake an 8 minute guitar solo or can you there ha to be some emotion there if the remaining band ha accepted him mickey bill bobby then i accept him hater gonna hate the grateful dead ha never been the same group of guy or gal ever yes jerry wa what we all considered to be the heart of the band but jerry said that pigpen wa the heart of the band it s different from year to year from concert to concert i m just happy to be along for the ride edit spelling drunk
0,can we stop hating on chris robinson this is a peaceful community let let bygone be bygone i love the dead i also enjoy listening to crb occasionally i don t agree with chris robinson s comment any more than the next deadhead around here and i ve noticed that there ha been a lot of hate towards him on this sub in the past couple day gd music spread a message of love and acceptance and i think we need to embrace that message right now yeah cr might have said some mean thing towards somebody that many of u including myself have a lot of respect for but that s no reason to continually bash on the guy and prod at him like butthurt child if you don t like him ignore him and go about your business there is no sense in spreading hate through this awesome sub that is all i love you all keep on truckin

0,come a time 5 9 77 i ve always loved this song it s one of hinter s simplest and most straightforward lyric and they played it infrequently enough that hearing it is always a pleasant surprise and the version on the last disc of the new 77 box is fucking amazing jerry s solo out of the last verse is long and heartbreaking they stay with the melancholy chord of the last part of the chorus for several bar and then slide seamlessly into the slightly more hopeful major chord that end the song continuing long enough to restore some slight hope that just maybe i will indeed see that it s not too late to fill my cup

0,born in the wrong generation rant there s nothing i ve ever found more annoying and pitiful than the angsty kid who think they re special for saying ugh i wa born in the wrong generation but a a 21 year old who fell in love with the dead a couple year ago i hate myself to say it but dammit i think i wa born in the wrong generation self hatred intensifies but seriously if i wanna do something similar to following the dead around these day it s dead and company which is awesome for many many reason one being that mayer ha tricked a lot of my peer into hoppin on the bus but for equally many reason it just ain t the same man the sociopolitical climate the ticket price the culture and i know it s not supposed to be the same i realize it s silly to pretend the year is anything other than 2017 i also realize that the dead were always counterculture and not mainstream so comparing them to say the chainsmokers is just illogical but i guess what i m trying to whine about is that i m tired of feeling so damn out of place a a deadhead in 2017 forgive me if you feel i m misappropriating the term it s not just that the modern jam scene is on the fringe and largely 40 year old but also i have a hard time grooving to say umph and discuits like i can with the dead the very notion of a jam band seems to be a group that attempt usually with a degree of failure to emulate what the grateful dead did can anyone else sympathize with me am i just another whiney kid who doesn t fit into his generation i suppose my real wish is that the modern dead jam scene can crawl out of the fringe into the size and quality of what it once wa but i suppose that might be hoping for a bit much edit i realize along with the rant that i totally lost sight of the main main point i really wanted to make which is the younger generation s general failure to embrace jam head are and always have been a minority but this is so to a very depressing degree in my generation

0,key scale mode general theory of dead song for dummy okay first and foremost i ll admit this thread is mainly for selfish purpose i want to know these damn song but i believe this could be very beneficial for everyone in here especially for beginner dummy like me the main idea behind this thread stem from this i stumbled upon and perhaps we and by we i of course mean those of you who know thing could build on it it s over 10 year old now and appears to be mostly dead ha or else i d just jump in there a lot of the answer i m looking for are in there but a you guy might have found when you were learning with every answer i find there seems to be 10 more question spawned also a lot of these question can be answered via google but it all get so confusing before i know it i ve got 10 tab open and gone down a rabbit whole on what the hell an ionian mode is that i ve forgotten what song i wa trying to learn in the first place it s like the damn davinci code just look at the thread i linked to someone say tleo is in c next post well actually it s in g with a c ionian scale then the next post well actually it s with g mixolydian which i m not sure mean it s in the key of c using g a the tonal center or if it s in g using d a the tonal center like i said with every answer there s more question then the next guy will say actually it bounce back and forth between this and that mode etc etc a you can see to a beginner this can all be quite overwhelming i ve got pretty basic fundamental understanding of major scale blue i iv v major pentatonic all that jazz wait no not jazz mixolydian is becoming clearer to me at least when it come to sugaree although somewhere in there someone say not to stay on mixo huh you can change mode but a soon a someone start goin on about ionian dorian aeolian chromatic minor pentatonic aries scorpio lion tiger bear oh my i start getting a damn headache and it all get convoluted anyway back to the original idea of this thread a place for people to ask question regarding key of song and suggested scale mode from those in the know and maybe explain a bit of theory behind it a a reference for beginner i m aware that a certain amount of experimentation is required recommended and of course searching out and finding answer is all a necessary part of the process and all that but most of the time i don t even know what to experiment with and it would still be good to have something to fall back to i ll start with the two song referenced above sugaree and or tleo what give edit i should probably note i m comin at this stuff a a beginner piano keyboard player if that make any difference at all

0,essay on thats it for the other one let me know what you think dont review it just read it to see if you agree this should be for fun picking a favorite song is much harder than one would think when i started thinking about it a favorite song should in a way provoke strong emotion to the listener i would say that my favorite song is that’s it for the other one by the grateful dead this song evokes quite a few different emotion within a single song and is never the same when played live coming in anywhere from 10 to 40 minute long it ha the potential to make the listener feel a different way every time in class we talked about how a song can be broken up into section with the song then a jam and coming back to the song again technically the song is broken up into two song written out on setlists a cryptical envelopment the other one cryptical envelopment in which cryptical is used to set the mood in the beginning and bring the listener back from the jam in the end i believe that this song is the epitome of sending the listener out into space and bringing them back again once it get too weird after cryptical is played generally the grateful dead drummer start doing their thing in my opinion a good version ha a strong drum solo section before the other band member join in this to me set the mood for the strong string intro that the song ha the drum section of the song is a true embodiment to the notion that the grateful dead are something you need to experience live at a live show in the right mind set the drum can transport you out of the show all the while building anticipation until the bass finally come in and the rest of the band join making you feel like the song is literally exploding this is my favorite moment in music a moment where the mixture of both precision and chaos are blended together once the song explodes jerry garcia’s lead guitar come shining through the madness the rhythm guitar setting the stage for a piercing section of jerry lick this section take the listener and force the person to listen intently on all that is happening jerry command one s attention in the way that the solo is played to the point where you feel on the edge of your seat even if you re dancing eventually the section slows down to where the jam take you away the band fall into a symbiotic relationship in which jerry is no longer the leader the entire band is promoting the direction that they take this is ended once the band come back into the original rhythm of the song after a period of time the bob weir sings spanish lady come to me she lay on me this rose it rainbow spiral around and round tremble then explodes left a smoking crater on my mind i d like it blown away but the heat come round and busted me for smilin on a cloudy day to me these lyric don t me much other than a reprieve from the madness that had ensued within the music before this point the instrumental section after this verse is much more mellow than the first following a standard progression with a defined peak but are the dead ever that straightforward this section can be a simple or complex a the band permit on any given night from here the band come back into the rhythm of the song and after a period of time bob weir sings the lyric escaping through the lily field i came across an empty space it trembled and exploded left a bus stop in it place the bus came by and i got on that when it all began there wa cowboy neal at the wheel and the bus to never ever land without time to even process what just happened you are thrust back into the song cryptical envelopment i truly believe this song wa added onto the other one to bring a sort of perspective to an otherwise chaotic song the first line being the other day it ended with rainbow color blended his mind remained unbended he had to die once again not sure what to think of the lyric other than the soothing emotion jerry’s voice brings this brings the listener back into reality with a mix of soothing vocal and mellow instrumentals after the phrase you know he had to die ha been repeated over and over more intense every time the instrumentals gain more steam until finally the instrumentals take over and intensely bring the listener to the end of the song i think that the average concert goer is missing out if a band isn t willing to venture out of their comfort zone i have seen many different jam band that on any given night will go out on a limb to present the listener with a gem of a version of a great song even after this i can t say that any of those song compare to that s it for the other one by the grateful dead

0,blue sky and similarity between the style of dickey betts and bobby jerry discussion hey folk so i ve been listening to the allman brother for a long time now but i ve recently been diving into the dickey betts warren haynes and allen woody era specifically 1992 seriously they were tight during this period anyways i have always thought dickey had a similar rhythm style to bobby even listening a far back a the fillmore 71 show but it is very apparent to me when i listen to version of blue sky from the 90 for example check out this one off of an evening with the allman brother band first when warren is soloing dickey s rhythm sound very much like bobby especially starting around 3 25 compare with bobby s rhythm on this franklin s tower from it just ha the same bounce to it with the same style of improvisation and when dickey solo in this version it sound like he is taking inspiration from jerry maybe playing the same kind of scale gregg allman said that when they were recording eat a peach a bunch of them dickey oakley and butch were obsessing over american beauty i ve always thought blue sky wa a very dead song and shared the same theme with sugar magnolia anyone think blue sky could have been dickey s tribute to the dead and anyone hear the stylistic similarity or am i crazy

0,how is dick pick volume 2 not the first release of the whole series volume 1 is good don t get me wrong but volume 2 is some next level dead each song from that show is a top 5 rendition imo from a one of a kind dark star to the spontaneity of falling into a sugar mag after bobby pluck a random mag note in the spacey part of dark star and the whole band rally around it and jerry just seems to have a tenacity about him in nfa right down to a near perfect hand off heading into going down the road i m just kinda surprised it wasn t the first release because it epitomizes so well what the dead were all about

1,favorite simple i always go back to halloween 96 and the baker s dozen version is a recent favorite what are your can t miss simple that i need to hear
1,can we all take a few minute to appreciate the walk away outro for most of my phish career i felt pretty neutral about walk away i always kind of lumped it in with the type 1 rocker like character zero julius etc and never thought of it a anything special just a cool high energy rock n roll cover with a good guitar solo at the end that all changed after seeing it in hampton this past year driving home on monday after that run i replayed the walk away from n1 and wa just blown away by trey s solo at the end i ended up listening to that version multiple time per week for the past few month and can t seem to get enough of it i decided to learn the song on guitar this past weekend and try to learn steal some of trey s lick this led me down a deep walk away rabbit hole and i thought some of you might be interested in what i learned hopefully this isn t all common knowledge already first some history the song wa originally written by joe walsh while he wa still in james gang and released on the album third in 1971 the song wa a hit and joe walsh went on to perform it with the eagle and solo for many year the original version showcase walsh s cranked marshall sound and some fairly standard blue soloing in 1988 phish covered it for the first time at pete s phabulous phish phest featuring a strong vocal performance by a sexy young page mcconnell phish s version stay pretty true to the original with the exception of some minor additional part added by the band the joe walsh version is in a major with a minor pentatonic blue melody solo the phish version add a c major d major climb a few time throughout the song plus some nice double stop bend from trey this addition doesn t really add much to the song at this point but it is important in the evolution of the song all these early version were fairly straight ahead and usually under 4 minute the cover wa a regular staple throughout the late 80 early 90 including an appearance within the infamous bomb factory tweezer in 1994 after that appearance the cover wa shelved for a few year it reappeared in 1998 at the greek theatre great show this version emerged from an out there reba and wa jammed out for a few minute before a smooth segue into simple the song wa played a few more time in 1 0 in it original form with nothing remarkable about any of the version i listened to the song wa shelved again throughout 2 0 when phish returned from their second hiatus in 2009 the song wa once again brought back into rotation including it first 3 0 appearance and my very first show starlake 6 18 09 almost 10 year ago in 2010 after over 50 total performance of the song a new version of walk away wa played on 6 17 2010 instead of doing the standard ending phish introduced a new outro chord progression the new progression wa a bm c d this climbing progression give the jam an endless rising feeling and the borrowed c major give the am pentatonic soloing a different flavor from listening to this recording it seems like the entire band jumped on the new progression right away which make me wonder if it wa spontaneous or if someone came up with the progression during practice and they decided to keep it if i ever get to meet trey i will ask him and see if he remembers regardless of how it came about the band liked the new outro and decided to keep it instead of the usual 3 4 minute the song wa now regularly 6 7 minute they performed it on a semi regular basis throughout 3 0 and every version i ve heard since then feature that soaring outro solo including this official release from 2010 this brings u to the hampton 2018 version it the best version of the song the band ha ever performed i d love to be proven wrong and one of my favorite solo trey ha ever played if you have access to the soundboard i recommend that because this recording isn t the greatest the song start out of rift with trey making the last chord of rift be the first a chord of walk away nice one trey standard composed section and then the outro page hammering away at the grand and bringing higher and higher octave in on his organ fishman banging the shit out of his drum while trey shred an absolutely face melting solo full of tasty unique and interesting lick intertwined with his signature lick and style the band built up the energy until it felt like the place wa going to explode and trey throw in some whammy bending towards the end to destabilize and increase tension before bringing it home and ending the set like most of you i listen to phish for the jam but these explosive type i solo are what originally got me into the band and make phish the rock n roll god that they are this ended up being a lot longer than i planned so tldr phish added a new outro section to their cover of joe walsh s walk away in 2010 i saw it again in hampton last year and became obsessed with that outro solo so i spent the entire afternoon yesterday studying the song and analyzing trey s playing listen to the 10 19 18 soundboard of walk away and have your face melted

1,top 5 show you ve attended and why not just the setlist jam but the vibe friend set and setting etc for a 3 0 kid like me 5 8 8 18 camden the last show i got to see before leaving the country for a very long time and so i often bask in this memory while i m overseas a lot of folk said night one wa better but i loved this one wingsuit scent and melt in the second set all blew me away and i relisten to it often also just continually blowing me away how every time i see it the better and better it get i wa also fortunate enough to be there with my closest friend including my little brother 4 7 8 16 mansfield i ve seen every show they ve played here since the return and heard a lot about this great wood curse that folk talk about this show kindof cemented it when they literally blew the pa system just a the second set wolfman s wa about to rip harder than it ever ha i haven t done my research but i d imagine this hasn t happened to the band since at least the early 90 and it s no wonder they probably won t be back anytime soon but i can t help but feel in my heart that it happened because the show wa just too good to be true the light jam is one of the very best i ve ever heard ever and the first set city wa also equally monstrous the other reason though is that i wa attending with my girlfriend at the time her first show that i had managed to talk her into and they played fast enough for you my alltime favorite phish song that i ve been hoping for ever since i started seeing the band truly special moment 3 10 26 10 manchester new hampshire is my homestate so when i saw this tour announcement i literally jumped for joy i wa in highschool at the time and me and my best pal zipped right over after getting out of class nh at the time and kinda still is a very unchill place when it come to just about anything fun but no one seemed to be giving a fuck about anything it sure wa a beautiful time sitting up on top of a parking garage smoking a joint in a place that any other night we d certainly be immediately arrested watching the plane take off before walking into the venue but goddamn did that band play someone said it wa their 1500th show that night and it wa a perfect night the light jam i think very much paved the way for great thing yet to come but my favorite moment wa hearing curtain with for the first time live one of my favorite song and one of the most ethereal jam there is pure serenity 2 11 28 09 albany my first phish show and what a first show it wa my dad who always supported my love for live music got the ticket a an early christmas present since he knew how badly i wanted to see the band and drove u 4 hour to get there and i ll never be able to thank him enough for this but if anyone reading this happens to have been there you ll know exactly what i m talking about i think i ve gotten really lucky with all the show i ve seen but having this night of all night a my first time seems pretty ridiculous with the second set seven clocking in at a combined 47 min this is still the longest combo i ve seen and it seemed pretty widespread belief through the community that this wa the night that the band really came back after the hiatus i wasn t really paying a much attention to that a much a i wa my own incredible happiness that such a band really exists playing music for the sake of playing music and having more fun up on a stage than just about anyone 1 10 23 13 glen fall for anyone there you know what i mean seeing phish play in a 4000 person venue is something that i m sure i ll never get to experience again stumbling into ga 5 hit deep to the opening chord of back in the ussr being played for the first time since their halloween show and the crowd literally blowing the roof off the band playing a perfect setlist in every way with a little bit of everything they do best an experience shared with my best friend in the world who ha since past away seeing them jumping over the rail through the crowd a soon a undermind hit the song we had both been waiting to see together just a truly beautiful memory and one that i ll cherish forever it s honestly hard to find the word for this one so i ll give up now anyhow if anyone here is so inclined i d love to read other experience i miss seeing these guy and miss seeing y all there and it feel really good to reminisce since it ll be another two year until i can get my sorry as to a show so if anyone s got the time i ve got the inclination

1,the end of phish and tour life it ha been good well guy it ha been fun touring driving cross country in my 1989 4runner flying cross country for endless show i loved it sure it wasn t the best for the planet environment traveling 10 s of thousand of mile per year via car and plane but at the end of the day we all loved the music and that energy is worth it to me but with the new green deal it look like we will likely have airline travel and combustion engine completely banned in the next 10 year since we are ready to totally put fossil fuel out of business which is 100 fine we must be ready and willing to accept the consequence almost everything we use is made of petroleum at some point the guitar the amp the internals of string the circuit board the machinery used to mine the metal get the wood make the pickup all require oil to extract synthesize create and put together there is no way trey or the band can even play music without petroleum making all of this possible i am okay with that but it is really going to suck losing the music industry and every other industry due to this but we must push forward just because oil make up everything around u in one way or another your computer your shoe your jacket your toothbrush your car tire your entire car your heating your phone your headphone your home your dog food bowl your ski boot your ski your helmet the new bike you bought the ps4 and xbox in your room the new bluetooth speaker you bought your lipstick your pillow your dish your camera the case your beer come in the plastic wrapping your cig pack the plastic holding your legal weed in your snowshoe etc doesn t mean we cannot make it it just mean we will have to change our lifestyle a little bit together we will have to carry on the legacy of tour and music in the new green age a something of a barbaric past something where it wa a fun time of debauchery and insanity but at the end of the day having phish drive around 3 4 tractor trailer using massive amount of oil while 10 s of thousand of fan fly around in gas guzzling airline and car to see music just isn t something we can support for this globe we all know this is true i know many of u will 100 stop driving and flying to concert this summer we will stay home on the couch made of synthetic fabric made from oil while munching on organic quinoa and kale upset that we can t drive to the store anymore but hey at least we have food ration from the government i m sure the corn and gmo soy will make u all better people but i have to say the worst part of all this is that phish doesn t even play in the usa anymore since they re multi millionaire give they are worth so much they are the most mobile and they left the country to avoid a heavy tax on the 1 since they are all in the 1

1,what a great time it is to be a phish fan folk i m sure much of this ha been talked about before but i probably don t read post online about phish nearly a much a most of you i just wanted to express some gratitude towards this awesome band and fanbase today phish lately seems like they are in the best place they ve been since 2003 some of you might argue 97 but i am an advocate of early 2 0 the show are pretty much consistently above average with big jam of some sort almost every night each and every show contains element of overall phishiness from every era the band seems to have an increasingly large energy since probably summer 2015 that say that they aren t afraid to push boundary try new thing and break out of the box in new way that they haven t had since the mid late 90 while at the same time their jamming now blend together element of all the style they had tried throughout the year to take their jamming to a place of you never know what you re gonna get we seem to have moved out of the bliss jam only era of 3 0 plus the setlist construction seems to get increasingly better and the newer song that they re writing are getting better than the cheesy dad rock we had come to expect from 3 0 more than anything the band seems like they re a happy a can be playing together and want to keep this going for a long a possible what a great time it is to be a phish fan can t wait for mexico i have a feeling this will be the best run there yet

1,some final thought opinion about phish 2018 post baker dozen felt eerily similar to post big cypress where would we go from here how could they possibly go up from here especially in 3 0 practice is paramount to good phish and with the band practicing 4 hour daily during the bd it seemed like it would be difficult to get back to that level of playing and jamming indeed summer 2018 felt like they had perhaps lost a step from the previous summer there were some moment show where that sparkle of brilliance broke through but the show for the most part weren’t complete and the jamming wasn’t a fluid when they got to alpharetta thing finally seemed to take a turn night 1 2 of alpharetta were excellent top to bottom show with big jamming however after that the show went to how they had been before alpharetta not bad by any standard just not quite at 2017 level curveball cancellation sucked but i think possibly could have been a huge blessing in disguise dick wa a great run but something changed in the 6 week between summer and fall tour the kasvot set not only got them practicing a lot but reignited a flame that i think wa missing in the summer fall tour in my opinion wa the best tour in all of 3 0 trey got some major chop back and the spacey sonar type ii jam style that had been born in 2017 wa improved upon and done more often we saw the return of the long form first set jam and big second set this fall tour had more top to bottom complete show than any i can remember since the return i think the best show of fall all rank amongst the best show of 3 0 this fall and new year run wa a consistent reminder of how i felt in my early day of phish 1994 1998 when every show would be exciting my vote for top show in order is a follows 1 12 30 18 msg 3 2 11 02 18 vega 3 3 10 19 18 hampton 1 4 12 29 18 msg 2 5 10 26 18 rosemont 1 6 08 31 18 dick 1 my vote for best jam of 2018 1 hampton golden age 2 msg split open and melt 3 msg everything’s right 4 vega split open and melt 5 hampton simple 6 vega mercury 7 rosemont tweezer 8 albany 20yl 9 msg 7 below would be way higher if there weren’t woos which completely killed the vibe of the jam 10 msg disease honorable mention hampton camel walk what are your thought

1,the magic of phish story time so today i put in my 2 week notice at work it s been a long time coming and something that i ve wanted to do for some time now needle to say the job wa making me unhappy on a day to day basis after i did it i started having 2nd thought did i do the right thing is this going to bite me in the as am i screwing over people that i genuinely like etc it s not a if i have no plan going forward i didn t do this without having my duck in a row so to speak regardless i had an odd feeling walking out of work today i put the notice in right before i left rewind to the morning i wa listening to 12 30 18 earlier in the day i generally have time to get 1 set of phish in before the real work start today seemed like the perfect day to rock the first set from that night fast forward to me leaving work and getting in my car to drive home mindlessly i hit play on the live phish app it s become such a routine in my life that i don t even pay attention to what song is on or coming up i just hit play when i get in my car it just so happened that everything s right wa at it opening chord it wasn t until trey starting singing that i realized the insane synchronicity that wa taking place time to get out i ve paid my due the long night s over and the sun s coming out everything s right so just hold tight here s the rest of the lyric in you need them very fitting for the situation sure you can call this a coincidence if you believe in that sort of thing i personally don t but that s a different conversation for a different time i like to believe that it wa god sending me a message through my favorite music while it wa happening i had goosebump all up and down my body i felt so assured in that moment that i did in fact do the right thing and that i m going to be happier a a result hearing those lyric wa what i needed at that exact moment in time when it ended i officially felt at ease with my decision i m not 100 sure what the next chapter in my book will bring for me but i am sure that everything s right so i m just holding tight hope y all enjoyed reading this love you guy and i ll see ya in the summer

1,psotd 118 weekapaug groove hello again and welcome back to my dumb list or for those of you who i met over nye welcome to your first installment i ve been slacking the last month or so because of the holiday s and travel i d like to give a special thanks to those that let me stay with them and welcomed me into their group over nye without you my trip wouldn t have been possible after this week i have to take an official hiatus from psotd so i can get some of my life in order really i ve just got to spend the hour a day i spend on this studying for this certification so i can get a better job after that i ll be back anyway here s what you came for weekapaug groove weekapaug groove wa first performed on and is accredited to phish proper the song take it name from the town of weekapaug located in southwestern rhode island according to an interview mike gave on 1997 09 09 the lyric are essentially meaningless he said so we came back to boston from weekapaug after playing a gig there at a yacht club and i guess we were in the van or the voyager we used to drive in and that song oh what a night came on the radio you know that one that awful four song we just constantly listened to song and changed around the word a to what they might sound like i always had a particularly hard time hearing lyric anyway so i always would sing a song on the radio sing along with the wrong word so the bridge of that song go oh i i i trying to something ’ but i wa singing it oh i i i trying to make a woman that you move ’ which mean nothing sharing in a weekapaug groove ’ so we all just started singing that a complete nonsense trying to make a woman that you move ’ it never occurred to any of u that it had any meaning ever there wa a period of time that we were singing it and i used to just yell out the lyric between singing them i would just yell them out a if i wa preaching them just to sort of make it more ironic that they have no meaning this would be confirmed by trey after the band played the song on at great wood you can hear the story a he tell it on the livephish soundboard of the show the main riff of weekapaug came to fruition during the first of three oh kee pa ceremony the band played for 11 hour in trey s riverside bungalow in plainfield vermont at the time the original riff wa much slower than the weekapaug we ve come to know sometimes the song is still played slowly we ve discussed mike s groove pretty thoroughly at this point weekapaug is always the end of it because of it s placement the song usually ha interesting tease sprinkled in past example of this include lion sleep tonight have mercy psycho killer and wipe out today we ll share in the from statistic weekapaug groove wa played at 26 68 of live phish show it wa last played december 30 2018 which wa 1 show ago there have been 1 668 show since the live debut weekapaug groove ha been played approximately once every 3 7 show since it debut weekapaug groove ha been played on average once every 3 4 show it wa played 485 time i d like to get one of those dumb shirt s that have the hello my name is sticker on it then under the name part have it say sharon n dagroove i feel like that d sell well
1,winterqueen just getting into this song after i heard trey play it in boulder a couple week ago yeah i know it not one of the jam filled heavy hitter but it seems a though it one of phish s more thoughtful song i wa wondering what you guy thought the song meant or at least what it mean to you
1,if the rumor are correct the first summer date will be announced tomorrow when bonnaroo drop their lineup already planning my trey face totem
1,what is your favourite atypical phish song by this i mean not a jam vehicle or a particular rarity you ve been chasing or something incredibly phishy i mean like a phish song that doesn t get played too often but that no one really covets hard but is still a great song i hope my description make sense i have two crowd control because i think the studio version is just bursting with energy and it s a fun song and sing monica partially because it s my daughter s favourite phish song but it s deliciously poppy and probably tom marshall s cleverest lyric
1,re bonnaroo rumor how doe phish sound at the main stage i ve listened to some of their roo set sound really nice i went to bonnaroo in 2013 and paul mccartney wa amazing and the sound wa great i m wondering have any of yall seen phish on the farm wa it a nice vibe good sound i want to make a decision on ticket thanks
1,mr and mr wallob were jerk to name their kid clueless way to set clueless up for failure out the gate
1,iso the perfect paug forever searching for a single weekapaug groove that combine my favorite element from different performance the perfect paug would include length and jamming depth similar to 12 31 95 and 1 2 15 face melting opener and fast tempo of 6 22 94 i hear 2 0 is ripe with lengthy paugs this wa the song that got me into phish
1,frank zappa s black napkin sound a lot like mike s song skip to 1 45 and it sound to me like i hear mike s song in there is this just a normal scale or something i have no musical training background
1,everyone’s talking about bonaroo what about woodstock would love this wayyyy more than bonaroo seems like a better fit for them and more within their home turf area of the northeast
1,in my opinion this is a yes it’s almost like the battle of the same date in 97 i like 12 29 97 better but i respect those who say 12 30 is king both all time show a were the two that happened last weekend here’s my reasoning why 12 30 win 12 29 wa awesome an absolute stunner of a show the energy from the crowd the band is what made the whole night the first set wa killer the energy just kept on adding up and the transition were on point i’m a huge sucker for the sloth so that wa awesome and that 46 wa so smooth ya mar is always fun and that wolfman party time wa incredible but i think the second set is a little overrated carini wa short when i hear an carini opening the second set i expect some fire what we got wa just average the wa obviously the highlight but i think get way too much credit after relistening several time i just haven’t got that jam it ha it moment i’ll admit but nothing compared to tweezer of recent year although the crowd eruption during the second tweezer wa ear piercing an absolute had to be there moment no wasn’t out of the ordinary for me it wa my third time hearing and in fact i got this same segue at lockn 2016 first tube wa all energy especially from trey the set wa fire straight fire mainly due to the flow but i don’t think it’s the best i’ve ever heard like other people are saying 12 30 on the other hand just had the upper edge for several reason to me set 1 wa mind blowing isn’t something we get too often and i love it especially a an opener the mike song wa the best of the year paug wa one of the best i’ve heard in year no men’s wasn’t anything special but that tube wa very good especially with the paug ending and of course we can’t forget to mention glide ii and bliss i wa sort of expecting it due to trey bust out on his solo tour but to have both of them in the same show almost back to back is legendary it’s not too often we get a phish original debut even though i wa there for end of session set 2 on paper doesn’t look all that great almost kind of a groan but let me tell you the jamming wa a everything’s right had a cdt camden 99 jam at the end just absolutely soaring at the end i couldn’t help but keep saying holy shit a it wa happening everything’s right is starting to become a favorite of mine plasma wa a pure funk pocket light wa a jam and a half but soam let me tell you wa the way soam should be played dark and spacey ck5 wa working fucking magic during it too couldn’t have been more perfect then the 4 song encore after mpp i thought i wa blessed for that encore but 12 30 wa incredible the perfect cap on the night even though i’m not a big cavern guy that show from top to bottom wa almost perfect better than last year 12 30 in my opinion all in all both great show and this is all just personal preference hope everyone enjoyed the show this run will go down a one of the great
1,full review of 2018 nye run 12 28 18 fun well executed but something is off set 1 the boy come out feeling the energy the crowd immediately showed and they go to outlive our brain and the crowd erupts this would just be the first of many energetic response to the band song choice through the weekend the tune wa mostly in form but got extended a few minute would turn out to be the longest extension to kasvot song played twice followed by martian monster and axilla just showed the excitement those 4 had to come out to play tonight felt like a breather damn perfect placement and the song had a nice peak to it a well i love if i could so i’ll check that box and take that in set 1 any day highlight thru the rest of the set include the meat got real saucy at the end ghost avg for song but continued that dark fun theme from meat personal opinion on the maze and wall i thought they had great tension throughout and the peak were nice but i thought it wa a little clunky coming out of the tension for that signature arm to the sky feeling we all love i’ll get back to this later see possum wall to me sounded a little rushed for the beginning composition and i feel like the band member namely trey struggled a bit with the timing but once he got his foot under him in the second half of the song man did he soar an excellent peak out to end a first set and overall i thought the set really flowed together well set 2 set 2 wa good not great i think the gem in here namely the soul free fuego peak gin possum are good version and the house wa really rocking a a person who doesn t necessarily love soul free i though the band had really good direction i love billy breathes so i did enjoy grabbing but in the 2 slot after that jam i felt conflicted haha the energy picked back up with the kasvot tun final hurrah which i am having a blast with these song they fit great with phish’s setlists flow and fuego i think this song is a little not my taste but the jam are rocking this peak especially i remember raging really hard for then a shade i actually like this tune but keep the energy flowing boy felt like we just got going again the gin is beautiful lot of layer and followed by a well executed peak then the follow possum wa roaring and the crowd go nut i think possum is becoming the new maze or maybe just the better executed tune the way they held the tension before roaring that release wa really well done also look at dick possum from 17 and bd the bouncing it seemed to me like trey had a hard time with bouncing slave wa a good encore tho the slave build especially wa really well done i thought i’d take those 2 to end a show on most night but the best of the encore for the run is yet to come overall i think my biggest complaint about this one is the flow but a i mentioned before the gem in here will hold up and i will definitely relisten to a good amount of this show just a hair short of 4 0 for me rating is a little low imo currently 3 56 mine 3 7 i had a blast at this show they re all super fun right but it just wasn’t the hose note me being extremely tired during this show could have affected my opinion long day of travel 3 hour of dancing definitely wore me out 12 29 18 wow what a night set 1 highlight of the set include everything from buried alive city followed by a nice breather and the ya where s the love for party time guy the buried alive wa rocking followed by a in and out blaze on i thought this version wa good fishman pushed the band with good pace to a decent peak and included a a good funk rhythm section the sloth f k yes nsfw i’ve been waiting for this one played only 5 time since i started seeing phish the energy in the building wa nut for this one me and my buddy were power rocking and just totally enthralled by the energy this classic tune brang to the garden i thought the 46 day wa an especially good jam with a slinky segue into the city trey working his magic with the bm d switch and the band all together wa locked in after 46 day started to liftoff next up the ya mar i love this goofy song and got a little plinko ey just before coming to a smooth close although we first miscalled it for wave at the time sorry people next to u we’re scrub finally the only thing that can compete with the is this time sequence the wolfman s started strong and found really nice space in a minor key followed by more exploration the vocal jam wa a makeup call imo from mansfield 16 when the sound cut out thanks boy and wa really cool interweaved with party time just the band again showing u that they’ve been practicing and i thought they were just in tune the whole set giving room for every band member to thrive in their moment also i’ll note that the band change were clean and smooth all set this theme will continue throughout the run but i felt this wa on 12 28 after set 1 are the boy going to be able to keep the energy up for all 4 quarter set 2 highlight of the set include the whole dang thang i have been caught a few time in just moment of this feeling it’s awe and disbelief and appreciation for what this band can do even though it is hard to describe we all know what it is jam night powder night 12 30 16 are some of mine that tweezer had me jaw to the floor when it came back and with a strong extra 7 minute the carini find a nice jam and peak but is just cut a little short and shadowed by other monster in this set namely the tweezer is just an amazing jam with good diversity and i think the kasvot song fit in there perfectly when they brought it back you could just feel the entire garden go nut similar the way disease came back from melt during the dozen imo then the no quarter wa a nice breather led zeppelin felt like a breather woah i’ll take that in the ballad slot every night tube is a great ending dare i say perfect to an phish set with the 2001 being slightly extended at the beginning and a longer set of peak first opinion haven’t compared time thoroughly though let me note here again that the band segue were really clean a they just slinked from one song to the next all set and all night note i liked the woo section here but i wish it stopped here i feel like they were asking for it all weekend let just get back to stop start jamming but i digress encore wa good not great again i love the make every song you sing your favorite tune lyric and it wa appropriate for the night followed by the greatest 4 minute of rock and roll and absolutely stunning night of phish wa capped off overall i thought tonight wa a barn burner everyone wa talking about 12 30 being the night or 3rd night of the run being the best but let u not forget that phish is the band of ultimate regret and they’ll make you pay for missing a sleeper night i’ll hold off on making any sort of 97 comparison for now but this show deserves being discussed for a long time a will the next 12 30 18 yee with little faith the boy come back strong set 1 this set just felt like the show from last night hadn’t stopped the band came out with the energy to kill it and top yesterday the crowd went absolutely wild for alumnus jimmy page i didn’t even hear the hot dog day ref because everyone wa belting the lyric show 35 and still checking off some heavyweight box that wa a cool first for me with bliss and billy breathes im 1 song away from seeing the entire album other highlight of the set include the and the no sequence mike’s kept the crowd movin and i think it’s got some good segment in there glide ii wa interesting to see only time played but definitely cooled the mood of a very exciting crowd if i didn’t talk enough about clean segue already in my last review we’ll talk some more this is sweet af and total for 20 min of focused jamming more clean segue and tease to come out of the no man and honestly this no man s is nothing to skim over really get into some really nice peaking feat trill from trey towards the end tube love this song then they start jamming the tube f n right real smooth easy listening on this echoplex based groove again feeling like they’ve really pieced together an awesome selection for a set 1 then holy shit are that weekapaug coming back from forever ago welcome to mashup weekend i guess but when it went back into the blue breakdown of tube that’s when the garden erupted this one wa a woah one of my favorite part of the set and honestly the show set 1 is the new set 2 tonight wa really hot p thank for for the bathroom break in more guy i can’t stress enough how much that wa needed back just in time for the numberline solo set 2 highlight of the set include cool amber all the way thru light and the melt the caam got a good 3 min ish extension and i thought it jammed really well everything s right a little down tempo but i also thought that song got into a good groove and go for a solid 15 the diversity of jamming during this 3 song sequence is really good trey really roar during this light i thought for sure this wa going to be the set highlight with everythings right at a close second but yee with little faith there is more to come after an appropriately placed velvet sea mike start up the melt bassline cue crowd eruption this jam might be the best of the run this tweez 7 for me it wa just simply inappropriate with no regard for any well being it got nicely blissed out briefly before turning dissonant and dark with ck5 putting on a dang ole clinic with those light a boy this encore might be the best i’ve ever seen live the entire arena wa just went of control with the band popping off 4 awesome closer which i think could have any of them could have stood alone in that slot just fine the funky bitch wa fun and the crowd wa ready for a wilson i went to grab my flannel like twice thinking surely it s over after the funky bitch and wilson but yee with little faith wow the energy in msg for these song wa something special to be a part of then rocky top come on and somehow it seems like people are raging even harder no reaching for my flannel this time fuck my coat cavern start up and here we go one last dance also i giggled at the faceplant into rock quote they decided to end this one the right way another perfect ending to an absolutely amazing show after a lot of relistening i am currently holding this show slightly higher than the last the diversity of jamming more bust out the 3 set 2 monster and the 4 song encore are hard to compete with but it still such a toss up dang ole phish putting on a dang ole clinic man the last 2 night might be the strongest 1 2 punch in a very long time so i m not counting powder jam or magna although those are interesting conversation peak phish lady and gentleman everyone win i’ll hold off on making any sort of 97 comparison for now but this show like the last deserves being discussed for a long time 12 31 18 a fitting cap to the run fall 18 set 1 highlight of the set include and the antelope honorable mention for the vocally harmonized section of as handed lol classy guy first half of the set wa good very start the night off funky lawn boy come up and might i mention what a nice shirt page had on the steam wa good not great but had good direction then into chalkdust the crowd just went wild i felt this one wa especially energetic behind stage looking out at the band floor for this one and they even tossed in a little second jam after finishing the cdt is this becoming a trend i like it honorable mention for fish pushing the band to a quick peak a la 95 before what s the use silence the building in a good way then trey sings u to sleep with waste see coco monkey meme which i thought wa an okay breather did i mention that i really like the kasvot song see previous review both stray dog and play by play i had a lot of fun with and i think they fit great in the set cap it off with a well executed antelope no problem set 2 here is where the meat of the show really lie highlight of the set include dwd a confused look from mike during farmhouse seven below and the hood all are worth a relisten and even the twist wa good but there wa no time for more i wa utterly surprised with the farmhouse call after a great disease with good direction which you can t say for all of em but after that 7 the band tell me to shut up and keep quiet a they get really creative and deep on this track this jam might be top 3 of the run for me i m usually a fan of woos but this is the first time ive considered it stale i will agree with others that it killed the motif prior but the band wa asking for it for now i d rather hear a regular start stop jam honestly this twist is nothing special it will be overlooked but perfectly placed the hood i thought wa really good almost going to plinko land then went into passing through i’m torn on this i like the tune and the attempt to segue in and out but i think it might ve been better if they played them separately they did end up coming back with a good finish to the hood which wa magical i forgot they hadn t finished at the time but not super sold on this one hard to say either way the band wa flexing their muscle with this one showing cohesiveness and good practice hour once again shiny gem of the set is definitely the 7 imo with the dwd at a close second this set get a 4 1 from me would be much higher if the farmhouse just came after the seven below set 3 highlight of the set include mercury santos some really sweet lick from trey and mike throughout the mercury and it wa just awesome to see the guy having so much fun with santos i think i wa smiling this whole set i loved the gag the light were great streamer everywhere just super fun and honestly that mercury jam will hold up watching mike and trey fly through the air just having a blast watching mike air walk the goofy balloon dancer space smell pretty damn good the simple got ripcorded but one of my friend wisely said sia demand it and it s pretty much on par for the course it’ll take a lot more than that to make me salty right now were all great fun choice the only two bad ripcord we really got all weekend wa the farmhouse the and sia so count your win also we got to witness another couple account of the fabled bob weaver after you play me lizard you can play whatever you want cliche or not that wa a rocking zero i’ll keep this one brief because i wrote some lengthy one prior but all in all i just thought this wa a great cap to 2018 and what a strong run fall tour ha been so fun and energetic after the cancellation thank you all for being amazing even the bad show were still awesome and have song that have replay value eternal joy and never ending splendor keep adding more chapter to the book pham

1,this is ridiculous ok guy so i have a bunch of phriends who love phish and i always used to be so confused a to why they loved them so much they would see show after show recommend 5 version of the same song at once i just wrote it off a petty adolescent phase like those people in high school who just would never stop talking about the grateful dead but didn’t really know a thing about them then it happened 12 31 18 my first phish show now i had listened to phish very casually for month before hand just trying to see what the big deal wa and i couldn’t put my finger on it i never thought they were bad in fact i could recognize they were amazing musician with amazing chemistry but still could not understand the obsession we won the ticket lottery so we had very good seat just off the left side of stage i could practically smell mike a he walked on stage the band walked out joint were getting lit dos were getting eaten and an absolute unmistakable atmosphere of love wa in the air i could feel the energy of the crowd pulsing through my system it wa remarkable but then oh boy and then that first lovely groove came out it ironically enough wa the first phish song i had ever heard a few year before the unmistakable groove of the moma dance i started bobbing my head i couldn’t control it what wa happening it’s not stopping i’m starting to dance i don’t dance what is going on right now i thought before i know it i wa feeling my beer and the little bit of blow we had been keying in the bathroom beforehand and i wa jamming chalk dust came on and i wa going insane moving and grooving in way i would never do if not in the company of all of you lovely judgement free phans a my crew and i met up with all of our phriends after set 1 i couldn’t stop asking what the name of song were asking why they hadn’t brought me here sooner dwd farmhouse wa magical i wa at utter peace with myself this band ha me dancing and sweating one minute and the next reflecting on life and wondering if i’m going to cry then mercury al s a n t o s i had never felt more alive this band ha consumed my life in this past week everyday i listen to my show i listen to phish almost 24 7 driving phish working phish playing video game phish with friend phish sitting around doing nothing phish i love this community and can’t wait to see what this amazing band ha in store for me thank you for reading and i hope to see some of you at a show

1,phish headlining bonnaroo mean fuck all of the southeast in particular for any possibility of a summer tour god i hate bonnaroo’s distance clause is it time for curveball 2 electric boogaloo yet
1,u gen z phans are stoked for bonnaroo seeing the lineup today my jaw hit the floor not just because there are some solid solid act that i ll love but also because there are some great act that while not my cup of tea my friend psyched for i m hyped to see phish jrad hozier mac demarco etc but it s important to recognize that act like childish gambino and odeza are highly respectable among more modern fan again like i assume most of you not my cup of tea but you should still be able to appreciate the artistic merit of them they re not a low effort personality like cardi b yeah that one s an l the point being there s merit in connecting fan from two seemingly opposite side of the spectrum hip hop and jam each get to be excited and enjoy their favorite but also be exposed to new stuff and at best learn they love the sound or at worst get a greater appreciation for a different style of music is bonnaroo filled with an epic line up of jam no but i think it s something much greater than that a balance if you exclusively want a weekend full of jam then we are lucky to have those available to u and conversely for hip hop or edm but banaroo is offering something different with a high potential for greatness and i for one am excited to share the phish experience with those who would never otherwise
1,bonnaroo saturday late night jrad deluxe what will trey and fish do with their off night

1,bonnaroo 12 setbreak music figured i d listen back to the 2012 bonnaroo show to decide for myself if it wa a good idea last time around read a comment on live phish that wa pretty funny and wanted to see if anyone could chime in that wa there bonnaroovian joe 6 18 2012 i heard a lot of people hating on this show but i m not sure why tweezer wa monstrous and kenny wa awesome i wa at this show and wa wondering if anyone else there heard this too right after they walked off what stage for the intermission music started playing like usual about 5 second after it started someone next to me said this is phish and i listened and instantly knew he wa right there s no mistaking their sound i would know it anywhere we listened and it sounded like a new song wa going on every 45 second abruptly almost like when you re flipping through a radio and i thought i heard part of a radiohead song and a dispatch song and a red hot chilli pepper song all band who also played bonnaroo what i think happened wa phish went backstage picked up instrument and played clip of everyone else s song who were at bonnaroo with them then came back on stage and finished the show i told some phriends this hypothesis and they think i m crazy but i know what i heard there s not a doubt in my kind it wa them and if anyone would ever do something like that let s be honest it phish i haven t been able to find a recording of the intermission anywhere though can anyone else vouch for hearing this peace and love a phellow phan

1,for those asking where to stay at alpine they shut camping on the ground after a gd show in 85 86 when their fan were disrespectful to the surrounding farm and home and camped out in yard break in open drug use etc it s an extremely conservative county and they had enough two summer ago alpine opened up camping on the ground during a dmb show a a test run to see how it went my husband and i camped there and although it wa chad central and run a lot like any other festival wristband etc i think alpine and the local sheriff were very happy with how it went so i wouldn t be surprised if they later announce camping pass for purchase i know the local municipality drug it s foot in approving it for dmb so while i don t necessarily think it will happen it is a possibility it wouldn t hurt to contact the venue and show interest

1,psotd 110 mike s song well another week is beginning and what a fun one it should be i ve been kind of drifting aimlessly in the themeing of these email for a little so i figured it s time we got a little structure i d like to welcome you all to mike s week or ten day or however long i feel like i can stretch this out for we re going to start with mike s song and end with weekapaug groove all the song in the middle will be version that were in fact played in between the two song should be fun let s begin mike s song debuted on and clearly is written and sung by mike gordon mike s song debuted with no name the band called it microdot or mike wrote that for a bit before simply referring to it a mike s song the song tell a brief story of a trip mike took where he learned a lot about himself for the first year of it existence the song wa played on it s own and would occasionally springboard into other improvisational phish tune early version were melodic with the first darker version appearing in 1987 dissonance didn t really show up until 1989 in the summer of 1988 mike s song began to be routinely played a the first song in a trio of song mike s am groove this would come to be known a mike s groove while mike s song doe appear solo sometimes it is incredibly rare mike s song is always performed before weekapaug in it early form mike s song had an opening composed section that launch into a jam but the jam would end with another composed section that wa led off by page check out for an example of in early 1989 some chord were added to the beginning of the concluding composed section of the song these chord would be used to mark the transition between the first jam segment the tramp segment and the second jam segment these tramp segment closing chord typically proceed trey s playing of the first note of simple trey wa playing these note in this spot even before simple wa composed in 1994 in order to hear this we ll compare which ha the single jam segment that end with the original closing chord only with which ha a single jam segment that concludes first with the tramp segment and then is immediately followed by the original closing chord rather than a second jam segment and which ha one jam segment that end with the tramp segment before jumping into another song in this case simple the second jam segment of mike s song died out on and would not return until when mockingbird foundation board member andrew hitz spoke with trey about bringing it back you can read his account of the incident in blog post from 1989 to 1994 mike s song contained a dark sinister and semi dissonant jam in the early to mid 90 s mike and trey often performed this jam while jumping on trampoline this is where the name tramp segment come from here s some of it from up until 1993 mike s song wa usually followed by i am hydrogen 1994 saw the creation of simple and that would routinely take the place of hydrogen over the year many song would take the spot in between mike s song and weekapaug and that s what we re going to explore this week and maybe even next week too if you re wanting to take a deep dive into phish s growth a musician there s no better way to do it than to check out the various mike s song s throughout the year there s simply too many version for me to begin to list if you want a springboard go ahead and check out the jam for now i guess i ll leave with the aforementioned 2015 08 04 version statistic mike s song wa played at 28 49 of live phish show it wa last played november 3 2018 which wa 0 show ago there have been 1 798 show since the live debut mike s song ha been played approximately once every 3 5 show since it debut mike s song ha been played on average once every 3 5 show it wa played 518 time

1,trey solo show underwhelming i love trey a much a the next guy 25 yr blah blah but i felt like sung alone the song just seemed pretty flat and mildly boring especially lyrically other than miss you and maybe strange design i felt like there were a dozen unknown songwriter in my city singing more meaningful and musically interesting song at that very moment i ve always been very content with phish s silly random lyric but in that setting they kinda seemed extra dumb back them up with kick as phunk and of course they fall right into place i think most folk at the show were pretty happy with it and in spite of my judgment i still loved seeing trey and getting to hear at least one great story anyway i haven t heard much chatter about these solo show so i thought i d venture an opinion and find out how many people agree and or hate me party on and check this out

1,the floor a pretty neat umphrey s song a terrible place for a phish show i went to vega night 3 4 and wa i thought fortunate enough to score a floor ticket for night 3 what i experienced wa some of the most shameful and embarrassing display of entitlement i have ever witnessed and this is coming from someone who grew up male middle class and white worst of all may have been the territorial display i witnessed coming from some member of the phellowship of which i am a member myself folk who boast of having and practicing spiritual principle such a acceptance in their life their behavior wa not a good look for the phellowship in a general sense not only were a large number of fan on the floor territorial a if in some truly meaningful and life affecting turf war many were downright hurtful and violent i saw significant verbal abuse and even a bit of violent physical interaction i know there is the big debate on claiming space but at the end of the day this behavior and mentality ha no place at an event such a a phish show fortunately i wa able to find a spot with a few friendly and peaceable fan and did not let the handful of rude sad human ruin the experience those kind of folk can make what should be a joyous occasion legitimately uncomfortable for others and that is unacceptable these are just observation coupled with my opinion night 4 i sat in the stand and the overall vibe and comfort level wa countless time better

1,who here find the kasvot röxt set a striking meditation in death just off the top of my head the album is a concept album about death and becoming a ghost turtle in the cloud shadow follow toward me a i wander along the shoreline past the people everything is hollow bright white light shining right between my eye we are come to outlive our brain everything’s overlapping the future to the past thing we are only passing through we re vapor light and liquid blue say it to me santos this is what space smell like death don’t hurt very long obviously the title play by play down below my foot last forever dark and scary i hope someone notice sweet longing freeze time the shape become unhinged
1,kasvot vax get exponentially better the more time you listen to it at least in my opinion i thought it wa okay the first time around but subsequent listens have me hoping to hear all of these song in rotation if you weren’t a fan of vasvot vox from your first listen you should really give it another shot
1,what an inspiring band phish is after last night s second set and the run in general i feel really inspired this band constantly is on to something else something new something a bit different than anything it ha ever done just never resting on their laurel and we are the beneficiary of that insatiable drive that they have it make me want to push a bit harder find a way to get better at whatever i do it s fun while the show is on but the affect that this band ha on u it s truly a special thing and it s something for which i m incredibly grateful

1,last night’s encore i wa really expecting to hear something big like a yem or lizard but it seemed fitting that they ended with a song from both story of a ghost and billy breathes they played a lot of song off those album this tour and i think it wa celebratory of a pivotal moment in their career

1,i m curious what s your top 5 jam of fall 2018 y all probably watched listened to more of the fall tour then me buuut that won t top me from listing my top jam i ve heard from this tour i had a great time listening to these jam and it wa hard to decide what to pick these are in no particular order 1 the albany 20 year later being the tour opener i didn t expect there to be such a standout jam this early especially one so chaotic and evil great work all around 2 the hampton golden age this is a jam that turned beautifully ambient it sound like this jam take a few minute to get to liftoff but once it did i wa swimming in ambience 3 the nashville scent and subtle sound this jam is just a ton of fun if you get the chance watch the free stream of it on youtube trey teasing runnin through the jungle cross eyed and party time were alot of fun to watch unfold the audience wa feeling it alot 4 the chicago no man in no man s land i think this is still the longest jam of the tour it move through some more familiar space before landing on a mike led jam that is weird jarring and funky page also stand out in this jam reminds me of the bd asihtos in this part 5 the vega mercury this jam is the freshest of the bunch but when i listened to it the day after it happened i knew it wa special the jam here move fluidly and cohesively one interesting thing to note is how they subvert the usual peak of the jam earlier than usual and wind down to ambience slowly ala a 12 30 97 acdc bag which eventually lead to a suzy really killer stuff
1,redeemed my code but show only appears in the io app i logged onto to listen to my show but the show isnt appearing in my stash when i load it up in a browser am i doing something wrong
1,shout out to all the people helping out i’ve dragged my wife to a few show and she almost always ha a good time but she’s not exactly a phan she still tease me about my nerdy obsession with the band and think their jam are a little too much bleep boop bop bleep bop boop but she know i love it and support my interest even if she doesn’t totally get it this weekend she watched both of our kid while i went out and had my face melted at mgm so i just wanted to give a quick shout out to her and all the other partner watching kid or the dog or my pet cat so their significant others can get down with the band in person thank you for helping u get our fix of bleep boop bop bleep bop boop
1,first timer s phishy poetry night 4 vega prelude i attended my first phish show tour closing show in vega this past saturday from the moment i entered the energy wa palpable and i could only think in poetry i let it build but by set break it wa overflowing in out and around me so i had to release some of it so what happened after that is below thanks note app i m sharing for two reason 1 the encouragement of one particular phishy friend and 2 because i felt incredibly safe in the magical space we all shared so i m hopeful this too is safe to everyone who wa in it with me thank you i feel you i feel me i get it night 4 man hope to flow with you in there again real soon p s anyone else write phishy poetry can we be phriends some phishy poetry it s set break eye drop marveling connecting laughing set one wa falling in love bringing u to oneness everyone think set two will take u beyond galaxy we’re floating here let’s go if i plug in i can twirl a far a frequency fly sway with the flow is the way that you do i can and you can too i can only think in poetry right now surrender holding any one person energy for too long here would just be selfish gluttony honor the space find your beta and weave magic around it almost too afraid to absorb from all my sens what’s beyond there is no right only curiosity love should feel like the closing set of night 4 feel so good to let go say how you feel safe for the first time at phish so we jumped he didn’t beam me up he helped me realize i’m already in it we’ve all been in it this whole time wading for transcendence melting our soul one chord at a time letting u drift just far enough before bringing u back always bringing u back until we are swimming in the velvet sea slowly picking you off the floor little by little until suddenly there you are jumping again reaching far building up only to split you open up all over again melt melt melt melt love can be no matter how far you go you’re here found myself in the velvet sea all awareness in on what will be so let go let everything melt away sway off into the bay let the moment float right on by loop back in and you’ll see why let go let go let go go go go _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ final thought post show i ve been living a though we can only go up from down so wrong i wa since galaxy are first found within
1,were the mgm show the best of 2018 have not watched or listened better than hampton or alpha from the summer
1,ptbm didn t scan need advice i need some advice from the phish community i sold my 2 vega ptbm to someone for 40 it wa super last minute it wa basically sell to him or eat the cost entirely i met the guy he seemed totally legit and like an actual phan he emailed me right around the show opener to tell me that neither ticket scanned the venue thought he wa selling fake ticket since he had 2 of them they took the ticket from him and kicked him out of the venue obviously i have no way of knowing if this is true or not but my gut tell me he s not just trying to get his 40 back he drove way out of his way in los angeles to get the ticket which seems like a pain in and of itself but my question is ha anyone had this experience where ptbm ticket didn t scan i didn t post the ticket online anywhere so there s no chance anyone could have faked the barcode or whatever second question is who can i reach out to on phish s end to try and recoup the cost for the original ticket assuming what the guy said if they really didn t scan i d like my original money back just curious to see what the community think about this thanks

1,vega split open and melt wa a ghost ship so a few year back i read a tweet i believe it wa from wooketteproblms comparing a melt jam to the sound of two old wooden ship crashing into each other since then every time i ve seen a melt i ve closed my eye during the jam and imagined myself on the deck of an old wooden ship a it hit stormy sea swaying back and forth trying to maintain balance a the rough sea toss the ship every which way a the jam get darker and darker eventually the ship crash into another ship or crash into the shore god i would love a soam shipwreck soam or what have you usually no survivor anyway during the vega melt the wave were getting rough a huge swell descended and all of a sudden there wa another ship directly in front of u no getting out of the way certain doom i braced myself for the inevitable but when the two ship met ours passed right through it wa a ghost ship i love this band so much
1,thought from my vega run i decided to stay in vega for an extra day partially so i could literally just lie in bed in an air conditioned room and recover and partially because flight out of vega on monday morning were way cheaper and i wrote down some thought i had from the run 1 the biggest thing i kept coming back to during the run wa the shift away from the telegraphed white light peak not that i don’t love the build into a glorious peak and not that they didn t have a few of those but some of my favorite jam from the run didn’t follow that template i guess that’s part of the egalitarian jamming i wa hearing about i listened to a lot of the tour but it wa reaaaally noticeable live i think the tweezer from n1 wa where i really felt it first and a lot of my favorite jam had this patient and exploratory vibe that didn’t have a detour into a major key change and a bliss peak it might not be the full return to evil phish that i crave but i’m super into it 2 holy shit the kasvot vaxt set wa insanely catchy live i found myself singing along to every song by the time they finished walking around vega i heard almost every song being sung randomly but this is what space smell like death don’t hurt very long and we are going to outlive our brain seemed to be what i heard most often can’t wait to see which of these track get the regular rotation call 3 trey kept doing this thing where he’d deliver a lyric just a beat off and his phrasing would be a little late or delayed or something weird 4 for the first time in 3 0 i noticed fishman flub more than i did trey flub fishman wa still the mvp of a lot of jam but he used to be the bedrock you could always count on while trey would be the one to forget how to play the sugar shack solo 5 it s been said before but ck5 is on another level right now i wa floor for n1 and n2 lower bowl for n3 and upper bowl for n4 and no matter where i wa the light were fucking insane 6 vega is the worst but also the best it s the perfect amplifier to take a phish run and blast it off into the stratosphere but holy shit is that city the seventh circle of hell 7 favorite jam before a full run re listen tweezer wolfman’s chalkdust blaze on nminml mercury soul planet dwd sally tube carini sas 8 favorite moment when they dropped into half time funk during the chalkdust jam the get down wa real in my section during that jam

1,psotd 99 mercury welcome back the chaos that consumed my life over the last 24 day or so ha now been replaced with the soothing familiarity of routine and order how doe that affect you well it mean you ll be getting psotd at your regularly scheduled interval again i think i ll be going back to the animal song well at some point but for now i m just going curate the list a i see fit also tomorrow will be psotd 100 and i ll release the list of all the song i ve done in case any of you want a re release anyway a promised here s mercury mercury debuted on in a kind of strange first set that included the phish debut of mike gordon s how many people are you page s heavy rotation and tab s scabbard mercury is written by the ever faithful writing team of trey and tom mercury wa conceived with a batch of song that would go on to be big boat ultimately mercury would end up on the cutting room floor fortunately for u it still make rotation musically the song is a multi part composition with kind of prog rock influence the song date to a writing session in kitty hawk nc near where the wright brother took their first flight it took trey several week to add all the music and it s taken the band some time to let the song loose into the improvisational beast it ha become when asked about the song tom marshall said i ve always liked mercury the planet the god the element and decided it needed a tribute that s exactly what we got unlike phish song of old that contain nonsensical lyric all of mercury is fairly well researched mercury is referenced frequently throughout the song some of those way are in relation to the planet the time it take to rotate the sun and it s color other reference allude to the element the wing said to be on the foot of the roman god mercury are referenced the red queen in the song is a reference to the mayan noblewoman whose remains were discovered covered in vermilion powder inside a hidden sarcophagus in 1994 homer s the odyssey recount the story of vulcan trapping his unfaithful wife venus in a netting of unbreakable chain mercury say that he d still happily sleep with her if he could even if it resulted in him being tied up in three time a many chain the unbreakable net in the song manages to evoke a sense of safety and security in 2015 mercury wa played three time on mercury wa played with a four and a half minute jam up from the 90 second one that occurred at it s debut the song would then be shelved for a calendar year returning at dick 2016 the song would still end up making four appearance that year 2017 saw three attempt at mercury we re currently in the dawn of mercury with six attempt so far in 2018 and i bet we ve got one more taboot the song is usually found in the second set although it s not uncommon to see it in the first twenty five percent of the time the song is played it is followed directly by light today we re going to look at the very and most recent version roll stats statistic mercury wa played at 0 88 of live phish show it wa last played november 2 2018 which wa 1 show ago there have been 135 show since the live debut mercury ha been played approximately once every 113 6 show since it debut mercury ha been played on average once every 8 4 show it wa played 16 time also after listening to pretty much nothing but phish since my release last february i am slightly phish ed out obviously this won t affect the email but i need something else to listen to so i m seeking suggestion of non jam band based music i failed to post a single fall tour show for you guy but i ll make up for it by posting the whole tour right now it can be found and and countdown non jam band concert i m attending 19 day first nye show 50 day nye 53 day

1,halloween 2018 highlight from my favourite new record since undermind to the heartfelt and emotional thank you from fishman on n3 i felt the magic last week i no longer have a curveball sized hole in my head and i hope the band doesn’t either new all time favourite version of tune soam hood mercury blaze on and first tube best jam literally all of them wa there a song they jammed it wa sick top tier 3 0 jamming bet on it likely unpopular opinion night 3 wa the pound for pound best phish show all year my heart melted a bit when trey said this feel like an old show before proceeding to crush that good time bad time screaming through fucking space that night could smell it coming from the opening bar of cavern what a run further highlight trey on the white strat strutting around ripping solo like an absolute rockstar gordo jumping off the drum riser like an absolute rockstar fishman twerking and dancing on the grand piano reminding u that he is still indeed too hot for the hot tub paige new shoe goofin’ fuzzy white monitor ck5 getting the light to look like dice slowly rolling and the pyramid he wa building on night 3 and of course the transformer spider shape throughout if i could bust out trey slayed the jam and a single tear rolled down my cheek i love that song and into weigh had me grinning like a cheshire cat my buddy getting his 46 day request from the band for his 365th show on night 4 just a few week after his 46th birthday the amount of savage ny state doh water inspector costume on halloween the mgm staff maybe they’ve had a rough october until we arrived that one ufc event wa no joke but they seemed extra chill this year you people see you next summer
1,it would have been funny if phish put a fairly well known song in the kasvot växt set it would have made u think the most popular version of that song is a cover for a little bit and it would have in a weird convoluted way made the kasvot växt schtick that much more believable
1,longest phish show what s the longest gig phish ha ever played
1,funny poster story i wa just reminded of sorry it s a wall of text here s a story i thought you guy might appreciate event though it s mostly jerry garcia related i follow an account on twitter tigerrose420 that tweet great rare photo of jerry and the dead she had one there today that looked really familiar and got me to thinking let me take you back to 1993 i had already seen phish at the spectrum in toronto and wa a phan and already a big gd fan i wa teaching english in tokyo and learned there would be an exhibition of original jerry garcia water colour and sketch etc in a big department store called parco for phish context that s also where i bought my cd copy of both junta and lawn boy and wa studiously learning all the ingredient to reba s phinest creation cut to exhibition day i go way downtown after work in my suit to a giant department store near shibuya called parco think macy s or bloomingdales i enjoy the very small but interesting art show of jerry s in a few place throughout the store are these ginormous promotional poster of jerry with lot of japanese written on them i really want one a a memento so i start asking around to the staff to see how i could get one they basically couldn t didn t wouldn t understand what i wa asking or what i wanted and kept saying no not for sale picture a foam core backed poster board maybe 3 foot by 5 foot i keep asking for manager supervisor who is in charge and who can help me nothing so in a moment i m not particularly proud of but sort of i literally take one off the wall and make a bee line for the exit you have to picture an almost six foot tall white guy well dressed in a suit taking stuff literally off the wall in a japanese department store and running i quickly make for an exit get outside and duck into the nearest store and hurriedly request a garbage bag which i managed to get of course it doesn t fit inside because it s so big so the top of his head is sticking out of this bag i get on a very very packed train with this thing and commute 2 hour back home when it came time to leave japan i wanted that poster but there wa no way i wa going to backpack through thailand with it so i very carefully and meticulously spent my evening gingerly peeling the poster from the foam core backing then i rolled it up and shlepped it through thailand for a month and ultimately back to canada flash to today i see a similar image start googling find what i m looking for and that s my story i have no idea where it is today tldr i stole jerry garcia poster in japan 25 year ago from the same store where i first bought junta and lawnboy

1,reflection on halloween and 3 0 so halloween ha since past and there seems to be an ominous theme emerging across the horizon this year costume set wa their best yet a set that left everyone more than satisfied while trolling the fan base with one of their quirky joke kasvot växt i rokk wa perfect an imagined band a ghostly album a per the phishbill a whole set of not quite phish phish but it’s very telling what i noticed about this set is that the band is once again steering into a more creative direction so what’s next for phish what’s next for halloween why doe it matter let’s start with the last question first it doesn’t matter the band ha clearly found where they want to be a for future halloween’s i’m not holding out for zeppelin or zevon anymore they’ve gone from the kid that trick or treat in superhero costume to insanely original design of their own my guess is that they’ll play themselves again one year but something different like tmwsiy but maybe a parallel senior thesis of sort a for the band nothing but good thing in their future a long a they steer clear from shady investment and the lure of the backstage environment they’ll be doing this for a while

1,psotd 101 happy birthday to you the idea of celebrating your birth date is a pagan tradition many christian didn t celebrate birthday historically because of that pagan thought that evil spirit lurked on day of major change like the day you turn a year older starting around the 19th century one date of birth wa regarded a something worth celebrating and the ritual of birthday began to spread the song associated with the birthday tradition is an entirely different animal the 1893 songbook song story for the kindergarten included a song called good morning to all written by the louisville sister mildred and patty hill a man named robert coleman came along changed the lyric from good morning dear child to happy brithday dear name and claimed ownership the sister would sue win and began claiming copyright and royalty of their own that wa the end of the dispute sort of in 1935 the summy company registered a copyright to the song happy birthday which is essentially the same thing a happy birthday to you but shorter this kicked off a whole new round of legal battle that wouldn t get all the way settled until 2016 when the court officially ruled the song a public domain by some estimate it is the highest earning single song in history with estimated earnings of 50 million since it s inception way back on however phish debuted for the first time and happy birthday to you closed out the first set phish would go on to perform the song for various people close to the band many time over the course of their career sometimes they play the song traditionally other time they give it a different spin mike ha had two performance of the song dedicated to him on stage 1988 06 03 and 1989 06 03 fishman ha also had two 1991 02 19 1993 02 19 and page ha three performance for him 1991 05 17 1992 05 17 1994 05 17 long time phish set and light designer chris kuroda ha also had three performance of the song in his honor 1991 07 26 1999 07 25 2013 07 26 the 1999 version is particularly notable because it featured a solo from each band member and then a light solo from ck5 himself it doesn t appear that the band itself ha had trey sing happy birthday to well himself however on three occasion the audience did the singing for him 1990 09 29 1999 09 29 and 2000 09 30 other target for the birthday treatment have included a heather erica dimitri wesley and greenpeace dana on 1989 10 06 fishman performed the song including the vacuum for his brother david fishmans father leonard would get the same treatment on 2009 03 08 the tradition continues with the most recent performance coming from 2016 06 25 at wrigley field for their tour manager today we ll check the version where trey had the audience sing the song for his daughter 20th birthday statistic happy birthday to you wa played at 1 16 of live phish show it wa last played june 25 2016 which wa 102 show ago there have been 1 810 show since the live debut happy birthday to you ha been played approximately once every 86 6 show since it debut happy birthday to you ha been played on average once every 86 2 show it wa played 21 time the lyric are well known obviously today is my birthday

1,phishy synchronicity continued i saw the post about the cool coincidence the guy playing had with his character icculus and rift i posted this story in that thread but reliving it just now inspired me to make my own phishy synchronicity post so this is a kind of long one but the payoff is worth it i bought ticket to tahoe earlier in the year off stub hub about a week prior to the event i received email confirmation for both saying the ticket were in the mail second night arriving first first night arriving a day later fucking sweet so i go to my local karaoke haunt a fee day before the show and decide to see if they have any phish it wa slim picking but they had free so i sang it gleefully in anticipation of my tahoe trip the first ticket arrives it s one if the physical ticket too not a ticketmaster ticket so cool can t wait for second one to arrive so i decide to check the tracking and i discover that the seller did not put the ticket in the mail on time and it wa expected to arrive at my house by end of day the day of the show 309 mile away from the venue oh hell no so i call stubhub they are very nice but after about an hour they tell me there are zero more ticket for that night available and all they can do is refund my money but i already took vacation day i booked the airbnb sorry charlie they refunded my money and threw in a 20 credit to ease the blow i m totally deflated sure i can probably find a scalper roaming stateline but i really don t like winging my vacation my coworker who wa overhearing my conversation tapped me on the shoulder you should call ups dude naw stubhub said there wa nothing they could do it s over man you should just call so i call in ten minute the ups guy is able to intercept the package free of charge and i can pick it up at one of their distribution center on my way to the venue so i go to the designated place at the designated time on my way to tahoe and sure enough there s my ticket so now i have a free ticket in my hand a well a 20 credit on stubhub which i used for a free ticket to the forum a few week later i get to tahoe we eagerly wait and wonder what the summer tour opener would be and what do you know they play free

1,psotd 93 today we ll be wrapping up ungulate song and moving on to halloween stuff steam debuted on and is written by tom and trey and sung by trey the first verse come out of an ambience cesspool and into a slow groove that drive the song onward the pressure build toward and out gassing which is followed by some jam space the band claim the song is inspired by a song of ice and fire by george rr martin but overall consensus is that it s obviously a song about the dark tower series by stephen king on multiple occasion the lyric reference the tower a solitary flower and a mysterious man that someone need protecting from anyone who ha read these book can tell you that those are direct reference to the series in 2013 stephen king released the sequel to the shining called doctor sleep and in it these people are feeding off a steam that get emitted when child with the shining are slowly tortured this is enough confirmation for me to conclude that stephen king is a much of a fan of phish a they are of his steam is one of my top 5 phish song released after 2009 the layer effect intricate jam and fantasy lyric in this song just get me there steam can almost always be found a the third or fourth song in the second set it s where it debuted and it s where it ha mostly stayed there have been two first set performance the band is usually good for about four performance of the song a year and we ve already reached that in 2018 so perhaps it won t appear during the halloween run this year piper ha followed steam 21 percent of the time 7 out of 32 performance on we saw a 12 minute and that s what we ll be checking out today here s the from the performance too because they really do a great job of making it look like steam is encapsulating the band statistic steam wa played at 1 76 of live phish show it wa last played september 2 2018 which wa 0 show ago there have been 275 show since the live debut steam ha been played approximately once every 56 7 show since it debut steam ha been played on average once every 8 6 show it wa played 32 time

1,my phish sob story i got into phish back in late 2015 my first show wa supposed to be 7 6 16 in portland me unfortunately i wa injured with a really bad concussion and couldn’t make the show i also had 7 9 16 ticket to hartford and had to skip that show a well my fiancé went to the portland show and i told him to miracle my portland ticket and both of the hartford ticket outside the venue we live right in portland so it didn’t make sense for him to skip that show but he didn’t want to go to hartford without me fast forward to this spring i surprised my fiancé with curveball ticket i don’t really need to go into detail about this because i know many of you experienced the same heartbreak that i did month of planning time off work arranging a dog sitter buying supply driving 19 hour straight round trip all for naught another missed opportunity of seeing my favorite band and then the nye announcement came i put in for the lottery for 12 30 and 12 31 knowing that there’s a good chance i won’t get ticket booked a refundable hotel room for good measure my fiancé’s birthday is 12 29 and this would be his birthday gift from me i owe him big time for introducing me to this band but of course like so many others i got my rejection email last night i’m going to try to battle the ticketmaster machine on friday i’ll be at work so i’m going to plan my lunch break around the on sale time but i’m still expecting to get shut out so if anyone out there got extra ticket or can’t make the show and would be interested in helping this girl see phish for the first time and selling me their ticket to 12 30 and 12 31 you would be an absolutely amazing human being i’ll pay face fee shipping a little extra to make it worth your while i’ve been in love with this band for the last 3 year and have yet been able to see them live i’m starting to believe that the universe ha something against me

1,some thing i d love to see during fall tour despite somewhat of a weird vibe around the scene really mostly on facebook reddit this summer i thought there were definite step forward for the first time since 2009 i think first set were the strong point of summer many show had big first set jam ie alpharetta ghost good song placement ie dick s down with disease in the 1 2 slot rather than the standard 2 1 slot and the introduction of some cool toy this summer more than any other in the 24 year i ve been seeing em i noticed the lack of bust out rarity and one offs from deep in the catalogue can t remember the last time they didn t play scent of a mule during a tour mellow mood wa the only real bustout that i can think of this summer not a big deal just an observation but some song were in really tight rotation for fall i d love for them to continue what they did this summer continue the big first set jam i d like to see maybe a little more variation in setlists maybe more long form jamming and definitely a looser rotation of song with some bust out and rarity tossed in the mix lastly and i know it s a stretch but i d love for trey to use that wah pedal a bit looking forward to the 10 show i m hitting sure to be lot of great moment i m also happy to say that i m keeping my hampton streak alive i haven t missed a single hampton show they ve ever done what are some thing you d like to see them do this fall
1,i can t believe it but your boy hooked a long time hater and i m pretty sure i m a phan now hey guy just thought i d share this with you all on here i m a long time head from a family of head and well i ve never really enjoyed phish because i ve always had this preconceived notion that they were just a goofy weird band and i found the vocal and lyric to be really off putting the few time friend tried to play some phish for me it never really clicked and i can honestly say i wa probably pretty high brow and douchey about it i m a humble enough guy to admit that i wa dead wrong and i feel pretty embarrassed that i ve always looked down on them for some unjustified reason it started month ago when i started a new job were i spend 3 4 hour driving per day it also lined up with me getting unlimited data for my phone and streaming random and new music while driving driving one day blaze on came on and i really dug it it wa followed by possum piper and mellow mood while listening to this new band it put me in such a great mood and my jaw nearly dropped when i got home and checked out the band i ve been listening too i get bad anxiety from a accident year back so i never take my eye off the road it wa phish i wa listening to fucking phish and i fucking loved it i listened to the summer 2015 tour for week falling more in love fast forward to the present day and i ve been listening to phish nearly every day for 3 hour a day all of my previous thought about this band have gone out the window and i ve realized that i just never gave them on honest chance all my thought about vocal and lyric have changed once i realized that the vocal are nothing more then a simple vehicle to propel jam and the music forward every song doesn t need to have deep meaningful lyric and it honesty some of the best music i ve ever heard a bad day at work can easily be fixed within 1 or 2 song i m going to stop my rant here but i get it i get you guy i get the music i get the community and i get the band

1,an interesting data project concept related to nye ticket it would be really neat to actually calculate the true market value of nye ticket over time this wouldn t be possible even on a rough scale without access to about 8 year of mostly complete price record for primary and secondary ticket price attempted number of individual who tried to purchase unsuccessfully and dollar value adjustment it would also be interesting to add thing like adjusted cost of travel and lodging distance travelled to get to the show and s statistic for phans who actually go to multi night run other than nye are there any data scientist or economist who want to weigh in and add remove other category that would be needed to calibrate a model again this isn t something that would be possible given lack of access to data set but it is a neat thought experiment

1,psotd 95 today there s a decent chance that you ll get two email from me so you ll see one phish email yes but will you see it again saw it again is written by trey and tom and made it s phish debut on the song itself wa first performed by new york on 1997 05 21 new york wa a project that featured mike and trey saw it again is a sufficiently song about waking up in the middle of the night with the feeling that somethings in your window in your state of near hysteria you approach the window and see the shape of the being you fear that s when the curtain s blow open revealing your own reflection the music consists largely of heavy bass bomb from mike and ripping guitar from trey to help set the mood of being frightened the song average in at five to seven minute saw it again got a slight refresher from the 2014 chilling thrilling show sound affect a lot of time at the end of the song page will hit the creaking house sound or the sound of a person screaming some other song have received similar treatment with various affect and honestly i kind of like it in it s debut year of 1997 saw it again had seven attempt it wasn t played at all in 1998 1999 2000 and 2003 saw three performance the song wa not seen in 2004 with the return of the band many fan myself included wondered if we d ever see it again the question wa answered on when the band played the song twice and referenced the lyric in five other song during the show from there the song would make it s regular one or two yearly appearance with the exception of 2016 when the song wa played five time saw it again usually can be found in the first set although it s not uncommon for it to be played in the second set today we re going to get fully to the performance i m also going to the most recent attempt because it feature some of the sound affect i wa talking about at the end plus it ha an appropriate clowny quote statistic saw it again wa played at 1 82 of live phish show it wa last played august 10 2018 which wa 5 show ago there have been 688 show since the live debut saw it again ha been played approximately once every 55 show since it debut saw it again ha been played on average once every 20 8 show it wa played 33 time it s worth nothing that i really really like this song nothing like a creepy rocker about a fear of yourself to really set the mood for a deep dive at a phish show i m sure i m not alone in these sentiment but ticketmaster really hurt my feeling

1,the livephish iphone app ha been terrible for a long time yet i keep paying for it don’t get me wrong that livephish even exists is one of the thing i love about the band it show how much they value their fan by giving them what they want the amount of content it offer and knowing that i’ll never have to torrent a show again or suffer through terrible audio quality are thing i’ll gladly pay for it sure a hell beat bringing blank tape and a sase to a show and hoping you find a taper willing to hook you up the app however definitely need some work first of all it’s generally unstable it crash from time to time and just stop play for no reason it also ha pretty much no feature there’s no reason why it shouldn’t offer the same functionality a spotify an equalizer and file size option for wifi and cellar come to mind and finally i can’t think of anything more annoying than a gap between song when you’re trying to listen to a phish show most of the time everything work fine but the problem with the gap keep happening i’ve emailed support like three time to complain about this and the best they can offer is to suggest i delete and reinstall the app a if i hadn’t already tried that doe anyone else have these issue
1,phish thought so i m going to preface this by saying i ve been a long time phan been to about 30 show and have spent considerable time and money seeing and supporting them over the last 15 year my best bud and i were having a really in depth discussion about the way the fan base idolizes the band and this led to some perspective change on a number of issue and i wanted to get some feedback if anyone else ha considered these thing first of all i think a lot of what make up a band the individual personality the ethic the motif and the collective stance get lost on a lot of the fan in the whirlwind of idolatry i am guilty of this a well which is why i m putting this out there it s important to continue to hold your hero to the same standard a your closest friend the first thing that struck me is the prank that trey did in college with the hand and heart regardless of whether it wa a human or goat heart the very notion he would send some severed organ to someone and consider it a joke is troubling and show a lot of privilege it s in such bad taste that if a friend of mine thought to do that and expected me to laugh it off i would cut them right out of my life for good this ha tone of sociopathy and not giving a flying fuck about the deceased and defiling their dignity just think about it on an emotional level would you really think that s an okay thing to do would you just write that off a your friend being their crazy self i would be concerned for their mental health the fact that he still refers to it a a joke make it worse in my view he doesn t see it a a big deal and 30 year to reflect on it hasn t taught him anything about the way people should or shouldn t behave the second thing trey s drug addiction he had every example of what not do to from looking at jerry s life and all the various other artist who went down that path and yet he went right ahead and did it anyway he also wa not faithful to his wife while out on tour and i think some of this attitude came from zappa s way of life which wa also extremely questionable if you look at some of the footage that show zappa hanging out in a house full of groupie and a very young dweezil seemingly being raised by them while on the road it paint a bad picture and explains a lot of the trouble that exists in the zappa family now between dweezil and ahmet zappa wa also completely unapologetic for this lifestyle and while he did manage to accomplish more than almost any other single composer in recent history every other part of his life had to suffer for it i think trey either consciously or subconsciously gleaned some of these trait from zappa and wa himself a victim of idolatry without consideration for the real world implication of these kind of action the only reason he stopped with the heroin is because he wa being extremely careless and got himself arrested otherwise i m not sure he d be alive today either way it show disregard for the consequence to the band and his family which is not something to be admired thirdly i take issue with the fact they are still incessantly touring even at the point where they have won the game and made their million but they aren t pushing themselves to write creatively or get deep into improv like they used to add on top of this the fact they are selling 6k all inclusive resort ticket to mexico and it really make me question what the hell they are doing anymore and what the point is to keep going they all have family now and i m sure whether the family tag along or stay home they would prefer to have their father around more instead of chasing more and more money and a bigger fan base i found big boat to be a definitive statement of the band s lack of trying lately most of the song on there are completely awful and out of character with maybe one or two exception joy and fuego were great example of them finding way to be creative without having to churn out progressive jam opus like in the early day it would be a different story if they decided to play for the benefit of charity like in the mexico show if the proceeds from the exorbitant ticket price went to the surrounding area living in abject poverty but i don t see this a a consideration from them which make me really think it s all about the money at this point and finally it s important to consider what a band push out into the world with their message the more i look at phish song and lyric while many of them are very beautiful and poetic they don t really convey a sense of being in touch with what s going on in the world in fact it seems that with gamehendge and many of the lyric they are mostly focused on fantasy and escapism and directing the listener away from the happening of the world contrast this with robert hunter and the dead they were single handedly carrying a cultural revolution and their lyric are very mindful of what wa happening at the time while also being highly poetic and ethereal jerry also maintained that he and the band shouldn t be followed blindly and treated a god estimated prophet while trey himself ha repeatedly said that if he can help someone forget about the problem in the world for a few hour then he feel he ha done his part i disagree mainly because when you re a big of an influence a he is there is a certain responsibility to engage the listener and encourage them to be mindful and involved in the world rather than escaping it this is reflected in the fact that the first 15 year or so of the band s existence were basically an ever expanding drug party and i think this ha shaped a lot of what the current jam scene lack critical thinking and self awareness it s this kind of environment that birth band like twiddle where they can put in 1 10th the effort of writing music that the dead and phish have and can still become huge and before you jump at the chance to call me a hater really consider the depth of their content and their message if any can you honestly say twiddle stand for something can you honestly say they really try to push anything innovative out there it s watered down derivative millennial jam music with atrocious singing and it wa created on the shoulder of giant by copying their formula overall i think the band ha diverged from my own sense of ethic and while their music will always hold a special place in my heart it feel different thinking of thing in this way i also look back on the thousand and thousand i ve spent following them around and wonder what more productive use i could have gotten from that time and money at the time i wa loving every minute of it and i did make some great memory but ultimately i got swept up in the scene and wasn t thinking towards my future i wa only concerned with how to get to the next show and i think this obsessive attitude is very misguided and doe some subtle damage when you re sorting it out later on it doesn t help that everyone in the scene is concerned with stats and getting more show under their belt than the next guy i don t think this is what it should be about and there are so many criminally under appreciated artist out there trying to make a living why not diversify and support those act a well instead of using all my effort supporting one band that ultimately doesn t even feel the impact of my presence or contribution i don t expect many people to agree with me here these are just the conclusion i have arrived at through a deeper look into their history i m happy to discus any part of this and i m open to information that may prove me wrong on any account cheer

1,welcome to phish a guide for beginner over the year i ve been asked by several friend to help them get into phish and been mostly successful although phish themselves should rightfully take the credit on that on the eve of fall tour 2018 i thought i would compile and edit information and advice from various email i ve sent in this effort hopefully this will be helpful to some of you feel free to hit me up with suggestion or correction if anything seems off here go dear friend i hope this message find you well contained within it is a rather large amount of information but you need not process it all at once you are about to embark upon a fantastical journey and like all good journey there is no right way to go about it a you progress down this rabbit hole my word can act a one guide but you will find that a always your truest guide is your own taste and curiosity also a extensive a this message is it will be impossible to fit in everything so there will be much more to explore in general i would advise not to overthink it too much i know it s hard not get too overwhelmed by the volume of content and just dive in and start swimming to quote their song ac dc let s get down to the nitty gritty let s get this show on the road basic phish is a phenomenal band and i mean that literally there are other jam band and others that they are often compared to but there is only one phish i can say without hyperbole that they are four of the most talented musician and composer out there and i doubt even phish hater would deny their technical chop they would just state that phish us those incredible technical chop to make terrible music but to each their own like any band that s been around for 30 year they have gone through many phase and sound and you ll definitely find one you like better than others a great way to get into phish is to explore both their song and their famous improvisational jam in the live setting the two are usually paired together a song serf a a springboard into an extended jam many song can be best discovered through their studio album which usually forego any long jam their song run the gamut rock to blue to funk to progressive to modern classical they are amazing composer who take inspiration from hendrix zappa the beatles the talking head and many others many of their lyric are very quirky and bizarre and yet if you listen enough you ll probably find many weird truism they re also the world s best cover band they ve covered everyone from the stone to bill monroe to tv on the radio and they always make the song their own in addition they have a longstanding tradition of performing show on halloween in which they don a musical costume and cover a classic album in it entirety beginning in 1994 with the beatles white album and most recently in 2016 doing david bowie s the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spider from mar history phish formed in burlington vermont in 1983 they ve had the same lineup since 1985 trey anastasio guitar jon fishman drum mike gordon bass page mcconnell keyboard their evolution ha been profound and constant with dramatic shift in style across year and even tour generally speaking 94 98 is considered their strongest period but there s greatness to be found across their entire career there are a few hard barrier relating to the hiatus from 2000 2002 and break up from 2004 2009 and much overlap but to roughly summarize their era 1 0 1983 89 formative year from college band to local bar band to regional northeast touring band sometimes loose in jokey and juvenile but with a hunger and energy that clearly point towards something greater 90 92 relentless touring of the national club circuit fast aggressive playing developing a cult following and building a reputation a a must see band 93 96 shifting towards an emphasis on long form improvisation and exploration growing from small club to medium venue then exploding into arena size show the massive influx of fan from the grateful dead scene following jerry garcia s death in august 95 fundamentally changed the atmosphere of show and trajectory of their career 97 2000 more of a focus on funk rhythm texture and groove contains many career highlight including fall 97 aka the phish destroys america tour spring 98 s 4 show island tour and their new year 99 2000 festival at big cypress in florida wherein they welcomed the new millennium by playing a nonstop 7 hour midnight to sunrise set in the fall of 2000 the band announced they were taking a hiatus and stopped playing together until new year 2002 03 2 0 2003 04 return from hiatus colloquially known a the oxy year this era wa the height of drug and the party scene on off and backstage forgotten lyric flubbed composition and mistaken note galore but also some of the most exploratory and emotional jam the beast that wa phish inc became too large and unwieldy to manage and due to a combination of financial issue drug addiction and intra band tension they broke up apparently for good following their coventry festival in 2004 3 0 2009 present in 2006 trey wa arrested in upstate new york for a dwi and wa found to be in possession of prescription opiate he went to drug court and rehab and finished treatment in 2008 becoming an outspoken advocate for compassionate drug law and rehabilitation since shortly thereafter he began writing new music and reached out to the other member of phish to reunite they played their first show of the current era in march 2009 and have been playing consistently since then in term of sound and style this era is marked by a more mature direct and egalitarian approach to improvisation 2015 wa a highlight year with trey joining the living member of the grateful dead for their fare thee well concert and the accompanying practice and focus translated over to phish producing some of their greatest musical moment in recent memory in 2017 they staged the baker dozen a 13 night residency at madison square garden in which each show had a unique setlist with no repeat performing over 230 song over the course of the run music performance the proper format to experience phish is to attend a live show i realize this may be difficult for you in the near future but definitely put it on your to do list if possible find a friend to attend with you but if not don t worry about rolling solo you ll make plenty of friend at the show aside from seeing them live in front of your face there are the recording every phish show is recorded either professionally or by fan and most of these fan recording are with professional equipment and of the highest quality the official place to check these out is soundboard direct from the band and audience recording for all show can be streamed for free at there s also plenty of good stuff on youtube and the like a good place to start with live show is the mid to late 90 96 99 or so they got super funky and melodic then and it ll be really easy to get into from there you can move backwards or forward a you like their studio album are good but are mostly useful for familiarizing yourself with various song and stylistic period my favorite studio album are a follows story of the ghost 1998 hoist 1994 rift 1993 junta 1989 farmhouse 2000 although that s just my personal preference ghost hoist and rift and pretty universally loved by phans junta is their first album and contains some of their best song and farmhouse is kinda poppy divisive but i like it a lot here s the wiki article of their discography also they have active youtube and vimeo account with ton of amazing video one thing you ll probably notice if you haven t already is their light are fucking crazy they always have a massive light rig and the man who s been their lighting designer for 25 year chris kuroda is widely considered to be a pseudo 5th member of the band he is always in sync with them and often us the light to help influence the jam set different mood with color and pattern which the band translates into different key melody and rhythm the video will give you a sense of what i m talking about but seeing it live is definitely the way to go it s pretty uncanny advice recommendation resource so that wa a lot where to go from here here are some resource that will prove invaluable in your research the official site news tour date official release etc the largest phan site encyclopedic collection of setlists song history with recommended performance blog post message board etc free streaming site phish in official youtube and vimeo profile the phish subreddit spotify apple music amazon etc all have large collection of studio album and official live release a i said before your best guide will be your own taste and curiosity a good approach that worked well for me and others i ve brought into the fold is to 1 dive in and listen to a show 2 pick a song you really liked from that show and look it up on 3 pick a recommended version from that song s history 4 listen to that entire show 5 repeat either with another version of that song or another song you liked from that show this way your exposure grows organically and you can appreciate the variation in performance of a single song a well a change in style and sound across year to help you get started here is a spotify playlist full of some of my favorite show a well a their studio album i organized them in an order that i think highlight the diversity of style from each era but feel free to skip around i ll break each show down to give you a bit more guidance 12 1 95 a great starter show the opening frame of buried alive down with disease theme from the bottom highlight phish s ability to manage energy and flow 11 17 97 one of my personal all time favorite almost every song is a highlight and landmark version but especially the tweezer ghost contender for my favorite phish jam ever johnny b goode jam and yem 6 14 00 in 99 and 2000 phish did short tour in japan where they played small club the more intimate setting led to mellower more ambient textural jam the here is legendary rumor ha it the boy drank mushroom tea before this show they were legal in japan at the time 2 28 03 2003 and 2004 comprise what is referred to a phish 2 0 the band broke up briefly from 2001 2002 and 2005 2009 the era prior to the first breakup is 1 0 in between the breakup is 2 0 and the current era is 3 0 phish 2 0 is marked by a darkness more prevalent than in the other era drug use and intra band tension were at their highest level during these year but there are still gem to be found amongst the rough highlight of this show include bird gin tweezer and hood 4 2 98 4 5 98 this run of show is referred to a the island tour since the concert took place in long island and rhode island funky catchy goofy and playful this is peak phish highlight 4 2 twist 4 3 mike s old home place weekapaug 4 3 rose are free jam piper 4 4 bird 2001 and 4 5 disease cavern 7 6 98 similar to their 99 2000 japan run in 97 98 they did a string of small club show in europe this one from prague feature a blistering ghost with a buttery smooth transition into a cover of the talking head city 12 7 97 just an all around great show from start to finish one of the strongest first set they ve ever played with perfect transition in the opening bag psycho killer jjlc an extra funky tube and a gorgeous slave to the traffic light 12 31 95 an epic new year show their second at msg nonstop energy and virtuosity i could list highlight but then i d just type out the entire setlist i also included their studio album junta 1989 lawn boy 1990 a picture of nectar 1992 rift 1993 hoist 1994 billy breathes 1996 story of the ghost 1998 farmhouse 2000 round room 2003 undermind 2004 joy 2009 fuego 2014 and big boat 2016 a well a a live one 1995 which contains curated performance from their 1994 tour arranged to resemble the flow of a real show even though this seems like a lot hopefully this information is helpful and make it a little le overwhelming a ridiculous a it may seem this is only scratching the surface and i had to edit my choice down a lot i didn t even provide you with anything pre 1994 and some of the best stuff is in 90 93 when they were so young and hungry i also didn t include any 3 0 show on the playlist but those are worth exploring a well fall 13 summer 14 summer 15 and summer 17 are all excellent tour definitely listen to all of their 2015 festival and the 2017 msg residency the baker and i didn t even mention i m always happy to guide you more so let me know what you re digging good luck happy phishing and whatever you do take care of your

1,am i listening to a different dick night 3 than everyone else i m a little confused me and my small crew were geeking out sunday night second set at the slow pace phish found similar to the from n1 that i thought kind of turned that whole 46 into some of my favorite phish of this summer it seems like the majority of the review are pretty negative i thought it wa a good a night 1 and i think night 3 set 2 wa the best set of music of the weekend from to back the slow weird cowbell pace gave way to some creative new type of jamming maybe nothing went 20 minute but i honestly thought the highly lauded night 1 set 2 they went too far out with nothing really to play whereas this night everything seemed to be inspired with the intention of trying something new and different i get if you re a perfectionist and some of the flub or rough part while the band found their groove turned you off but i dont get how you could think the set wa standard the pace out of tweez wa perfect for golden age i usually hate that song but with a slow and funky mike beat holding it down the song wa a completely different animal i also heard essentially a full band manteca tease throughout the age transition maybe it didnt show up on the stream but it just felt extremely unique and not like the let down everyone s making it out to be

1,so i went to phish dick’s this weekend so a the title state i attended phish dick’s this weekend and i sure am glad i did you see i’m a deadhead who never had crossed stream so i figured i would give them a listen and if i liked what i heard i would attend pd well i loved what i heard and bought the ticket to take the ride but the ride got fucking bumpy i wa diagnosed with leukemia last year and it wa obviously a wake up moment but everything wa going well with treatment and we thought we would just cruise into remission so fast forward to phish dick’s week and i get a call from my doc saying that the cancer is worse and we have to go back to the drawing board so test were ordered etc i wa devastated and absolutely fucking wrecked but i wa still looking forward to the show and just spacing out for a few night and i could not have asked for better medicine the show catapulted me into a stratosphere of joy i just remember night 2 watching 2001 and i just couldn’t stop smiling watching all the glow stick flying and the ever moving crowd took me exactly where i wanted to be but i got so much more than just a great show i met so many great people that wanted to make sure i enjoyed myself and the music and at one point i just stood looking at the lot and just fucking cried because of how heavy the positive vibe were and how much i realized i needed this weekend i truly needed these show and this band more than i ever knew but at this point the band and the show were just the cherry on top it wa the people and the community that lifted me up and for that i am forever grateful so i just want to thank you all and say i hope to see you all many many more time on the road thank you for a great end to a hot summer

1,note on attending a phish concert for the first time 1 beautiful weirdo the ethos at a phish concert is come a you are before the show the parking lot of the forum in inglewood where the lakers used to play resembles the set of a fellini movie grafted onto an ancient grateful dead memory all clothing and barbering choice are acceptable smiling at stranger allowed dancing for no reason strongly encouraged people who attend phish concert tend to be uninhibited the absence of inhibition make them beautiful 2 traveling economy a tribe of phish head tour with the band selling veggie burrito or grilled cheese or fruit smoothy or glass pipe or art or handmade clothes or whatever the broad avenue of camper and pickup backed up for business is known affectionately a shakedown street in homage to the dead who came before u whatever you seek will be found at this carnival like bazaar especially if it’s a consciousness altering substance or if it make you laugh 3 the nitrous mafia for five buck you can buy a big round balloon filled with nitrous oxide the businessmen who own the tank one hears have earned a scurrilous reputation in some quarter i have not investigated further other than to perform quality control on their product which i can report doe indeed make one laugh and feel slightly faint and euphoric for a very brief time maybe a minute this is why you often see folk at a phish concert walking around the parking lot with three or more balloon in hand 4 fabulous forum old school a floor and two mezzanine no corporate skybox no separation between the swaying body no obstructed or partial view a fabulous place to see a rock concert 5 a seasoned quartet jon mike page and trey have been jamming together for something like 35 year the depth of their groove go beyond tight it’s a kind of telepathy aficionado consider them phish 3 0 twice before they broke up went on hiatus this version i’m told is slightly le rapid fire virtuosity and more transcendent grooviness they play appropriately loud but not punishingly loud by the rumble in your chest you know you’re at a rock concert but you don’t need earplug and you can actually talk with the person next to you without shouting phish music is pleasure music pain isn’t part of it the band seems happiest when every single person in the arena is up on her foot dancing his as off singing along or not having a good time however you define that so long a no one is harmed is paramount 6 ck5 the band’s lighting designer chris kuroda is considered the fifth member of phish his contribution definitely enhance the sensual experience his light don’t just change color and move about on mobile rig they dance and at the perfect moment and it’s always coming his light fall on the audience illuminating reveler in various stage of ecstasy 7 e l and maryjane phish is a great band their light show is magnificent the crowd they draw is kind and goodhearted but surely some measure of the amazingness must be attributed to the splendid effect of mind and mood altering drug like mdma mushroom and lsd in addition to dancing for about three hour straight i spent most of the concert laughing out loud with tear streaming down my face overwhelmed by the wonderful marvelous beautiful absurdity of life of being human for one night i wa in on the cosmic joke and when you need an attitude refresher cannabis is omnipresent joint and pipe and vape pen get handed around like a collection plate on sunday nothing’s surreptitious and no amount of indoor blazing seems to bother the relevant authority so yes a happy happy happy trippy trippy trippy crowd what would happen if we replaced flouride in our municipal water with trace amount of lsd nothing bad so far a i can tell 8 encore some experience you’re glad to have had but you wouldn’t choose to repeat some you want to repeat every day i’m not joining the vagabond yet not traveling around the country for camping raving and dreaming but the next time phish is in town you’ll find me there effortlessly blending in with my tribe of beautiful weirdo

an era in the band lineage referred to a 2 0 this era ha had it quality of play highly debated and in a fit of stimulant fueled sleeplessness i decided to write a brief review on every single show more or le commenting on the highlight of each night enjoy 12 31 02 first show post hiatus the type of show that if you weren t physically there then it nothing special wave seven below and wall of the cave debut all being played fairly well 1 02 03 chalkdust gin opener similar to 8 09 04 but not a long improvisational back on the train is a good listen energetic and moderately fluid simple my friend my friend is not super well played but i love the combination of those two song 46 day debut is awesome clocking in around 20 minute setting it place in the phish rotation immediately 1 03 03 pebble and marble debut nice peak and clean play all of these dream also debuted not much to talk about there aside from a well played wolfman s this show is largely banter instrument switching during rhe second set closer possum so you know it s not going to be gorgeous but still some good on stage antic 1 04 03 anything but me and friday debut aside from that great song selection but nothing spectacular just a well played roggae and weekapaug a well a a nice maze 2 14 03 fee taste bathtub gin wotc carini good playing and decent transition fun listen late second set ac dc bag caspian is a nice way to send you off 2 15 03 good moment in both set particularly the ghost and the hood ghost is an atypical for the era euphoric groove with nice work from page and hood is mostly type i predictable jamming until the band break into an extended angry outro jam 2 16 03 piper dwd reprise funkalicious very captivating moderately sad video on youtube very very good listen with high dancing capability and a full band disease jam one of my favorite from 2 0 possibly my favorite piper if i m being honest david bowie catapult david bowie and disease seven below disease are also worth listening to 2 18 03 2 0 momas are always a treat some decent above average playing at time and a debut of a capella the lion sleep tonight see 04 30 94 for good instrumental version most notably the david bowie found on faux the archive volume 3 2 20 03 wave simple jibboo tweezer baby brother to the 2 28 03 tweezer second set is exceptional nothing that captivating 2 21 03 fairly average but satisfying dark mike s jam segue into a decent free lifeboy break out last played 11 25 98 2 22 03 not amazing but definitely one of the better show in 2003 piper is really nice with some blissful keyboard work mildly intense and quick build up leading into the segue into weekapaug the first of this song without mike s song which is especially fluid both are very type i version with nothing that stand out other than good musicianship nicely played tube that go into near noteworthy territory in term of length 11 30 min by today s standard with clean full band interplay gin follows and is played well a well with a couple neat tease clock in at 26 minute and change making it one of the longer one ever performed perhaps only surpassed by the winston salem 97 beautiful rendition with a very euphoric hose jam until they change their tone and start going into a darker more daunting jam that play on the gin theme which almost sound like a digital delay loop jam set ii set i in my opinion isnt that generally the case though 2 24 03 nothing particularly great b b king played with the band for everyday i have the blue through rock me baby not fantastic but not deplorable 2 25 03 just solid playing worth a listen if you find yourself craving 2 0 but something aside from the standouts first set is fairly well played with some good energy and the second set is nice song selection but nothing special talk wa played for the first time since 8 06 98 2 26 03 beautiful and energetic yem serene roggae über funky moma above average stash despite it being rather straightforward nice and a ghost filled with improvisation including a segue into low rider honestly one of the better show of this era a great listen start to finish with plenty of stand out moment lot of fun debut in the first set of some short song previously performed by various side project of the band 2 28 03 one of the if not the best 2 0 show destiny unbound bustout phenomenal hose type gin that s exceedingly euphoric followed by a calm sleep to bring u back down to earth right before the super high energy and quite possibly best or at least my favorite back on the train tweezer is one of the best ever in my opinion extremely cathartic with some really great work from fishman nears the 30 minute mark and not a single second is wasted the young folk might refer to this jam a epic a weird bowie pretty hard to listen to but unique i suppose follows after the first soul shakedown party since amsterdam 97 which is proceeded by round room before a nice tension filled climactic hood to close the set destiny unbound wa played for the first time since 11 15 91 this show is in contention for one of the best show ever played in my opinion 3 01 03 a fairly great show to end winter tour 03 fun song selection a per my taste a nicely done foam mark the best part of the first set the second set doe not disappoint with a high octane piper that hint at oye como va at time and is just generally excited in nature coming to a conclusion at around 17 minute yem proud mary is absolutely worth listening to very nice playing all around followed by some fun full band a cappella on a song that hadn t been played since the very first time phish performed together 7 07 03 not much to mention aside from the spacious yet groovy wolfman s brother that segue into the debut of scent and subtle sound which ha a fairly intense jam section more or le the only part of the show worth a visit 7 08 03 two type ii jam in this one down with disease to open set ii then after two stop at vulture and the debut of secret smile we get the first type ii harry hood of summer tour 2003 7 09 03 yem simple to start the show i think this might be the only time they ve ever between the two chalkdust is pretty cool with an interesting ending that is based off of the rave up in the mango song a type ii gin end the first set with multiple section and some abstract space dissonance transporting the listener into another planet piper twist scent is the bulk of set ii including the first big piper of summer tour 2003 honestly i think 2 0 wa the prime era for piper between the 2 16 03 version and the 7 31 03 version i truly believe there wa something in the worm s water a very groove oriented jam that climax before falling into a calm ending twist is pretty standard but still a solid version with a good segue into scent good show to listen to start to finish but not that phenomenal 7 10 03 pretty good moma in the first set that s repetitive at time but nonetheless funky with some good energy behind it interesting divided sky with a jam akin to dave s energy guide rest of the show isn t great honestly 7 12 03 a very driven taste start of the show which carry some momentum however not much else follows interesting song choice which some might have a distaste for maze is always a nice ending to the first set and this time around the band get real nasty with it lot of angry and dark vibe coming from this set i closer set ii isn t anything special either for the most part until a nice and heavy hitting ghost come out to play with some beautiful varied jamming with izabella esque moment after they hit the peak of the show in that late second set performance a bowie follows to close set ii and prepare u for an energetic frankenstein tweeprise encore average show with some real nugget of greatness 7 13 03 seven below featured on the 7 29 03 livephish release a filler strange but cohesive with a cool darker toned metal jam that come out later on in this improvisation fueled rendition rest of the show isn t anything special but this seven below is 7 15 03 ac dc bag ya mar mike s groove mr completely with an abundance of segue and transition for this debut including bbfcfm low rider and ha ha ha wall of the cave aggressive type i wotc work great beginning to the show in bag ya mar setting up the night to be filled with energy ya mar especially ha fantastic interplay between trey and page mike s is very standard but nonetheless played well with the grit that you should expect from 2 0 and lead nicely into hydrogen and ultimately a rocking groovy weekapaug to end set i the debut of mr completely consumes the majority of set ii with some incredible funk jamming proving early on that this new song mean business they begin to jam on low rider for a bit and then jovial madness ensues when they segue into big black furry creature from mar followed by an uptempo buried alive continuing with the mayhem they play bbfcfm again with a brief stop at ha ha ha and then bbfcfm once more before returning to what you could consider mr completely to end a nearly half set long series of segue and jam wall of the cave is played shortly after and it stay pretty type i with some san ho zay tease and high tempo shredding definitely one of the better show from this era and a show that s worth a listen from start to finish 7 17 03 a decent first set with a good performance of back on the train followed by a into divided sky a a highlight a fun set i closing sequence that includes dancing and transcendence in a span of 25 minute a fairly good second set start with a spacey tweezer that segue into a moderately jammed out makisupa policeman followed by a well played limb by limb some more or le standard rendition of some song common to the era and some song that are staple in the phish rotation follow before ending set ii with a nice antelope that ha a major mode jam in the midst of the traditional buildup to the rye rye rocco segment 7 18 03 the first set is really only marked by very exceptional version of roggae that is a bit more rocking than usual however the bathtub gin mango song is definitely interesting a improv filled disease that segue into catapult start u off in the second set with mediocrity to follow until a very spacey effect laden twist take over for a bit which is quite enjoyable and then lead into a le than spectacular character zero to end the set a 16 minute type ii hood is provided for the encore which is very similar to other version of the song played this tour albeit significantly shorter and cap off the show very nicely 7 19 03 while there s nothing special about the first set the second set could stand alone an extended exploratory piper start u off spreading itself out and filling any and all empty hole in the sound surrounding the listener some great spacey yet driven and energy filled jamming with no particular destination until they decide to move forward and play rock and roll almost immediately after ending the jam a well played type i rock and roll proceeds and add some more liveliness to the set before segueing beautifully near flawlessly into an equally type i seven below which stay withing the boundary of a conventional 7 until it segue yet again into a prince caspian that is a bit more gritty perhaps even angry than usual a is customary with 2 0 a nice predictable peak ensues and then the band arrives upon yem a well played composed section is followed with an extended jam section that s reeeaaalll funky and very characteristic of the time period being very rough around the edge yet somehow clean and funky which lead to a vocal jam sans bass and drum segment 7 21 03 the first set includes a fairly straight forward yet well played stash and a nicely jammed out bird that ha an ominous glow behind it which lead into a calm transition into a pretty typical mike s groove aside from weekapaug which after some typical high energy type i jamming move into more percussive and exploratory space and concludes with an atypical rave up outro set ii doesn t have too much depth but doe include a nice rocking taste with a strong peak followed by an exceptionally improvisational 46 day your standard run of the mill summer tour 2003 performance 7 22 03 some atypical song selection placement is accented by two great performance of two great song an 18 minute gumbo in the first set flirt with dark and light theme and provides equal part contemplation and excitement very characteristic of 2 0 phish and an amazing version of this classic a 23 minute split open and melt is the prominent part of the second set although about half of this rendition is pretty typical maybe even lackluster the boy eventually navigate their way into a multi sectioned dark uptempo rocking jam that might fit in in the soundtrack of a horror film 7 23 03 although this show ha multiple great moment the most important part to me is the late set i sneakin sally i firmly believe that this is the best version of this cover which really only mean it s my favorite replete with gnarly funk this jam rage on for over 15 minute which at the time wa the longest version performed san francisco 2016 having recently dethroned it no vocal jam is included just straight up fiery sludgy dance inducing greatness i should probably mention the scent disease and antelope that go beyond standard format from this show but just give them a listen if you re interested they re pretty damn good too 7 25 03 a nice proper chalkdust early on in the first set set the tone for an exciting show one of several lengthy 2 0 bathtub gin fill the role of jam vehicle for the first set with multiple section that provoke emotion of both euphoria and anxiety after a fairly standard remainder to the first set and an equally non spectacular beginning to the second harry hood ha begun in the second to last slot of this portion of the show a sloppy composed section lead into a monstrous type ii jam that is pretty atypical for hood with an extremely exploratory section with great depth in the place where the band usually build to a peak after around 12 to 15 minute and brings the whole song near the 30 minute mark before reaching the proper hood peak type ii beauty filled with dark tension and overall great interplay between the band a an added surprise set ii close with a very nice bowie that includes a full band tweezer tease in the midst of the jam another 2 0 show with a lot of musical merit worthy of praise 7 26 03 an it s ice that could easily be found in an early 90 s setlist is featured early on in the first set lot of improvisation a one would expect and a very well played version overall average playing follows up to taste to close set i with some really beautiful peaking and an extended solo from trey who brings the volume down real low before bringing it all the way up for a fiery close one of the acclaimed summer 03 piper lead off set ii and is practically the only part of the set that is worth talking about over 20 minute long multiple section and heavily improvisational a you should expect from these piper just incredible fluid full band play that includes a can t you hear me knockin tease the show a a whole ha good song selection in my opinion with a nice balance between jamming and your standard rock and funk that phish base many of their song upon 7 27 03 a near 20 minute ghost and an over 10 minute caspian are the highlight of this show nothing that far out there with ghost being your standard summer 2003 exploratory version culminating in a rocking peak and caspian barely make it way beyond caspian proper but definitely being with inspiration good song selection regardless 7 29 03 spotify release the first set ha a very nice jibboo which is played very well and peak very nicely albeit predictably but lasting a bit longer than most version definitely a good energy to it scent of a mule is always a treat being played 5 time in two year post hiatus a well played composed section with a digital delay loop jam prior to the klezmer which briefly lead into an angry heavy metal type jam before concluding in standard fashion includes a wouldn t it be lovely jam from trey fish and mike during the mule duel fee lead up to a maze tease in the outro with synth work from page before segueing into a rage filled timber that nearly go beyond conventional format before concluding two song later the band play the only performance of mcgrupp and the watchful hosemasters during this era and a great one it is with page leading and full band participation during the jam before coming to an end set ii open with crosseyed and painless which develops into a behemoth of a jam over 20 minute of percussive rocking energetic heat capable of melting steel beam a great version that s the trademark of one of the most notable show of 2003 7 30 03 a phenomenal first set scent and subtle sound set the tone early on that this show is going to be great with 30 minute of rock funk space grunge sludge and grit driven by an amazing performance by fishman perhaps the best performance of scent to date chalkdust is brief but worth noting a it s played pretty well and ha an even darker theme to it than your typical ominous chalkdust second set is nothing to sleep on either twist is very 2000 esque being somewhat ambient with a 2003 edge to it and a good amount of exploration that almost peak before shifting towards a dark sentiment bug which is always welcome for me follows and this one is played well but frankly there s nothing special about it one of my favorite yems if not my favorite proceeds it transition between composed section are so clean that you hardly notice them and the playing inside each part is very crisp the jam segment is very high octane being equal part funky and rocking wotc is your standard well played 2 0 version worth a listen nonetheless ending a great four song second set of a great show 7 31 03 pretty good show overall nice moma with some cool sound provided by mike s meatball effect followed by an average yet enjoyable divided sky providing a nice transcendent energy to contrast with moma s funk the final big summer 2003 piper kick off set ii beautiful yet a bit more eerie than the two preceding it and a bit unsettling at time with the expected full throttle race to the finish mike s song come next with nothing really worth noting and after wrapping up and transitioning into hydrogen we arrive upon weekapaug and it s predictably a funky and bouncy a the other version performed this year with an in a gadda da vida tease following an extended funky outro another type ii hood close out the set and while still dark and exploratory this performance is a bit more melodic than it 7 25 03 counterpart and end about 7 minute earlier good song selection in this show excluding a late second set friday prior to hood 11 28 03 first crime of the mind since 1994 well played wave with an extended intro and a jam on the scarier jarring side disease move a bit past type i but nothing that far out there not all that spectacular 11 29 03 pretty below average lot of san ho zay tease banter in the middle of the second set twist is the only real noteworthy moment with a major mode jam that make it way into the realm of dissonance before reconvening on a more groove oriented theme and then getting dissonant again with some added anger before segueing into simple good song selection however the majority of them are played with a degree of mediocrity 12 01 03 cool show somewhat of a nostalgia act with jeff holdsworth coming on stage for camel walk through fire and that being the first time he played with the band since he left in 1986 wolfman s is played nicely with a euphoric type i on steroid jam tweezer open the second set with trey particularly absent from the jam enjoyable and fun but not too hard on the mind 12 02 03 20th anniversary of the first ever phish performance some fairly inspired playing with a nice driven piper in the middle of set i rock and roll open set ii with a nice bluesy groovy jam that segue into weekapaug which wa played without mike s song preceding it however trey sang the lyric to mike s song over the tweezer reprise that followed late second set boogie on reggae woman is played with some gusto and is followed up with a very brief city maze follows with an unusual style following page s section and continues into trey s part lot of segue in the second set which is always pleasurable but not quite a high quality a others good song selection in my opinion 12 28 03 pretty solid playing throughout tweezer ha a nice trey solo in the middle of a fairly standard jam that gradually brings the song to a peak a very well played frankie say come along a few song after with some beauty a well a darkness followed up with llama with a bit of an usual trey section accompanied by some good playing by page a strong happy jibboo open the second set with a very strong peak with some great synchronization among the band member the suzy that follows is almost violent in nature and includes a second jam similar to the darien 2000 suzy with this one being more angry and heavy metal based a nice theme from the bottom follows which is played a bit calmer than usual a standard hood end off set ii with a nice pristine peak definitely a show that ha more value start to finish a opposed to it highlight 12 29 03 first set ha it moment piper opener is strong but conventional with a return to the refrain at the ending limb by limb ha multiple peak and some great energy second set start off with five segue rock and roll twist boogie on reggae woman ghost free but none of them are particularly fortuitous worth a listen though followed by a strong divided sky with some powerful moment of silence prior to a beautiful conclusion 12 30 03 super funky 2001 with parliament funkadelic bathub gin sand and auld lang syne tease initiating a dance party to end set i tube la woman bird la woman is fun fairly well played but in my opinion tube would ve been better off standing alone extended jamming with a very nice funk groove characteristic of tube p funk medley is so bad that it s funny and i love it for that reason george clinton sings lil jon all i can say a calmer melodic disease end the set 12 31 03 wilson wa finished from the night prior to open the first set mike s groove climax with a rocking weekapaug jam that grows dissonant at time with jungle boogie tease followed by an energetic return to weekapaug with divided sky tease tube is finished from the night before stash turned into a jam with multiple section including a lot of effect some more rhythmic section and some good old upbeat major mode jamming runaway jim is jammed out with a lot of intensity and improvisation making for a great unique version overall new year 2003 wa a decent run with some great moment sprinkled throughout but no real consistency 3 13 04 the boy play the national anthem at a uvm basketball game go bengils that s college level vega 04 sad although i did enjoy listening to trey sing the lyric to meatstick over tweezer reprise 6 17 04 live in brooklyn available on spotify is a pretty good show across the board asihtos ha a nice jam that s fairly dark at time and definitely rocking later on in the first set there s a great version of moma dance with some awesome abrasive funk rock to start leading into the verse followed by a dark death march esque outro jam that segue into free 46 day possum is an excellent way to start of the second set with a great pulsing jam out of 46 day leading into an excellent segue the suzy that follows is very jammed out and improvisational seemingly played with a lot of drive and purpose the remainder of the second set isn t half bad at all but nothing out of the ordinary 6 18 04 jay z special guest 99 problem big pimpin monumental time in phishtory 6 19 04 great show up there with some of the great song selection is key here first set doesn t have any serious stand but rather operates a a beautiful unit mid second set piper tweezer reprise jam piper gotta jibboo is the highlight incredible lengthy jam with a great segue from song to song absolutely a must hear perhaps the trademark 2004 jam some argue that this is one of the best piper of all time 6 20 04 i believe that this show is in contention for one of the best show ever wave is the centerpiece of the first set with a nice rhythmic jam included some maze tease aside from that the first set ha some great song and some well played short jam capped up with one of the best performance drowned with an amazing celebratory uptempo shred fest with trey landing on a really enjoyable theme towards the end second set function best a a whole a opposed to having stand out moment dark yet celebratory and energizing a great set to end a great run at spac 6 23 04 nothing spectacular but i really enjoy the song selection in this show a calm and groovy gin a well a a tension filled scent with some no2 tease are highlight of an otherwise decent show good combination of fun catharsis space and improvisation 6 24 04 really cool first set unusual placement with the loving cup opener a nice city back on the train follows which is combination i d love to see more of dwd rock and roll is not spectacular but still enjoyable personally i m not huge on this second set but tube and timber are great i really enjoy the way those two song are played in 2003 2004 6 25 04 first set highlight is a wolfman s that s nastier than watkins glen water supply awesome funky groove that stay within the bound of wolfman s proper with a signature 2 0 abrasiveness good seven below to open set ii albeit pretty tame love buffalo bill and lawn boy in this slot another good 2 0 weekapaug also with inspired celebratory shredding making for a very fun to listen to second set interesting yem 2001 yem 6 26 04 sick moog work from mike in this boogie very dancey and bouncy free and ghost are played exceptionally well with ghost being a bit more upbeat than usual for 2004 friday separate this sequence from a snappy and rocking piper that provides the set with a bit more energy before closing with a relatively standard version of hood 8 9 04 mostly a pretty poor show with trey suffering technical problem however the chalkdust and the gin to open the first set are great and could easily find themselves at home a a second set opening combination chalkdust is around 20 minute long with some melodic jamming that go beyond your conventional chalkdust lot of emphasis on page in this one and the jam is very driven emotive and powerful one of the better chalkdust jam out there bathtub gin come in right after to keep the momentum going with some intense 2 0 typical jamming that peak really beautifully sadly the momentum fade and the rest of the show is rather mediocre 8 10 04 the first set start and end with some phenomenal jamming in ac dc bag and bird both jam are extended and inspired culminating in very celebratory peak yet another good 2 0 weekapaug is played during the second set with an unusual slowed down ending rest of the show is between average and le than average 8 11 04 a page driven suzy in the second song slot add some fuel to the first set with a superb jam segueing into a dark exploratory disease fishman is particularly strong throughout this jam antelope open the second set and instead of peaking like normal make it way into a more melodic groove oriented jam with the ending verse being excluded later on in the second set the band pack some serious energy into a 10 minute wave a beautiful intro leading into the verse followed by a very inspired jam straight to the point and delivers it message effectively with euphoric excellence 8 12 04 yem ghost maze catapult maze is enjoyable good transition segue but lacking any spectacular jamming second set start off very mellow and low key with a nice and calm piper opener followed by a sneakin sally that s equally a tranquil after taking several step along the way scent close out the second set with a typical improvisational jam combining theme of rhythm groove dissonance and ambience festival note it dwd ghost chalkdust 46 day wave ya mar reba really the whole weekend is worth listening to a great performance overall fantastic improvisation that extends for longer period of time similar to jam of the early 90 40 minute 46 day very dark wave and ghost extended ya mar jam runaway jim and possibly the best reba for the era chalkdust jam for over 20 minute night one is very segue heavy especially the third set with every jam seemingly hitting full potential with a nice balance between high energy rocking and deep dark exploration night two ha a similar balance however the extremely ominous jam in ghost and 46 day are hard to match up against the tower jam on night one is worth mentioning however your time is better spent listening to the in set performance seriously these show are worth listening to start to finish on all account a definitive conclusion to an excellent summer tour the soundcheck is widely regarded a one of the best ever although i think bethel wave or clifford ball take the cake coventry 8 14 04 8 15 04 wotc runaway jim gotta jibboo ac dc bag 46 day soamelt drowned ghost wading in the velvet sea if you re in the mood to cry both night are worth listening to in their entirety if you can tolerate sloppy composed section that are tainted with sadness seriously some great cathartic tension and emotion filled jamming ac dc bag is divine jamming for over 20 minute with a great rocking energy leading up to a clean segue into a brief 46 day split open and melt is one of the longest version of this song coming in at just over 31 minute trey delivers an emotional speech before beginning and this clearly affect his performance a the composed section is atrocious however the jam is phenomenal with ton of improvisation and grooving with understandably melancholy undertone before becoming a bit more optimistic for a few minute setting up a segue into ghost and bringing the set to an angry dissonant close overall the soundcheck might be the easiest part of this festival to listen to but there are moment of really great inspired jamming to conclude i d like to list which jam i consider must hear quality 2 16 03 piper 2 28 03 bathtub gin tweezer 7 22 03 gumbo split open and melt 7 23 03 sneakin sally thru the alley 7 25 03 harry hood 7 30 03 scent yem 8 2 03 ya mar disease 8 3 03 chalkdust ghost 46 day 6 19 04 piper 6 20 04 drowned 8 14 04 ac dc bag 8 15 04 soamelt

1,what song haven’t been played this decade from zzyzx on facebook today thought everyone would enjoy after a few year playing the break the record number of song played game followed by the no repeat for 13 show baker dozen i had a momentary curiosity a to what is left what hasn t been played this decade that is the problem with bustouts like so many thing they re a non renewable resource every time one come out after a long gap people get excited but then that one is burned 1 i decided to see what hadn t been played this decade 8 year in after coming up with the right thing to put into the phish stats pattern matcher 2 i went to the most common song not seen cranked it up to 50 and looked the most common song phish have not played in this decade take the a train that fit a pattern these song can be largely slightly under half lumped into a few group fishman song jazz number that might not scale to larger venue song that got swallowed by another or changed e g standalone fluff s travel segment and a capella song of the one that are left a lot still aren t high up on most people s list is there clamor for acoustic army or dave s energy guide if you re looking for a real bustout i think these are your best possibility all thing reconsidered pro are that it s really high up in the number of time played hadn t been played in 21 year and it s featured on one of the more popular studio album the con of course is that it s not a very forgiving song to perform on a whim johnny b goode when phish were in the mood they blazed through this in the 90 and it s the kind of song that can be played reasonably well if someone randomly call for it mid set it is a cover though and a pretty common one so that might damper the excitement a bit eliza beautiful short and hasn t been played since 1992 this would be my first call for a bustout if they wanted one i don t know how hard this is to play but i would love to see it again talk it only barely hasn t been played outside this decade last appeared on the 11 1 09 acoustic set but it feel more like a common phish song than it 14 actual performance however if i could choose one song out of the top 50 most common not played in the teen to return it would be a cover it would be a fishman tune but it would be my personal favorite not played since 6 10 94 played 9 time in phish s history i d love to see the return of i wan na be like you the remaining picking are weird but that s one i ve wanted back since the time i saw it 1 mind you if a song is only played once a year while you don t get that whole thrill that the song hadn t been played since 1993 there still will be thousand of people seeing it for the first time by luck of the draw 2 1 is the string if you re curious

1,25th anniversary of my first show i wa only 15 year old on august 7 1993 when i saw my first phish show i couldn t legally drive yet which made going to show difficult compound that with the fact that i lived in a small town and i really hadn t had much experience with live music at all my first concert of any kind wa the grateful dead at rich stadium on june 13 1993 phish had played near my town on february 10 1993 and i knew people who were going to that show at that point though i didn t really know anything about concert i m not sure i even knew where to go about getting ticket i wasn t invited to go along with the older people going to that show anyway and finding a way there myself would have been very difficult so my first time seeing phish would have to be delayed until august i don t remember if i d heard any live phish tape before that show i certainly wasn t familiar with all the song they played the picture of nectar cd wa definitely familiar to me because that wa my first exposure of any kind to phish unfortunately because i wa so new to the band a lot of great stuff from the show wa lost on me i didn t know what the hell wa going on during kung for example nevertheless i enjoyed the show immensely and wa definitely hooked listening to the show now i hear a somewhat different band than the one i saw at the gorge this summer the phish of august 1993 is gone forever which is somewhat sad on the whole though it s not only inevitable but necessary i don t think any of u would truly want to band to just stay the same a it wa in any particular period of their music though i would definitely like to hear another 1994 level performance now and again my relationship with the music ha had it ups and down i wa checked out for pretty much all of 2 0 and before the gorge show this summer the last time i d seen phish live wa in 2012 they have to keep changing though because they always have pick any two year in the band s history and you re likely to hear big difference there is a noticeable difference between 1993 and 1994 1994 and 1997 1992 and 2000 etc with that continuous evolution come the possibility of the band entering territory that i or you do not like a much i just have to accept that because it s certainly happened before let s be honest they ve written some downright bad song in recent year and will happen again a long a they keep playing the only thing that will keep them playing though is being able to evolve and change i don t think any of the band member want to be up on stage trying to recreate the sound of 1993 or any particular year forever and let s be honest we don t either 1993 phish is dead long live 1993 phish i ve gone a bit off track here but suffice it to say that if you haven t heard 8 7 93 before you owe it to yourself to give it a listen live phish link phish in link

1,iso the gorge 2018 divided sky video after seeing 20 phish show since i got into the band in 3 0 and having been at several awesome show including the dozen last year and alpharetta last weekend that divided sky at the gorge wa just the peak for me having never been out there before and the amazing sunset a the song wa playing and trey’s purer than pure tone it just really hit home for me doe anyone have a good video they can share i can’t seem to find anything after searching i would love to see the webcast footage if possible but if that’s not possible i would love to see someone’s long video help thanks in advance
1,how doe the band pack for tour just a random thought my driver started pondering the other day how exactly do they prep for tour like non musically do they have assistant who pack for them do they pack themselves i m sure they pack at least a few thing for themselves they are still just people obviously but seriously i don t know why but i m suddenly so curious about this do their bus have wardrobe that are always packed and ready i m sure this is the more plausible answer but even if that s the case do they own the bus or are they rented if they re rented they can t leave stuff on them and especially when they start a tour on the west coast they all live in the northeast so they have to fly out to the first venue who prep all their shit the crew take care of all the gear and stage equipment but who take care of fishman s dress page s shirt trey s 3 button pullover more importantly who take care of mike s clothes

1,buying dick camping pas at the gate i m told they never sell out of camping pass and then if i wait until i get to dick i should have no problem buying a camping pas at the gate how feasible likely is this getting the ticket before hand would obviously ease my mind and allow me to not stress but if i m able to save some money and wait i might do that is this plausible or should i just secure my ticket now and keep my mind at ease

1,venue profile mpp what’s new regarding the recent renovation with photo i wa there a couple week ago to feel the byrne and thought i’d post an update on what’s new at merriweather since a number of people have asked about it any other pointer correction clarification are welcome in the comment of course 1 parking the lot are now paved striped and numbered they have no tailgating no alcohol sign but we’ll see how serious they are byrne crowd wasn’t exactly partying so it wa hard to gauge if you don’t have a pas which is free a welcome relief if you were at camden try a distant space at the mall or hickory ridge rd i’ve parked up in the neighborhood there before with no problem 2 security used to be pretty cool now they have a no backpack rule size limit on other bag 15 x 15 i think bag search and metal detecting wand all relatively casual a far a that kind of thing go more like nashville than the gorge 3 merch the merch booth is now only over on mike side i think so if you want a poster line up at the west box office entrance the booth is right inside that entrance poster tube were 5 each at byrne not sure if that’s the norm now or if it varies with the band 4 the roof the roof ha been raised way up from where it used to be with these added and a yet unfinished elevated deck on the side likely not open til next season possibly ada related a they’re served by elevator shaft there are also separate stair down to the pit in addition to the old walkway through the pav seating the view ha really opened up should be great from the lawn and it’s a little brighter inside the pav there are also two screen flanking the stage now and just one central screen on the roof facing the lawn 5 the lawn the lawn now ha a paved walkway running across the middle from mike side to page side 6 drinkin’ cut off is about 10 30 seems to be the norm now 7 smokin’ they’re trying the no smoking’ thing again but it’s likely nothing to worry about same a most pavs these day i did see some vapers but didn’t bring mine so i can’t say how that shake out with security 8 what hasn’t changed if you haven’t been there since 2015 the new bathroom and concession closest to the pav may be new to you i forget when all that wa added but otherwise the surroundings are the same shade tree are still there picnic table are fewer but still there and the surrounding development isn’t really noticeable from inside it’s still tree and sky which is nice 9 photo album that about cover it from what i’ve seen too bad we have to burn it all down now but that’s how it go

1,the 5th annual r phish summer tour contest 2018 edition submission form response standing will be posted once tour the contest start donation see below on what this is curveball n2 submission form curveball n2 response lady and gentlmen we’ve hit 5 year of the annual r phish summer tour contest apparently in marriage the gift you should give your significant other is wood or silverware to be more modern what is this contest i’m glad you asked simply put you the user of reddit and subscriber of r phish will guess what song phish will play each night of their summer tour from stateline nv to commerce city co how do i enter in the google questionnaire linked above submit your guess on what you think phish will be playing select the date enter your song and submit what are these category the standard category to guess are set 1 opener set 1 closer set 1 wildcard set 2 opener set 2 closer set 2 wildcard and encore there is also two bonus category bustout and cover song there will be a separate form for curveball n2 what doe wildcard mean a wildcard guess is any song that they play in the set are there determined point value we can earn from each category yes opener closer and encore will be worth 5 point wildcards are worth 3 cover song are also worth 3 point and guess that are submitted a no covers’ which mean phish will play all of their own original will net 1 point if guessed correctly if phish play all original bustouts which are must harder to guess are worth an outstanding 10 point this year if you don’t believe phish will bust anything out for the night enter no bustouts ’ and they do just that then you will earn 1 point last year i didn’t like the partial point system how will it be updated this year i did take in the feedback and made sure to put in what you all suggested into practice if you select a song let’s say sample in a jar a the set 1 opener but it’s played a either the set 1 wildcard or set 1 closer then you earn 2 point if it’s played in a different set anytime during set 2 the encore or set 3 during curveball then you earn 1 point what do you consider a bustout a bustout is a song that hasn t been played in 50 show minimum what constitutes a a cover a cover is a song that is considered a tab mike vida blue pork tornado song god forbid they play pork tornado or obviously by another artist bowie talking head etc i consider everything on an album an original manteca bug plus some song that haven t really found a home on an album halley s comet how many people are you please ask for certain clarification on what you think is considered a cover if enough people disagree then i’ll put up a poll to decide i want to make my bustout call also be a guess in the standard category can i do that your bustout call can be the same a the opener closer encore or wildcard an example is that you say your bustout call is all thing reconsidered you can also say that all thing reconsidered can be a set 2 wildcard however if you pick a song like sing monica a your set 2 wildcard then pick all thing reconsidered a your bust out call and only sing monica get played then you get just the appropriate point amount for that guess from that category to look at song with a 50 show gap you can look here i’m feeling lucky and want to put my bustout and cover a the same guess if you wish to put the same guess for a cover and bustout you can cover and bustouts are rare if you re crazy enough to call those category together you may go ahead phish is totally going to pay respect for insert artist here that passed away last week can a debut be called a a bustout debut can count a a bustout can’t i just comment my guess in here instead of using google google scare me sorry you must post in the google form for your call to count if your call is posted in this thread rather than google form i m not responsible for tracking it the second day of curveball will have 3 set and possibly a secret set what are you going to do

1,should i go to curveball ok so a little about me i m a new very casual fan i ve been to three show all during the dozen and loved all of them but i don t really feel the urge to listen to phish all that much outside of a live show setting i have exactly zero friend who are phans so this would definitely be a solo mission obviously since i ve seen phish before this isn t exactly new and i usually don t mind it at all but a three day festival is more than i ve ever even considered doing on my own i genuinely just love live music and probably go to 50 75 show a year that being said i m kinda all over the place and not super into the jam scene although there are definitely some other jam band out there that i am into my only real issue with the scene is that even mentioning some of them could get this conversation very off track and probably get some of u a little too heated logistically it only a 4 5 hour drive and the money shouldn t be an issue not like i couldn t think of something else like another show or festival to spend it on time off of work isn t an issue and i have no other plan that weekend so what doe everyone think am i crazy to even think twice i m open to hearing any comment tip ya ll have to offer thanks

completely not subjective methodology i listened to each album all the way through in a single sitting and then rated the album on a scale of 1 5 in three separate category cohesiveness accessibility and originality the most cohesive album rift wa the one where the song all seemed to fit together most naturally the least cohesive album junta lawn boy and a picture of nectar were more like sushi pizza they combine thing i like but that had no earthly business being combined accessibility measured how likely someone who wasn t already a phish fan or on a variety of substance wa to be able to get into the album i don t know about you but if you re telling me i need to snort some horse tranqs to unlock the transcendental musing of an album i will definitely snort some horse tranqs but i m not giving it a high accessibility score originality took into consideration how unique the songwriting wa relative to other band a well a to phish s own existing catalogue but much like sushi pizza originality on it own doesn t always equal good now if you mix sushi pizza with horse tranqs you might have something additionally i rated each song on each album on the y e m scale a in y yea this is great 1 point e ehh this isn t great but it s not bad either 0 point m meh this suck chode 1 point i thought this wa a good way to reward album that had great song and punish round room i m kidding but not really in any case an album s total point value wa the sum of their cohesiveness accessibility and originality score combined with their net y e m score i should also add my enjoyment of a song had nothing to do with how much or little i like to hear it live for example i d much rather get a tweezer at a show than a bouncing around the room but the former got an e and the latter got a y because studio album are by definition not show in fact sometimes i felt obligated to penalize an album if it wa trying too hard to capture phish s live sound at the expense of the aforementioned criterion finally you re entitled to disagree with my rating in fact a i wa going through it i kind of disagreed with some of it and if i did it over or started in a different order i went chronologically thing would probably be different but they re not because this is science and if you disagree with me your opinion is wrong but a long a you re polite you ll get an upvote from me

1,phish song of the day 9 brother a i ve stated in the previous psotd post these are basically copy pasta from the psotd email i send out please ignore any formatting error i do my best to make it look correct within reddit but sometimes this website just want to be difficult also i ll try to change the syntax to correctly reflect this a a forum post and not an email but there s no promise that i get everything if you re interested in receiving the email just pm me your email address or send me an email at i m more likely to keep up with the email than the daily post but so far i m posting them back to back so i m on a roll without furthur ado here s your phish song of the day 9 obviously you all just received the last psotd about 6 hour ago but technically it s a new day 2018 06 10 and i know for a fact at least one of you is in europe so it s basically monday already a i expressed to almost everyone involved these will come at you fairly sporadically at worst five day a week at best seven and in a perfect world we will go seven for seven and have the email be coherent for now we re falling somewhere in the middle i actually had a different song in mind for today other than the one i ultimately ended up choosing but it s father day so i picked brother and yes i m aware i missed out on a perfect opportunity to pick the 2011 06 19 harpua where they brought out their father i m saving harpua for later i actually don t have too much to say about brother it s not really a song i like very much and when i say that i mean in relation to other phish song obviously i like brother more than say there are some song that i feel would be better served without lyric and brother is one of them i dig the guitar riff and i really enjoy the way fishman hammer home the high hat gordon s bass line is thumping and page is hitting the organ hard it help create a real sense of anxiety a if somebody definitely is about to jump into the tub with your brother the definitive version of brother for me come in the form of where they not only play the full version but the radio friendly version a well starting on father day 2009 the band had all of their child jump into an onstage bath tub while playing brother solidifying the song a a father day tradition at least from 09 12 i ve included the show opening brother because it ha them introducing their child there s video of this performance that can be found in the history section of this email or on youtube the writing credit for brother are attributed to the whole band so who know which member is actually responsible for the phrase someone is definitely jumping in the tub with your brother cousin mother it appears to be split pretty evenly between the first and second set in term of when it s performed so much like your own sibling it s kind of a crap shoot on where it s going to end up statistic it wa played at 3 25 of live phish show it wa last played december 30 2017 which wa 1 show ago there have been 1 240 show since the live debut brother ha been played approximately once every 30 7 show since it debut brother ha been played on average once every 21 show since i sent these last two fairly close together i ve got probably a 30 hour psotd hiatus see you all on monday

1,psotd 10 twenty year later a i ve explained in the past two post these are just copy pasta from a mostly daily email i run if you want on that list email me at because at some point i liable to give up on writing the email and making a post because i have to fight with the format when i copy pasta it over anyway here s your dose before we really dive into this i d like it to be known that i m not the biggest 3 0 guy and a a result of that this daily email thread won t be filled with too many recent phish effort at least until i feel like i ve exhausted everything else i just tend to like my phish lyric a little more non linear and a they ve grown older and gained more perspective the song have become le abstract however i have chilled out on my militant dislike of almost all thing joy related i ve referred to it in the past a rehab phish but now having gone through my own rehab experience i can at least relate to it a little bit more i also happened to see a lot of phish in 2009 2010 and they really just drove the joy train home anyway with all that being said today we re doing twenty year the song is a marshall anastatio effort that make appearance almost exclusively in the second set lyrically the song rattle off a series of experience choice and idea that had led to them being where they are today your past experience help shape who you are a a person but just because you ve been through one thing doesn t mean something else isn t on the horizon there is always another challenge and always something that will you leaving feeling upside down just getting up each day and greeting it with positive energy and a will to be productive can be a challenge for some people at least i know it is for me and twenty year later put that into perspective that all being said i actually hope i see twenty year later this year our twenty year later come from in reading pa typically they play about an 8 9 minute straight forward version of the song in this case we have a 14 minute masterpiece sandwiched between taste and piper statistic it wa played at 1 65 of live phish show it wa last played july 29 2017 which wa 13 show ago there have been 353 show since the live debut twenty year later ha been played approximately once every 60 5 show since it debut twenty year later ha been played on average once every 11 8 show

1,psotd 13 carini alright i d assume you guy know the drill by this point i write these a an email if you want full commitment from me in relation to a daily phish song the email your best bet hit me up at to subscribe today s song ha pretty much all of my favorite element of phish song it ha nonsensical lyric that still kind of make sense in a meta way it ha oscillation it ha great type ii potential you can listen to how it evolved lyrically and musically over time and it ha a decent job and is willing to support me financially of course i m talking about the song debuted in 1997 in europe you can hear it on the amsterdam 97 box set with the original lyric we ll get to the lyric we ll get to the lyric change in a second the song itself is named after fishmans old drum tech pete carini carini himself wa fairly militant about the stage set up and really didn t like it when people would get overzealous and hop on stage in multiple show you can hear the band gleefully tell the crowd carini s gonna get you there are many element of the song itself that reference the man directly obviously and i m going to directly quote the history here because i just couldn t write it better myself according to report from taper on the europe tour the song wa actually inspired by an incident on that tour in which a college aged female fan wa enjoying an up front view of page before being told to move because she wa interfering with monitor man pete schall’s sight line her angry refusal apparently included a threat to call her influential parent resulting in the lyric he went across the street and he called his dad now you’ll never get that raise you thought you had one last carini altercation led to a change in the first line of the first verse of the song the original lyric were i saw you with carini and that piece of as you built your house with window but those window had no glass on 1998 11 06 a streaker jumped up on stage and wa tackled by carini the next show 1998 11 08 at the uic pavilion the lyric were irreversibly and forever changed to i saw with you carini and the naked dude i couldn t eat my food you can read about and watch the referenced altercation the writing credit are given to the whole band so it appears to have been a group effort when the lump first sprouted the doctor could locate it in the first set a the lump grew and thankfully didn t metastasize the song wa moved to the second set on rare occasion they have been using it a an opener 2016 10 31 2017 12 31 our lump is a 21 minute behemoth that opened the second set on 2017 07 16 northerly island chicago the reason i m picking it is because i wa listening to it so hard that i almost fell of my bicycle more on my bicycle later it s not like i had a of option to choose from though statistic it wa played at 5 18 of live phish show it wa last played december 31 2017 which wa 0 show ago there have been 680 show since the live debut carini ha been played approximately once every 19 3 show since it debut carini ha been played on average once every 7 2 show it wa played 94 time
1,give me your favourite hose moment from trey we actually have exercise that we do where we work on improving our improvising a a group it get rid of the ego it s an exercise to get rid of the ego and the more that we do it the more we find that our improvisation are le concerned with showing off flashy solo or whatever and more concerned with making a group sound there s a feeling that we always talk about when we went out with santana he had brought up this thing about the hose where the music is like water rushing through you and a a musician your function is really like that of a hose and and well his thing is that the audience is like a sea of flower you know and you re watering the audience but the concept of music going through you that you re not actually creating it that what you re doing is the best thing that you can do is get out of the way so when you are in a room full of people there s this kind of group vibe that seems to get rolling sometimes mike it get it really start to seem like it s not the audience or the band this thing that get rolling is it s own thing when thing are going really well and a jam ha taken off there s this feeling of motion that is created by the rhythm and at that point my bass that i m playing feel like this sortof vehicle or like a hitch for me to hold on to like someone would hold on to a um like if you were on a i wa thinking if you were on a ski lift maybe a chair lift or just something that would hook you on to the motion that s going and pull you along with it question are there slow hose jam do those count

1,9 year ago today i saw my first phish show for a little subtext i got into phish in around 2004 i had seen the dead for the first time that summer at the gorge with the allman brother band and to me it seemed like there were not many people at the show considering it wa the grateful god damn dead and i wa like where is everyone and people were like oh everyone s out on the east coast seeing phish play their last show and i m like who the fuck is phish and why would anyone go see them instead of the dead so when i got home i started listening to a couple phish show and yeah next thing i know it turn out phish is the band i d been searching for my whole life i tried so hard for hampton ticket but after realizing it wa never happening for me i focused on figuring out a way to make sure i got to see some peak phish and what better place to see some rarity and bust out than star lake so my first phish run wa star lake deer creek alpine x 2 in the summer of 09 it wa a feat coming from the canadian prairie ended up flying in and out of chicago and renting a car for the run we pretty much had nothing else planned no room booked or really anything figured out we just slept in the car two night and then got a room somewhere about 45 minute from alpine for the last two show anyway this wa the first show and the cool part is it wa all old school 1 0 phish stuff aside from alaska i m not going to say this wa peak phish i m one of those weirdo who doesn t actually think their first phish show wa like best show ever type stuff they weren t really jamming yet i think the first truly great phish show i saw wa probably at the gorge later that summer and honestly i think they ve continually gotten better since then some other highlight for me over the year have been vega 14 16 dick 11 15 mg 13 and really lockn 16 wa great too especially because i got to see ween open for phish hearing phish cover ween wa one of those thing that got me into phish in the first place so that wa great but looking back on it this wa a great show it didn t have that harpua or those really rare song that of course you re not going to get at your first show but that encore wa really awesome and yem wa definitely an epic thing to see live anyone else make it out to this one thursday set 1 golgi chalk dust bouncing around the wolfman s divided heavy walk david set 2 down with when the circus harry the squirming you enjoy encore hello my hold your head hold your head loving 1 unfinished 2 aborted this show featured the first walk away since october 5 2000 80 show disease wa unfinished after grind trey remarked that page blew the wrong note on the pitch pipe and had them all singing in the wrong key they decided to perform another a cappella song and trey joked that if they couldn’t get it right fish would sing bike sure enough hello my baby wa no better and wa aborted however true to his word trey announced that fish will now sing bike for his part fish took the opportunity to welcome everyone to the trainwreck portion of the show bike wa played for the first time since september 12 2000 95 show

1,the mount rushmore of phish jam i saw this and someone and in the comment someone had listed six must listen to jam someone else called it the mount rushmore of phish but a we all know mount rushmore only ha four president on it so that got me thinking about what would be the actual mount rushmore of phish jam and if you re gonna do a mount rushmore jam list i think you gotta match the song to the president here s my little stab at it g washington the murat surely the riverport or went gin are better than murat you re saying and you re probably right but george washington wasn t the greatest american president he wa the first president and much like washington paved the way for jefferson and lincoln the murat gin paved the way for it better known successor and other full band exploration t jefferson the albany jefferson wa our third president and i d argue our first truly great one the albany yem wasn t the first big phish jam but i d argue it wa the first truly transcendent one it went place no other yem had ever been to or gone to since a lincoln the denver lincoln wa arguably our greatest president so this wa by far the most challenging pick after several minute of deliberation i went with the denver ghost why it s 21 minute of perfection i can t find a flaw in it just like i can t find a flaw in lincoln s character maybe you could say the same thing about the went gin but i already gave it a shout out so i went with this also i like to imagine that after lincoln wa assassinated he came back in ghost form to melt the face of spun hippy just like this ghost t roosevelt the tahoe roosevelt is not only the most recent president included on mount rushmore but also the most controversial pick but whether you love him or think he s kinda over rated it s clear that the guy wa a total bad as much like the tahoe tweezer

1,phish in camden a history like just about all phish fan i am eagerly waiting to see what this summer ha in store for u in particular i’m anticipating the band’s arrival in camden nj for a two night stand in early august the only show i’ll be seeing this year out of equal part curiosity and boredom i thought it might be fun to take a look back at phish’s storied history at this particular venue what follows is a brief and subjective commentary on each of the the show played in camden to date please feel free to chime in with your thought memory and correction first a little background the venue in camden capacity 25 5k with 7k in the shed ha gone by various name over the year it began it life a the e centre in the 1 0 era and then hosted phish 2 0 a the tweeter center by the time the band reunited in 2009 they were playing the susquehanna bank center a of 2015 the venue ha been called the pavilion one side of the concert ground face the delaware river waterfront and boast panoramic view of my hometown of philadelphia on the other side is well camden new jersey the surrounding area is hardly scenic and pre show activity are confined primarily to sprawling parking lot the venue itself can charitably be described a a typical northeast shed with little to recommend it except for the aforementioned view of the city across the river the lawn is forgiving with multiple good sight line in my experience the sound ha always been adequate while the concert venue may receive mixed review there is little doubt about the generally high quality of the music that phish ha played there to date phish ha played 10 concert in camden nj those show have produced no le than 33 song version that appear on the jam chart of those 33 17 are recognized a especially improvisational or otherwise notable 10 song played at camden have clocked in at 20 minute looking a bit deeper into the stats we find that 6 song have debuted in camden 4 of which were one timer more interesting to me are the often played song that have never appeared in camden these include back on the train sample in a jar ac dc bag squirming coil simple and carini chalkdust torture and fluffhead are somewhat over represented appearing 5 and 4 time out of 10 total show respectively 2001 is counted twice on 6 25 10 otherwise this number would be 32 let’s take a look at each show shall we 7 10 99 if you have only heard one show from camden it’s probably this one and if you’ve only heard one song from this show it’s probably the cdt rightly hailed a an absolute must hear at all cost top shelf jam this chalkdust is phenomenal it overshadows many other fine performance on this night among them an underrated gin a 20 minute tweezer a fine boaf and a strong finishing fluffhead to close out set 2 phish’s first show in camden may be their best officially released a live phish 8 7 3 00 the first of a two night run this show feature a fairly song based first set played in the midst of a big storm which includes another strong take on fluffhead set two open with a behemoth nearly 33 minute jim there is some down time in the middle of this big jam but the final third is more than worth the price of admission later a very strong theme show why this show isn’t just a one trick pony the sand lock into the 99 00 techno groove and your taste will dictate if it work for you or not overall a solid show 7 4 00 apart from some nice song choice lizard this holiday show is rather unremarkable in the first set set 2 however is another animal altogether in a year of strong jibboos this version might be the granddaddy of them all clocking in at 28 40 this multi part monster ha something for just about everybody not content with this centerpiece jam the band close the set with an outstanding combo the latter tune in particular is stellar and comparable in quality to 11 18 98’s masterful version 7 30 03 what’s that you were looking for a 4 song 2nd set i’ve got one right here and yet the arguable highlight of this show appears in set 1 with a that is in the conversation for best ever played set 1 also feature an average length cdt that pack a punch and a one off cover of dylan’s you ain’t goin’ nowhere set 2 look like this twist bug yem wotc twist and yem both trounce the 20 minute mark and are full of high quality improvisation if dark 2 0 phish is your bag you could do a lot worse than this show 7 31 03 the first set of 03’s night two is punctuated by an early moma that get even funkier than usual set 2 begin with a long piper that turn out to be somewhat restrained until the last 4 minute where it ramp up and then calm down once more with a into mike’s the ensuing paug is a fast paced jaunt with lot of full band interplay the set ending hood is a 26 minute type ii thriller that is easily among the best of 2 0 and well worth a listen 8 12 04 the final show before coventry and the crack are showing composed section are noticeably weak and improvisation while certainly present sometimes feel aimless frankly trey isn’t quite a engaged a one would like set 2 open with piper for the 2nd consecutive camden show and wind into an above average sally the that end the set is very 2 0 in style and your mileage may vary still worth checking out but not a show i find myself listening to frequently 6 7 09 phish may have made their return at hampton but this show is when many fan knew they were back this is not to say that there wasn’t still rust on the wheel there totally wa but the extended fee after an almost expected lyrical flub by trey wa a hint of what wa to come the sand that opened set 2 wa probably the first big jam of 3 0 and it retains much of it power especially in the last 5 minute many fan myself included would argue that the set ending 17 minute tweezer is the real mvp here a 4 song encore that includes an antelope tweeprise cap thing off this show ha been surpassed in 3 0 many time over but it provided a solid foundation for all that followed 6 24 10 looking at the setlist you’d think that this show must have something very special to offer dwd hood fluff and yem all in one set that’s crazy talk ala this is a garden variety 2010 show not that it’s especially bad the gumbo timber is nice a is dwd but this show never quite make it to the next level i will say this page did a great job with the rover to close set 1 i would have liked to see that led zep tune stay in the rotation but it wa one and done 6 25 10 certainly a step up from the previous night the band start off with a bang by launching into alumnus letter to jimmy page alumnus the rest of set 1 loses it way a bit free man in paris summer of 89 tte but set 2 kick off with a nice cdt before lulling out for a few tune then a very welcome 2001 emerges from the ether and the dance fest in on this is a tight very funky version that give way to some fun michael jackson tease and jam on the 1st anniversary of his death before resuming 2001 proper the billie

happened with the band in that time be safe out on tour and i’ll see you crazy kid in camden

1,there seems to be two major school of phish fan when it come to how their studio album and their signature sound are heard those who came in around junta lawnboy and those who came in around hoist dwd this may already be well covered but i wanted to share a it s something i have been thinking about for a while early adopter seem to generally rate junta or rift a there best studio album hoist era adopter seem to generally rate the best studio album a ghost with hoist phish took a turn from challenging prog rock and embraced more of a straight rock sound it wa still quirky jammy phish but it wa an obviously huge pivot point from their previous sound after hoist a more ballady and slower jamming phish emerged that s not to say that their slow down after the radio rocky hoist didn t produce more brilliance of it own i think that those of u who came in early came to expect the challenging prog sound of junta pon and rift and though we enjoy the post hoist music in it own right and may even have replaced junta rift with ghost or another a our favorite studio album our perspective and expectation of phish s sound revolves around our entry point prior to hoist fan who came in during hoist or after seem to have a very different perspective of the quintessential phish sound that made them so popular in the junta rift day not to say that is a negative thing it is simply different and i find it fascinating to imagine coming into phish from that angle

1,phish radio endless phish tailored to your liking hey reddit i posted here a few month ago announcing hose a new phish streaming app that includes a pretty cool feature i m surely biased though phish radio feedback form website i have been working on a phish streaming website very similar to phish in for the past year or so i pushed out a beta version a few month ago and since then have been working tirelessly on our main feature of the application phish radio if you login to the app currently only supporting facebook login we plan to get google login integrated soon a well the app will track your listening habit like and dislike and all that sort of thing the goal is to learn what you a a phish fan enjoy and recommend you song using a neural network pulling from the entire category of live phish 30 000 track that wa run through an audio feature extraction library this algorithm will essentially try and find similar sounding song that you enjoy and try to recommend them to you in a convenient endless radio feature this project is very exciting for me personally and i wa lucky enough to tie this project into my senior capstone project for a degree in computer science i m in the final stretch of the project in the context of school and need some people to provide some feedback on how the radio feature work out for them i m coming to you guy to ask for a big favor and possibly use the app and interact with it like some song that you enjoy browse the app and listen to some show but most importantly liking and disliking are key to the algorithm i even put in like button around the app so you can browse song and show and like song that you already know you love because we ve all got our favorite right anyway the goal of the phish radio feature is to have a neat feature that will just endlessly play you phish i ve been using this at work when i don t want to constantly be jumping back and forth to pick the next song that i want to play hopefully you guy will enjoy it a much a i have been p the radio feature will still work if you re not logged in but don t expect anything special if you are not logged in it will just pull from a list of song that are tagged with jamcharts aka widely recognized a good song by the community so even that use case is pretty nice to get a nice playlist of top track sorry for the lengthy post you can check out the app there fill out the feedback form in a week or so and hopefully enjoy it

1,how did you start listening to phish young phan 20 who started listening my senior year of high school but when i heard my first phish song i could not have guessed what an impact this music would have on me i would love to hear how you all started listening word of mouth from when they first started out lucky enough to be in nectar s in the early day friend drag you to a concert or just by chance a for me i always listened to everything from the 60 to the 90 and thanks to my parent became a huge classic rock fan one day we were having a garage sale to clear out all the shit in our basement and there were a ton of old cd s i had already raided this stash a few time before but only looking for name i knew before we sold the cd s we felt weren t good enough or didn t want i wa picking through it one last time in case i missed anything wound up scoring skynyrd s one more from the road and floyd s pulse live show but then my dad handed me one more cd and go here check these guy out they kind of took over the mantle for the dead after jerry died so a a pretty avid deadhead i took it with high expectation that album just so happened to be billy breathes now i immediately fell in love with it and when i heard free and theme it hit me right in that musical sweetspot but i didn t quite get how they took over the dead s mantle eventually i decided to listen to a live show and that s when i had my mind implode and everything i thought i knew about music changed ever since i ve listened non stop and phish ha quickly risen to the height of my favorite band and will remain there for the rest of my life probably not a glorious a a story a the vet here but i just wanted to share to anybody willing to listen please share your story below i would love to hear about it

1,let s discus scent subtle sound if this post is successful there will surely be more in the future the object is to get different point of view on the meaning of lyric scent subtle sound is lyrically in my top 3 of favorite phish tune which is why i decided to start with it commenting with your favorite version is encouraged so without further ado if you would stop and notice that we number every day but allow the many moment left uncounted slip away you don t have to count them just enjoy them one by one then thing would take a different hue and sparkle in the sun the wind would lift you up in to the sky the wind would lift you up in to the sky above where you would see a trail of treasured memory you love a rainbow record of the thought and moment you ve enjoyed arc behind the earth a spectral color in the void scent and subtle sound color in the void here s my take the 1st verse speak of the indoctrination of the entire human race by way of number specifically with the clock and calendar everyone blindly slave away to these concept and accepts it at normal the idea of stamping a number on each and every moment is something that wa forced upon u and we were left with no choice but to abide by it the 2nd verse talk about how we have the power to free ourselves from these constraint however doing so is obviously easier said than done if you can achieve this freedom then the wind would lift you up in to the sky it would assist u in our journey to spiritual ascension and shed a different light on what it mean to be a human the 3rd verse is tricky to me it is somewhat of a fantasy of what would happen if you were to free yourself favorite version chicago 2017 summer tour although i have the i wa there bias it really take off right around the 9 minute mark it s placement in the set wa nothing short of perfection what doe this song mean to you doe it remind you of any cherished memory do you have a different interpretation than i do i d love to hear about it thanks in advance for your response edit the formatting of lyric is weird and i can t figure out how to fix it

1,would there be any interest in a phish show of the day subreddit for a long time of been toying with the idea of listening to and cataloging every phish show in existence obviously a monumental task i ve also thought that it would be a much more rewarding experience if there were other folk listening along and discussing so the idea is that every day a new show would be posted in it s own thread and everyone could listen through at their leisure and post thought opinion observation this wouldn t be a best of the best listening experience a fall 97 show could be followed by some 1989 dud the idea would be to slowly work through the entirety of the band s catalog participation would obviously be voluntary so you could join in and take break a desired listen a few day late whatever and still be an active participant we could start off haphazardly at first but move on to following anniversary tour have vote guest pick etc maybe after a few month this would take on some kind of structure that i haven t even thought of yet i have no desire to be the sole pick master so hopefully we d ultimately settle on some collaborative or rotating system anyway if anyone would be interested in this let me know and i ll try to set something up

1,mike s izabella tease in baker s dozen simple this should fire up the baker s dozen simple from a few second before the aforementioned tease the actual timestamp of the tease is 05 17 17 using the baker s dozen mega mix video so the mass can enjoy soundboard quality that izabella is teased in this jam is not news note an izabella tease but doesn t attribute it to one of the band member trey tease izabella in the beginning of this jam probably about 10 minute earlier i sent this mike tease to the guy and got no response so maybe i m just late to the party on this revelation but hot damn this is probably the coolest tease i ve ever heard while building tension up to one of the highest high of the baker s dozen with trey in the throe of a full rock bliss moment cactus reverts back to the izabella bassline for the final two measure of the chord progression one last bit of creative tension before the release ha anyone else heard this the answer to that question in this community is usually yes nevertheless let s appreciate mike

1,2 sad phish dream in one night i rarely have any dream related to phish but i had two last night that were rather nightmarish the first is short i went on facebook and saw people talking about seeing phish in october then i went on and phish had announced the baker’s dozen 2 fall tour i wa sad because i’m gonna be in school all fall that’s a selfish reason but it okay bc in the dream i just decided to drop out the second is longer i’ll preface by saying i have ticket to bcga and the forum this summer but i still have to confirm i can stay with my grandma in sf so the dream start and i’m in bcga rocking out on the floor sadly i wa in the furthest back corner really far from the stage i realized i wa focusing way too much on the people around me and not enough on the band this happened to me during 12 31 17 set 1 bc wooks took over my aisle it’s at this point i focus on the music and realize they are about 10 minute into divided sky i’ve been dying to see divided sky live so i wa really mad at myself how could i miss the whole first part and the pause i had a realization that month had gone by so fast it felt like i went straight from march to july 24th i wa mad i had missed tahoe and couldn’t figure out how i let that happen but then i realized something much worse i had forgotten to tell my grandma i wa in town and that i needed a place to stay this is where it turned nightmarish and i felt intense fear the second set ended after divided and i moved up to a better spot on the floor then sat through the encore can’t remember what it wa worrying about what i would do afterwards i hurried out of the venue and into a really shitty and old looking part of sf i tried to call my grandma and my aunt but got no answer i looked around and realized i should’ve gone out the other exit that’s where downtown wa i go downtown to my friend’s hotel room he is staying on the floor of the room and they tell me there isn’t any room for 1 more i go out onto the balcony and call my sister i ask her what the date is she is confused but she say it’s may 25 duh and at that point i am relieved and i say thank god you gotta help me i’m stuck in a dream where it’s july 24th and i have no place to stay in sf i’m just a short young white boy and it’s chilly tonight what do i do the dream end at this point the fact that it wa cold and i only had a t shirt on must stem from nye this year and how fucking cold it wa after the show i had that feeling that i wa gonna have to be alone in the cold again anyway i’m excited for summer tour and i think i’ll call my grandma today to confirm i can stay there have you ever not had a place to stay after a show what’d you do

1,audiophiles did you become an audiophile collector after discovering phish or did being an audiophile collector bring you upon phish just curious a far back a i can remember really beginning to explore where different type of music could take me towards the end of high school i always knew of phish and the grateful dead and how iconic they were and the following they had and i listened to some of their music here and there through friend but i never went out of my way to listen to it alone around this time i wa jumping on all the new interesting music coming out on pitchfork etc and wound up getting a little deep into edm i d always though electronic music wa a little phony but that wa with literally no experience with it other than thinking raver dance party i ll say it edm is the first music that i liked enough to get my as out of my house and go to a show so for my first couple of year it wa a gradual evolution of various dubstep edm artist to more electrofunk type music like sts9 and lotus around this time i wa growing more and more appreciation for string and oragnic music but not necessarily kicking edm out altogether the thing i loved about sts9 lotus and some other edm act is that they recorded and put out for download all of their live show i d heard of the dead and phish doing this but i never realized how cool it actually is in between all this music listening i kind of still had the dead and phish set aside a already confirmed great so there wa not much need for me to go exploring there oh how wrong i wa at this point i wa getting really into string cheese because i love their blend of bluegrass rock jam and the edm can be ok sometimes too since lotus and sts9 are more electro ish band i d never found a band like this where you can go to multiple of their show and hear only a few of the same song but never in the same way at this point i wa chasing that high of different set list and missing song and around my 30th cheese show i started feeling like they couldn t keep up with me no disrespect to the cheese they are amazing and will always have a special place in my heart but some of their musical decision and mash ups leave me thinking hmmm ok i guess around the time of my 30th cheese show about half a year earlier my best friend in the world passed away he wa the biggest phish fan i know brought into the scene by amazing people and he continually tried to get me to go with him i did several time and had a great time every time with him for some reason i just wanted to stay focused on string cheese with a few of my other friend i regret that now anyway since his passing i made an effort to look into everything he told me to look into and make phish my 1 and i haven t looked back since not only do i love phish because they are extremely talented and diverse enough to never leave you bored but now i feel like i get to be with my friend every show i get i m lucky enough to have access to all of phish s soundboard recording and just listening to the show s i ve been at with him and some i even haven t evoke more emotion in me than i ever though possible by music i love that i always have something to remind me of the amazing time i have at their show now i ve got trey band coming up at the end of april and georgia and curveball in august this band is connected to me in so many way i never thought would be possible anyway sorry for babbling on just wanted to share my story and see if there are any other audiophiles out there that stumbled upon phish and never looked back

1,phish phan re entry i started listening to phish back in 96 when i discovered junta went to some show in 98 and then 2003 so it been a while ha the band grown changed and what album show can properly introduce me to the new era thanks
1,listened through all of 98 here are my thought aka the sequel to the 97 this time i decided to jot more note down about the show a i go along i ve only been a phish fan for a couple year so i m no expert but hopefully my observation will be of some kind of use anywho on to the note island tour this condensed tour is a strong 4 night run and a fan favourite at this point trey s tone ha changed from what i heard in the 97 recording and is a bit more heavy fuzzy i think the jamming is getting looser a well and includes more ambient excursion the 2nd and 3rd night are my favourite especially set ii of 4 4 by the beginning of the summer european tour it s clear that ghost is maturing and changing it ha more distinctive flavour in each performance rather than only being a vehicle for launching funk jam moma dance go through some interesting change too not only are lyric and a small dance added to what wa originally an instrumental i e black eyed katy but they are exploring new direction for the vibe of the song and the jamming in it despite what seems to be an increasing number of mistake in performing the song arrangement and the presence of several larger fiasco e g the drunken flub of 7 5 or the sound system issue on 7 10 there are still plenty of great jamming moment in the euro tour the 7 6 ghost and piper and 7 9 tweezer and drowned offer some intense peak the summer u s tour certainly ha some interesting show the setlists include more cover and bustouts than usual some are played better than others the colonel on 8 7 is somewhat messy for instance while the terrapin station on 8 9 is well played and garner enthusiastic reception from fan a strong hometown show for fishman at vernon down wrap up the tour and it s on to lemonwheel phish soundchecks can sometimes feel like nice little show unto themselves the lemonwheel soundcheck is certainly no exception being full of straight up groove and funk i recommend giving it a listen the rest of the festival continues the laid back and fun vibe and includes great rendition of moma dance divided sky reba gumbo tweezer ghost fluffhead 2001 and hood throughout october there are several television appearance the performance are mostly standard but there are some unique moment during farm aid fishman go nut on moma dance and neil young join in for several song including a free form jam after runaway jim which lead into a lengthy down by the river full video is on the bridge school benefit show are acoustic set and feature some beautiful and unique arrangement for those who like acoustic possum free bird hood and sad lisa are just some of the song worth checking out and maybe it s just me but brian and robert s lyric about leading a lonely and difficult life seem to take on a new context given the venue trey even turned around to look at the kid on stage before starting the song video are on youtube of both night and night the session at west 54th taping is a more intimate setting with nice version of ghost guyute driver and taste full video is available on the show wa hosted by david byrne and there wa an interview with the band also on much ha been said about the halloween show the first set ha some great type i jam including sneakin sally cdt and weekapaug the second set is mostly straightforward with a few song getting some extra mustard and an interesting jam emerging out of lonesome cowboy bill the third set is quite strange with a lot of dark ambient exploration and trey infamously walking off the stage during ghost the album filler for the livephish release are from the previous night and include a smoothly segued jam sequence the 11 2 show in utah is also unique and well known though for different reason the story go that they decided to do the surprise cover of pink floyd s dark side of the moon a a treat for the few in attendance and a reminder to everyone else not to miss out of the way show the result is probably a stronger halloween costume show than the more uneven one a few day prior the band waste no time getting into serious jamming with the opening there are other highlight such a an extended limb by limb and a yem with a lengthy ambient intro but the album cover is what the show is famous for and dsotm is well played especially considering the fact that they learned it at the last minute the november show are varied in quality the trend of lengthier ambient excursion continues but there is also some high energy machine gun playing from time to time the hampton show aka hampton come alive don t have a lot of deep jam but are fun and silly 11 27 wa another official release a live phish 06 and is an excellent show featuring many wipe out tease and jam the nye run at madison square garden is a strong send off for

1,opinion on cash or trade this is completely anecdotal but i think cash or trade is too overpopulated and established to be a friendlier alternative to the second hand market for folk new to the service advising a r phish user to go there is basically pointless there are far too many member that have 100 5 star review for a seller to give any one new on that site the time of day i ve been through this now with nye and currently with this tour i have gold have alert and respond quickly i get no response because i have no review why should i be trusted when custymcgee just messaged the same seller and ha 100 5 star review from previous transaction stubhub and their competitor all suck and buying and selling at face is commendable but the barrier to entry at cash or trade is too large telling people here to go there isn t really helpful anymore not salty i got most my ptbms and will find my missing piece elsewhere no issue just wanted to leave my review a a newer former cot user

1,david welker the maze poster release head up phriends david welker is dropping his maze print tomorrow wednesday 2 21 at noon the here is the text from the email a little over 25 year ago i had the great pleasure of working with the band phish on their concept album titled rift it wa a rare chance to work intimately with these four legendary musician when they were still getting fan mail in a shoe box when it wa proposed that there would be this main character lying diagonally in a bed i wa struck with the literalness of it so straight away i put myself headlong into it i wa the guy lying diagonally in the bed doing my best impression of martin sheen s post saigon meltdown in apocalypse now and fittingly i wa in the midst of a breakup during the whole creative process this album spoke to me in so many way over the year and i just couldn t help but feel there wa some strange almost mystical connection going on i m sure i m not alone though so now i find myself revisiting this room this strange house and wondering what it would look like if the maze came to life what would it feel like to still be inside the maze 25 year later the woman is in the doorway is she staying or is she leaving it wa the story of my life for a while perhaps the man finally chooses love and is released from the maze at this moment the man in the bed appears like a sort of rip van winkle character rowing a boat diagonally across the sheet which have now turned to a rushing torrent of water if the morning ever come the album would seem to suggest that love prevails so there is a lot of dynamic tension in this piece but all the while there is serenity in the face of the man and calm in the woman and peace in the distance i began this drawing process 11 month ago and i feel like i lived another micro lifetime again a the main character letting the piece tell me what it wanted to become it s a much the story of my life a it is the continuing story of the song and countless other soul who have journeyed with this band and their amazing legacy the maze color giclee edition archival pigment on 305gsm cold press cotton rag paper with deckled edge 28 x 21 inch signed and numbered edition of 700 145 the maze silver screen print edition screen print with metallic ink 30 x 21 inch signed and numbered edition of 250 225 the maze letterpress edition one color letterpress 20 x 14 inch signed and numbered edition of 150 275 the maze pencil giclee edition archival pigment on 305gsm cold press cotton rag paper with deckled edge 22 x 16 inch signed and numbered edition of 150 275

1,theory trey s languedoc guitar is named jimmy page this theory ha been developed around several clue which trey ha been dropping since halloween 1994 revolving around the beatles song glass below is a quote from the entry on glass onion an altered lyric and an alternate implication phish covered the third tune on the beatles’ white album on halloween 1994 rather than remind u of the fool on the hill trey chose to inform u i told you bout guyute the pig i tell you man he’s dancin’ a jig additionally the walrus apparently wasn’t a mccartney he wa a languedoc a trey so indicated by pointing back to the soundboard at the appropriate time trey make it clear that in this case that the paul he s referring to in the line the walrus wa paul wa not paul mccartney but paul languedoc the builder of his guitar this is the first of three instance some iteration of this phrase wa spoken by trey the second instance came twenty one year later at dick 2015 inside of harpua trey say here s a little hint for you the walrus wa page now one would assume that the page in question is the chairman of the board himself but the next occurrence of the line add a new meaning hold the tannis root the forest’s tasty nectar shoot the sun tip off the monarch’s suit from sequined sash to shiny boot here’s another clue for you all the monarch wa wilson here’s another clue for you all the walrus wa jimmy this wa said on the jimmie night of the baker dozen during fly famous mockingbird so now when we look at each reference to glass onion we get that the walrus wa simultaneously paul languedoc page and jimmy how could that be possible unless all three are referencing the same thing the walrus is jimmy page and jimmy page is the languedoc and the languedoc is the walrus tl dr trey ha been leaving clue in the beatles glass onion about the name of his guitar probably maybe

1,what i love about phish so i m finally watching my stream of the new year s show watching trey jump up and down a he belt out fuego and wa thinking you know how music is like the purest form of communication and phish are up there literally blasting out their feeling over amplifier and it s such a strong sensation that you the audience can t help but empathize with them and share in their feeling and what phish is feeling is how fucking psyched they are to be here man that s the best feeling edit not to mention the fact that they re also getting pummeled by our good vibe and it creates a feedback loop of love and light

1,timeline history of the current jam scene since getting into phish about half a decade ago i ve become pretty familiar with a lot of other band in the jam scene and something that i ve always been curious about and don t really know much on is a general timeline of the evolution of the scene i m talking like which band gained popularity and or peaked around what year etc for example it is my understanding that phish got a big influx of fan when jerry passed which propelled them to the top of the scene and during both of phish s subsequent break other jam band gained significant fan wa it all at once where are some of these band on their current trajectory they ve all faced bump and change i know cheese ha changed their sound a lot and added member and bisco changed their drummer in the early 2000 s how were these change taken by their fan it seems like some band like cheese umph and moe have all seen much better day a far a crowd but umph is still going pretty strong whereas cheese seems to be slowing down were band like lotus ever big or did they just kind of slide into the mid tier over time i guess if you know a lot about any of these specific band a little perspective is much appreciated because at this point i m mostly familiar with all of their music but not their history

1,just getting into phish album recommendation i ve been a deadhead my whole life and jam band fan for a long time i ve always been a little turned off by the goofy ness of a lot of phish song but i recently listened to a mid 90 show for the first time and i have to say i m hooked and i can definitely get over my initial aversion to their lyrical style not everyone can have hunter writing for them and that s okay with the dead i liked the way that i fell in love with their studio work then wa blown away hearing the song i adore stretched into a 20 minute musical improv soup i d like to experience phish in the same way unless y all think it completely unnecessary and wa wondering in y all had any favorite studio work that i can familiarize myself with before diving into the rabbit hole of live show also are there any definitive smokin or special live show that i should check out once i m ready thanks edit seriously thanks guy you ve officially got me converted if you ve got anything else keep it coming but i appreciate the guidance this band ha a whole lot more diversity and complexity than i ever gave them credit for

1,my funny phish story i know we probably see too many of these post on here and i ve shared a few in the past but thinking about watkins glen this summer reminded me of a funny story that happened to me at magnaball i did much of the summer 2015 tour solo and found it to be a refreshing and cathartic experience i roll into magnaball healthy happy and ready to get down i decide to eat some paper on night 2 and had a blast although i probably did a little too much for a 40 something year old i go back to my campsite glen close after the drive in set and am waiting for my new friend to arrive so we can commiserate about what the hell just happened i had been sitting for a bit when some spun dude walk into my camp and sits down he start straight in asking me where my drug are i politely tell him that i have none he then asks me where my money is i tell him i don t have any keep in mind that i m barely holding it together a it is and some dude is trying to fuck with me or even worse rob me i decide that he s just wasted and i should get him out of my campsite i m in no condition to fight him so i tell him i know where we can find drug and money right now follow me my intention wa to walk him to the camp gate then disappear into the crowd around the tunnel here s where it get weird a we re walking he slide behind me and start talking to himself saying stuff like i can t believe i m gonna have to stab this guy why won t he just do what i m telling him to do i m gonna cut his fucking throat i pick up the pace and a we get to the secure gate for glen close camping i get behind him push him out into the crowd past the security guard and yell he doesn t belong here imposter a i turn tail and run a fast a i could back to my camp when i get to the camp my neighbor have arrived and i tell them the story in my altered state i could sense that they re calling b on me so i sulked into my tent for the night this would be a good time to end the story but no the next morning i wake up to a weird feeling in my face i exit the tent and my new friend actually gasped at my appearance he said holy shit dude your face is fucked my left eye wa completely swollen shut super puffy i put ice on it and it kept getting worse apparently i wa bitten by a spider or something in my tent at this point i had to make the decision to call it a weekend and drive the 7 hour back home i m bummed to miss night three but didn t want to risk it getting worse so i m leaving the festival headed to the highway and there is a state police blockade stopping every car and searching a few i m fucked i just know it i start sweating the acid is kicking back in a little and i m obsessing about how i look like rocky dennis leaving a phish show the trooper come up to my car take one look at me and say what the hell happened to you man i told him i thought i wa bit by a spider he just nod and i wait to be told to pull over and searched he keep nodding and i ask him sir what do you want me to do he asks me to pull over and i see my freedom slipping away he call some of his buddy over they each take a turn leaning in the car to look at my face then they all laugh and one say man i think you ve had enough this weekend safe travel tl dr wa almost murdered at my campsite got bit by a critter and laughed at by cop best show ever no superpower edit ok not funny but weird strange disconcerting abnormal dude wa definitely having an issue episode i m sure someone took care of him it s phish geez y all can be so damn serious

1,trey s close friend chris cottrell passed away from cancer link to fb post for the smart people without facebook my lifelong friend chris cottrell died tonight from adrenal cancer my heart is truly broken he leaf two beautiful daughter ayla and kiara his loving wife amanda and two brother hamm and trow chris wa a deeply caring father husband and friend and at the same time chris wa a true badass a tough a nail on the outside while inside he had the biggest heart of anyone i’ve ever known chris and i were like blood brother from the age of 15 chris wa always the first friend who would call when time were hard he always knew exactly what to say and more importantly what not to say he wa also hilarious and right up until his last day wa cracking all of u up including his nurse who all loved him he died surrounded by his loved one in the comfort of his home chris wa a wicked skier and in the early 90 the four of u in phish even sponsored him when he competed in the extreme skiing competition he planned on skiing the competition in fish’s dress naked underneath with the dress flapping up in the air a he went down the mountain that didn’t actually end up happening but we all had a good laugh picturing it and he did well in the competition that year despite wearing regular ski clothes chris loved elk and deer hunting in colorado and especially loved spending long hour above the tree line he loved being up in the mountain he also loved surfing and he and amanda loved spending time in costa rica surfing and being by the ocean when our kid were all little chris took our family on 3 day rafting and camping trip out west we’d go kayaking and he wa also an expert fly fisherman he would take me fishing and i would never catch anything while chris would end up with 12 fish it wa like he could sense where they were hiding behind the rock he wa in tune chris’s fingerprint can be found on the world of phish and tab if you look in the liner note of the live tab album plasma you’ll see that chris wa a co producer helping me pick which track would make the cut the song push on till the day is packed with reference to our countless adventure together it begin with the line c cott is a friend of mine and among other thing it includes a reference to the back of the worm which wa heard at a phish show at the paradiso in amsterdam in 97 but actually came from the night before that when chris and i were wandering aimlessly thru the dark street of amsterdam at 3am completely lost and cracking up when we both suddenly stopped in our track and realized at exactly the same moment that there were giant 100 foot long sand worm swimming just below the surface of the water in the canal right next to u it wa a horrifying thing to realize but there wa nothing we could do the worm were there and that wa the end of it so i looked sheepishly at chris and sort of mumbled i think you know where you are and he replied you’re on the back of the worm which started u off laughing whispering back and forth a we walked quickly away i think you know where you are you’re on the back of the worm the chant continued all night and into the next day right up onto the stage the next night stuff like that used to happen all the time with chris he lived in boulder in the 80 and early 90 and whenever phish would come to town which wa quite a lot we had a ritual where we would circumnavigate the entire city of boulder walking for hour at night just talking and laughing chris and i both loved jimi hendrix so much and we would always crank band of gypsy or red house or some other jimi track on the stereo when we were together really loud standing in front of the speaker together and chris whose nickname for me a stain because my last name is anastasio which morphed into ain stain which morphed into stainus on the ainus and then into simply stain would lean into my face while jimi ripped at ear bleeding volume and he would yell stain listen to that sustain meaning not just sustain of one note but the way jimi always kept the energy flowing like a torrent like whitewater rafting how he would sustain a roaring rapid of sustain so when i walked onstage at the countless show where chris would be hanging backstage he would always say to me just a i walked out stain sustaaaiiiin even when he couldn’t be at the show i’d often call or text him before the show and say co taage my nickname for him taaage is pronounced taj like in taj mahal i’m gonna sustaaiiin and he’d say something like well done grasshopper if you are ever in crested butte there are many gorgeous home in that town that chris built he had his own construction company and built beautiful luxury home including his own which wa breathtaking and always spotlessly clean for the last decade of his life chris wa a grower in california he loved and cared for his plant like a doting father like they were his baby watering and spraying for hour and hour every evening and early morning building solar powered watering system or special air transfer and lighting system for the indoor grow dealing with pest weather change etc he always took enormous pride in everything he did and it showed and of course he wa a caring loving expert a a grower too mostly chris loved amanda deeply and unconditionally they had a rare and beautiful relationship he wa unwavering in his love for her and she for him it wa such a heartwarming thing to witness when he got sick all he ever talked to me about other than how proud he wa of his beautiful daughter wa amanda and how he wished she did not have to go thru this this post is way too long so forgive me but i guess i don’t care because i’m so heartbroken and i just want to share one more memory if you will indulge me sometime in the mid 90 mike wa driving up the highway when he picked up the actor courtney gaines hitchhiking courtney wa well known for playing the character of malachi in child of the corn with his wild red hair he wa the one who hacked everybody up mike started to contemplate a crazy gag and at band practice and the gag came into focus so the next time we played in vega we rented a giant suite with a balcony and a piano and we invited ton of friend to a huge party in the room mike even hired two opera singer the gag wa this courtney and i bought the exact same clothes because with my long red hair at the time courtney and i looked similar we each bought an identical bright blue blazer pant and shoe chris wa chosen to be the target of the gag because this wa going to be so scary that we needed a person who wouldn’t have a heart attack when it happened and chris wa literally the only person we could think of who would be able to withstand it after taking some mushroom just to add to the fun i took chris out gambling for a couple of hour while the party raged on in the room chris of course had no idea that courtney wa there i wa supposed to bring him back at exactly 2 45 am which i did when chris and i got back to the room everyone had left and we were alone even though secretly they were all hiding up on the balcony looking down at u there wa a large screen tv placed in front of the couch and child of the corn wa playing on the tv chris and i sat down on the couch it wa very dark in the room except for the light from the tv and just a we sat down courtney begin hacking furiously with that weird curved blade thing and horror music blaring at that moment i excused myself to go to the bathroom courtney and i switched in the bathroom and courtney returned to my seat on the couch dressed in the exact same clothes i’d been wearing wearing my glass with his shaggy red hair and sat right down next to chris the whole party and the opera singer who were instructed to scream at the top of their lung at the exact moment that chris screamed were watching from above adding to the weirdness wa the fact that courtney is a professional actor so he sat down next to chris on the couch and then turned and made eye contact with him with a horribly scary i’m gonna kill you face that i could see from the bathroom and wa so scary that even i wa scared this wa only moment after i had been sitting next to chris in the exact same spot and meanwhile in the background movie courtney wa hacking up a storm with the movie cued to the exact worst spot chris stood up and started slowly backing away in terror and confusion trying to get a handle on what wa happening at which point i sort of panicked because i felt worried that it wa just all too much so i ran out thinking i’d make it would easier for him but in reality that’s when he really lost it because now there were two of me in the dark dressed identically but one wa malaki anyway my favorite part of this whole story is that by the next night courtney and chris had become pal and while we were playing the show i kept seeing the two of them running around drinking and partying together it wa the primus halloween harpua show and that say more about chris than anything he loved the whole thing we will all miss you chris

1,this is my favorite thing about the phish phamily so last weekend wa pretty lonely i wa sitting in the house all weekend and i had to get out on sunday afternoon i decided to shower up and go to the local bar to get a beer some taco and some human interaction i called up three of my best friend to ask if they wanted to join all three of them declined only making me feel that much more alone i wa going to go regardless of their answer while at the bar i wa wearing my treasured lucky phish hat i wa sitting there watching the human interaction around me and enjoying my first beer while waiting on my taco order to be cooked when a guy in his late 40’s i’m 24 came up to me on his way to the restroom and said duuuuude i love the phish hat and pointed at his buddy sitting a few seat away from me and his buddy proceeded to stretch his shirt out so i could see that dead and co wa written on it and he then gave me a thumb up this instantly brightened up my lonely weekend there wa a couple sitting between the old head and me at the bar and the couple didn’t leave until i finished my taco and my first beer which wa when i planned on leaving once i saw the couple leave i said to myself fuck it i’m so lonely and i scooted over a few bar stool to where i wa now sitting next to the old head i ended up having such a blast with them i had a few more beer while we talked about everything there is to talk about good music we talked about how they used to see phish back in the beginning of the 90’s when they would just be playing at small bar and stuff like the bar we were at and i wa blown away hearing that i told them they need to understand how blessed they are because a a 24 year old my chance are very slim of ever getting to see a band like phish at a venue that small in my lifetime they talked about how they followed the dead around in the final year with jerry they gave me general life advice being that they had 20 year on me we laughed we drank we had a killer time there wa just so much that we talked about that i can’t fit it in this post but put it this way i drank 4 beer and i never drink so that’s a lot for me i wa there for a while in conclusion this is why i love phish pham we are one massive family of brother and sister we have yet to even meet in many case if you often feel lonely and wish you had more friend that jam out like you wear some phish gear in public thank you if you read this far i love each and every one of you beautiful soul tl dr i wa having a very lonely weekend wore my lucky phish hat alone to a bar ended up meeting two fellow phish head through them seeing my hat and we had a great evening together and they my brother in phish helped cure my loneliness

1,what up pham i want to ask you guy i ve been a phan for about 20 year seen about 20 show love machine gunner trey cactus henrietta and page a musician i think that kuroda is the best lighting guy to have ever lived vacuum cleaner is my favorite instrument i have a huge scar on my face from a glow stick etc recently i heard a story that i couldn t believe a work acquaintance who know that i like phish told me something very unsettling about mike gordon he told me how he had to pay off parent of a very young little girl for taking inappropriate picture of her this happened to her alone with him in a secluded boathouse i thought dude wa cray so i went online and dug around unfortunately it doe appear to be the case i wa floored then disgusted i have talked to others who have known about it and all i got wa a lot of denial backpedaling and rationalization one guy quoting woody allen said to me the heart want what the heart want wtf seriously i am a open minded a anyone but i draw a very hard line when it come to minor this girl wasn t just a minor but a very young girl gordon who is not related to her should have never even been with her alone in such a secluded place not that they are to blame but what were her parent even thinking when they allowed it also did they at least know that mike wa even going to do a photo shoot alone with their kid in a secluded boathouse please tell me he didn t just snatch her up and take her there i have run this through my head over and over there is no reason for a grown man to ever take picture of an unrelated small child all alone i have child this is horrifying the scariest part about it is the number of people that seem okay with it with all the news about hollywood lately everyone seems to be outraged with this type of behavior yet i never even heard about the accusation against mike gordon or of the settlement he paid her parent until now why the conspiracy of silence i get that the dude is a good bassist but i will never spend another cent supporting his work i am thoroughly disgusted you guy should be too hurting a child is unforgivable gordon is a very sick and twisted man any thought on the subject

1,phish recommendation system i need your help community you re my only hope note this is a really long post and reading isn t your thing i won t be offended but if you do take the time to read and respond with care it would make me one happy guy tldr define the main genre s phish play and provide the song that represents that genre eg funk black eyed katy 11 16 96 part 2 tldr do the gumbo result make sense nobody know phish s catalog like you guy do i listen to phish day in and day out and still would not consider myself an expert that s why i need the community s feedback a a whole if you guy remember my last post here about a month ago i am building a desktop app phish streaming service with a machine learning recommendation system built into it there are many step to this process we are currently on step 1 of the learning phase which is placing every single song phish ha ever played live into cluster based on how similar they sound to each other the last few day have consisted of putting month of theory into practice for a few trial to see how well this actually doe computing 30 000 song in addition to downloading them all over the network is going to take day and possibly even week i need two thing from you guy in order to both verify this process and make it better for the final run where we analyze every song together first if you read the following section first this may make more sense to you however here s the killer question phish obviously dip their toe into many genre straight up rock funk bluegrass jazz composition the list go on how would you a a fan classify their main genre eg pick 5 6 or however many you think really represent them in a meaningful way then for each of those genre what song would you say is the pinnacle or quintessential phish song of them playing that genre eg bluegrass blue and lonesome jazz reba funk black eyed katy etc it would be infinitely more helpful if you could state the actual date of the quintessential song that you list for example black eyed katy from 11 16 97 what i am essentially looking for is a way to divide phish song into x number of group and by choosing the song that represents that group we will be able to get much more accurate result what better way to find out what the community want and would enjoy than getting it from the community itself second my initial test after making sure everything mostly work wa with my favorite song of all time gumbo i chose this song because there is certainly a clear distinction between earlier version especially with the giant country horn sitting in and the late 90 s funkified version to break down how this process is working to any non technical people out there i chose three gumbo to be the center of their cluster 8 7 96 red rock gumbo standard 5 minute straightforward gumbo 7 21 91 arrowhead ranch gumbo giant country horn and 8 3 98 deer creek funk gumbo since there wa a sample size of 98 total gumbo 3 cluster should be enough to see if we are getting any meaningful result in each group the result will be at the bottom so the text doesn t get bogged down what i am asking of you guy is given the chosen song do the song that land in that group seem to have some correlation between the way they sound for example looking through myself in section 3 the funk gumbo that boise 9 14 99 and many 1997 gumbo fall into that group so that may indicate a successful analysis if you see anything that seems out of the ordinary perhaps a gumbo with horn that ended up in the funk group please point that out cluster 1 the arrow head ranch horn gumbo 1995 12 09 1995 10 07 1995 12 28 1990 09 29 1996 07 23 1996 10 19 1996 11 11 1996 12 30 1998 10 15 2000 09 09 2003 07 22 2009 06 09 2010 08 14 2010 07 03 2010 12 30 2011 06 12 2010 06 24 2013 07 17 2013 10 23 2013 12 29 1996 08 14 2014 10 28 2016 12 30 1994 06 16 1994 06 22 1994 07 09 1994 07 15 1994 10 13 1994 12 02 1994 12 03 1993 04 21 1991 07 21 1991 07 12 1991 07 14 1991 07 19 cluster 2 red rock standard gumbo 1991 07 25 1995 12 04 1995 10 20 1995 10 29 1990 09 28 1990 10 01 1990 11 30 1996 08 07 1997 08 13 1997 08 08 1997 11 14 1997 12 03 1998 07 17 1998 08 15 1998 11 11 1998 11 19 1998 11 28 1999 07 26 1999 07 03 1999 10 01 1999 12 13 2000 06 14 2000 07 07 2000 09 27 2004 04 16 2004 06 20 2009 11 27 2009 03 07 2011 08 17 2012 06 16 2012 06 23 2012 08 24 2011 05 28 2014 07 08 2014 08 03 2015 01 01 2015 08 05 2016 06 28 2016 10 29 2017 07 26 cluster 3 funk deer creek gumbo 1994 06 30 1995 07 02 1995 06 14 1995 06 28 1995 11 14 1996 11 16 1996 12 02 1997 02 20 1997 07 29 1997 11 26 1998 08 03 1999 09 14 2009 08 11 2010 10 19 2011 09 04 2012 07 04 2012 07 08 2013 08 04 2013 08 31 2014 07 20 1994 10 22 1993 04 16 if you made it this far thanks for reading it really mean a lot

1,a letter to phish and the beautiful community that surround them a the 20th anniversary of my first phish show wa approaching i wanted to let the band know how much i appreciated the last 20 year while writing this it went from a thank you letter to the band to a thank you letter to the band and the community so on top of mailing it to the band i am also going to post it online if you’re reading this please know that whether or not you’re a member of the band and old fan or a new fan i am glad glad glad that you’re alive and i am so excited to see what the next 20 year brings here go during the mid ninety on the shore of lake winnipesaukee a a camper in the junior division of my camp i first heard the band phish it wa shortly after the release of a live one and while i enjoyed it quite a bit it did not hit me a hard a neil young’s decade which i had also been introduced to when i went home i fell in love with harvest after the gold rush and rust never sleep and did not think much of phish other than to play the bootlegged tape i made of a live one when i returned to my summer residence under the pine i wa greeted by chris wesley an overzealous counselor who seemed to love one thing more than more than camp the band phish he spent the first day helping u adjust to cabin life deal with homesickness and dubbing phish concert tape he borrowed from resident deadhead counselor clark while chris would eventually become a doctor he wa first and foremost a story teller chris had an anecdote for every situation and even though we knew the vast majority were clearly conceived on the spot we hung off of every detail one of my favorite aspect of camp wa the musical alarm clock you woke up and cleaned the cabin to the counselor’s boom box selection you ate after mess call and you silently reflected in your bunk a the bugle blew tap at night usually post tap the counselor would head out in to the night leaving u to talk quietly and often inappropriately amongst ourselves until we could no longer keep our eye open for chris this wa his show time he would play u live version of phish song tell elaborate story about their origin and occasionally recreate the light show of chris kuroda with stick of incense moving swiftly in sync with the music in the pitch black cabin in the following almost 25 year i have read many of the origin of these song and while they were fun to hear they could not hold a candle to the wesley concoction after the first few day chris informed u that he wa going to tell u the most amazing story we had ever heard he said it wa a story so amazing that it would take a few night to tell it this story wa of course gamehendge and chris complimented his epic and intricate rendition of the tale with his favorite live version of each song that he had cued up on his maxell 90 it wa during the playing of the lizard that my excitement transitioned from chris’s recount to the music itself the entire cabin wa hooked and any opportunity we had we would mimic the band with our broom and trunk while listening to bootleg while most song saw camper mimicking the various band member including flashlight cks when the lizard wa on we all played the broom nodded our head and tapped our faux foot pedal a we had been told trey did a there wa no youtube we took chris at his word camp every year wa a welcome escape from my awkward socially uncomfortable life thing on the lake made sense but even though i wa landlocked at home i found myself drowning i always sought solace in music but my taste were not in line with most kid of my age when i came back from that summer i wa now a phan and felt that although i wa on the outskirt i wa a part of something i had two close friend who also enjoyed the band and we read everything we could get our hand on i traded tape using aol chat room and snail mail we spent the money we had made doing yard work and washing dish at a local restaurant on cd’s t shirt and bumper sticker so many bumper sticker we were not cool but damn we felt like we were my love of the band grew and grew over the next year so did my feeling of belonging when the fall tour wa announced in 1997 i thoughtfully planned out an extensive rationalization of why i a seventh grader needed to go and when i presented it to my parent to my surprise they said i could go to a show for my birthday my folk were very over protective and still to this day i have no idea what caused them to agree to this i wa even more dumbfounded when they said it would be ok to attend the show the night prior with my best friend his father and his sister whom wa a phish vet and our best source for music and info in the two week leading up to the show we watched the video my friend recoded of the band playing farmhouse on conan ever so gently dubbed over skinamax’s finest a million time i doubt i slept more than three hour a night leading up to november 29th and when the day arrived i wa over the moon i remember my friend’s father parking at the aku aku parking lot and asking his sister what the meaning of the 4 20 bumper sticker wa i could hardly breathe a i walked through huddled mass with extended pointer finger hemp neck adornment patchwork everything and warm greeting for friend both present and future once inside the venue we walked briskly through the crowd and at one point i spied a classmate who wa there with his brother this kid wa much cooler than i and there were few place where our path would cross but this wa one i tapped into my inner clint eastwood and gave the most cool casual head nod i could a if to say i belong here we found seat mid level which were not the one listed on my ticket and a we waited to for the show to start i thought my heart wa going to beat out of my chest a i turned to say something to my friend the light went out and the crowd went nut when the band started playing i wa mesmerized i wish i could say i remembered more detail of the music but the majority of my many memory have been fabricated over the year a i have listened to the show countless time i only knew a handful of the song played that night most notably the sloth from my time at camp and i wa blissfully unaware of the fact that i wa witnessing the longest jam in phish history i do remember trey telling the crowd the buffalo bill wa fishman’s favorite song i returned to the centrum again the following night and traveled down 95 for night one of the island tour my first lizard and kept coming back my core group of friend centered around phish we continued to read every article and book traded tape via snail mail and for the first time in my life i had something to look forward to it wa a place where i fit in a place where i could be myself and say nice thing to nice people without worrying about what the those around me would think while my biological family wa warm and loving i wa a thorn in their side and they couldn’t understand me this other family understood me although i wa only able to take in a handful of show before the fateful friday the 13th when i wa riding the elevator to the 13th floor of a hotel they do exist in albany when the hotel employee said sorry to hear about your boy a she pointed to my phish shirt i couldn’t believe it when she said the newspaper had a big story about the breakup of the band i raced to the room and used the phone to call my friend who confirmed it i had no idea what i would do while the band wa gone the basic roaming area of the family wa within’ reach and a most kid do when their parent are gone i experimented by the time the hampton show were announced i wa in my freshman year of college i had no business being in school and i had begun to spiral a bit i had gone from experimenting to mastering and when the full tour wa announced i picked up and left school for two week which i understood would be the end of my good college try while most people would say this wa a crazy decision please be aware that while i took off to hit a few show did not pas a single class that semester and wa not allowed to reside on campus do to partying with tourmates i wa actually invited back for my sophomore ish year i assume because my lone year of college wa paid in cash after school i started working full time at a residential program for at risk youth where i finally found my calling i loved working with the kid and while my day were filled with hard dedicated work my night and weekend were still spent steeped in excess this culminated in a smattering of show in 2004 leading up to coventry musical highlight from these run are limited a i wa pretty drunk and likely on something s else at this point while i may have been a bit out of control i still felt very close to the community the show were my escape from the stress of life and work while i wa living outside my mental mean while in the community i would have likely done this anywhere coventry hurt aside from a nearly 500 mile walk into the venue which would have made an amazing movie that weekend wa not a good one i left that venue alone in many more way than one and although it took a bit i decided that this would not be how i remembered this band my band my family in the time between what we generally refer to a 2 0 and 3 0 i wa maturing i had found a population of kid who needed me and while i wa charged with teaching and leading them i feel i gained more from them then they could ever take from me even thought the kid were primarily from the inner city and did not connect with the band or family the majority of the thing i wa able to teach them came from my experience with phish i taught them that even if they couldn’t connect to someone in their immediate vicinity reach father if someone ha a problem with you being happy find better friend be you no matter who that is when the band came back in 2009 i wa in a different place altogether had grown in many way i had met who would eventually become my wife i had begun to slow down on night and weekend and wa looking beyond the next show i had begun to replace bad habit with good and instead of drowning my problem i wa facing them when the band announced they were coming back i wa ecstatic the vibe outside fenway wa amazing i saw people i hadn’t seen in year smile were from ear to ear and there wa a new wave of wide eyed younger fan i quickly realized that i wa now a part of the cultural fabric that i wa previously in awe of when the band took the stage mound i got a bit choked up and before long i realized i had been dancing like nothing changed during stash i realized that not only wa the band back but they were a good a they have ever been i have been faithfully attending show ever since and while i may not rage a hard a i used to i am so very appreciative of every single note i went 50 show between my first and second lizard but the second one wa the sweetest i have ever heard in a year that saw me battle crippling anxiety that held me prisoner in my own home for an extended period of time i fought like hell to get back on my foot in time for msg while large crowd and noise were still difficult to deal with i packed into the garden with no issue knowing that when the boy came out i all would be ok when they brought the van out on the floor and started playing classic i knew something special wa happening then i heard the fateful note again tear poured out of my eye tear of joy tear of triumph tear of happiness and love it wa a feeling that i wa pretty sure i would never feel again after the show ended in a euphoric haze i looked at my phone and saw that i had roughly 15 different text from companion all with the same time stamp congratulating me on finally getting my second lizard while i have now been blessed to have been a part of five lizard performance and while i did cry during each of them none will ever match the jemp lizard i did however feel that feeling again in fact i have felt it twice now during and after the birth of my two amazing daughter if i were to tell anyone outside of the community that i could compare the feeling of the birth of my child to a song i heard a band play live i would be met with rolled eye and assumption of consumption but i am fairly certain that many people in this community would understand my job is my identity and while it pay very little it provides me with more wealth than i could spend in ten lifetime over the year i have seen kid die pull weapon on me have the system fail them a million time be abused by their family be abused by the people paid to take care of them be looked over judged by their skin judged by their appearance forgotten exploited and ignored but i have been strong and stood up for them at every turn i have been defeated more than i have been victorious but i have never backed down and i owe much of this to phish and their community for many reason it wa this community that taught me that i am not just good but i am great and i am capable of anything they have taught me that it’s ok to be happy and it’s ok to share that happiness with those around you they have given me the friendship that i rely on for support love and compassion when i am feeling low and on top of this the band ha given me the promise of another show no matter how bleak the situation is if i can just hold on a bit longer i can get to the next show and dance till i am well again so when phish played the jemp lizard i took over 10 year of emotional baggage good bad and ugly and cast it into the rafter tear flowed throughout the song and my smile had never been bigger it all made sense finally i had read all of the chapter but finally understood the true message of the book you know the one this feeling wa so pure happy and freeing and i only wish that everyone wa entitled to feel this way at least once in their life i have been blessed to feel this way three time now and while i may have peaked i am so happy my two year old enjoyed her first show from the amazing family section in the grass during the last spac run and i can’t wait until my one month old is ready for her first show keep playing spac it’s the only venue i’d take a kid to while my girl may not love phish a much a i do a they get older i hope they are able to love something the way i love phish whether it be a band a hobby a location movie or a cause so i guess what i am trying to say is thank you thank you for being who you are thank you for always striving to be better thank you for being there for me thank you for providing me with the space to discover who i am and the confidence to walk off the lot and into the real world a that person thank you for the jam the ballad the silly and the serious thank you for the festival and not to be missed sunday show thank you for the outlet thank you for the community the love and most of all thank you for the music still upside down ob

1,possible ticket for sale for trey acoustic on 2 10 in cambridge ma orchestra section g i jumped the day of the pre sale after reading on this sub that all the ticket sold out in 3 min i can t make nye this year which would cost quite a bit to sit where i like arrange for accommodation so i paid the stub hub price gouge evil price of 535 50 for 1 ticket in section g of the orchestra section best closest section i believe it s only a 1000 person venue anyway i saw trey at carnegie hall for my 13th birthday in 2009 with my mother who had never seen him it wa a fond memory that we both remember and she loved the experience my parent know i paid a bunch for this febuary ticket and my mom inquired about going but even though we live comfortably wouldn t spent 500 dollar on herself for pretty much anything however my dad offered for me to sell the ticket i bought and purchase two more ticket in the same section a a christmas gift for her one of his friend ha two for sale through a work connection if someone on here is interested then i would pull the trigger and hopefully have another amazing experience with my mother who put herself before everyone else at any cost almost 9 year later time fly i still feel like i m 13 that wa a bit too cliché sappy and wordy but that s the story if someone s interested comment or pm me and i won t charge you a dime more than i paid shipping
1,the jam band sterotype i wa explaining phish to a friend earlier today and they were asking what type of music it wa and i wa explaining if you want to dumb it down to it most basic then they are jam band and he say oh so one of those band that play the same song for 2 hour i ve heard this a lot but i ve never really thought about it people like to joke about how jam band will play the same song for 30 minute to an hour and that s the main point that they like to complain about but little do they know if phish played the same song for an hour we wouldn t stop talking about it for a long time the very thing they complain about is what we live for just a little bit of irony i wa mulling over today i ve also realized that most people are under the impression that they assume that it s just the same verse chorus verse chorus verse chorus over and over again for however long i ve had somebody ask me why would you want to hear the same song so many different way to which i replied why would you want to hear the same song the same way so many time ramble over

1,trey anastasio 2002 i loved this album when it came out 15 year ago i listened to it today for the first time in year here s my review mixing latin rhythm jazzy groove funk workout and bluesy rock riff trey brings together almost all of the element phish had touched on in their nearly 20 year on the road by this time he doesn’t really touch bluegrass or country but he doe look toward what would become his own infatuation with classical arrangement he would eventually release a fully orchestral album and play a handful of live performance with symphony over the next decade and a half and although the genre mixing and matching sometimes resembles phish the songwriting seems to be a bit more mature nuanced and all around le goofy for good and for bad trey sings earnestly throughout often backed by jennifer hartswick not many tongue in cheek lyric here and nothing too nonsensical there are plenty of solo and extended instrumental section but for the most part the band fully commits to laying down a rhythm setting the stage for trey to be the lone improviser though the bass line are often simple and repetitive the drumming and percussion are effective in keeping the groove moving the funky organ playing and boisterous horn section provide an excellent counter point to trey’s often wild guitar line what do you think trey anastasio
1,jason isbell phish reference the ryman just got home from the show jason said this i have a friend that follows phish and you learn there is a difference between following phish and following phish he also say that if they don t play a song for a long time and then play it then that s a bust out so that last song we played wa a bustout he say there is this thing where they play a note it s like more than peaking or playing the best note it called the hose also john prine came out and played with him and they teased no quarter

1,to be fair you have to have a very high iq to appreciate phish the music is extremely eclectic and without a solid grasp of genre most of the musical cue will go over a typical listener s head there s also trey’s extensive music background which is deftly woven into his guitar playing his oeuvre draw heavily from jazz and bluegrass for instance the fan understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of this music to realize that they re not just 20 minute song about marsupial they say something deep about life a a consequence people who dislike phish truly are idiot of course they wouldn t appreciate for instance the humour hayley’s comet’s lyric i love meatball so you better be ready which itself is a cryptic reference to dante’s divine comedy i m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpleton scratching their head in confusion a trey anastasio s genius unfolds itself in their ear what fool how i pity them and yes by the way i do have a phish tattoo and no you cannot see it it s for the lady eye only and even they have to demonstrate that they re within 5 iq point of my own preferably lower beforehand

1,weird stat request puzzle i ve been trying to think about how to even figure this question out conceptually and i m not sure and haven t seen it over on stat area hopefully one of you heady logician c head can shed some light on this premise there s no way to guarantee that you see a certain song at any given show but past performance are the best indicator of future likeli hood performance question so based on past show excluding halloween cover show what is the shortest playlist you could make that would guarantee that any past show randomly selected would be guaranteed to have at least 1 song from your playlist i figure this get a close a possible to approximating a playlist that you could give to someone prior to taking them to a show that would guarantee that they hear at least 1 song they ve heard before other than brute forcing it by starting with a set of the most commonly played and somehow running the check and then eliminating one at a time i m not sure how you would figure it out thought idea solution

1,song that define each year i wa just thinking about what individual song would define each year of phish it could be that the song got played a lot in a particular year that the song got jammed a lot in a particular year or even that the song debuted in a particular year the only one i can think of right now is 1995 which to me wa defined by free the song certainly got played a decent amount in 95 but it also usually included trey on his percussion set which also stand out to me a a memorable part of 95 though usually not in a good way i might say that down with disease defined 1994 since it basically debuted in 94 and wa played quite a bit that year there were also some stand out version in 94 ghost might be 1997 i m struggling to come up the other year

1,esther retold hello all i m currently writing a short story for a literary magazine near me the topic a i m sure you have already figured out is a more fleshed out story of esther esther is one of my favorite song and really solidified my interest in phish before i had much more exposure if any of you have the time i would like some input on the quality and and if it follows close enough to the original story for die hard fan to appreciate if you think something is wrong or maybe you just have some advice on really capturing the feel i would appreciate the advice i ve taken a few creative liberty to make the story flow better and put emphasis on the thing i find important to the story the piece is tentatively called murk on the curb in the north western part of vermont along the eastern shore of lake champlain wa the quiet town of burlington a seemingly perfect place to settle down and live your life the majority of inhabitant were quite friendly with each other always stopping to say hello or how is your mother certainly no one from the outside would be able to see the sulking shadow hanging over the town and it’s people one such citizen wa a little girl by the name of esther esther wa 10 year old she enjoyed going to school playing with her friend and most of all playing with doll you see although most of the town wa relatively well off esther’s family wa not her father had left before she wa born too afraid of the responsibility that come with parenthood the situation never improved a esther’s mother periodically fell in and out of bout of alcoholism every birthday esther begged her mother for a pretty doll but wa always left disappointed just down the road from esther’s home were the fairground every year during october they held a large fair although playing with doll wa esther’s favorite thing to do the fair wa a close second unfortunately she never had money to go she wa content with standing on the outside observing the light and sound from a distance someday i’m going to save up my money and go to the fair whispered esther to herself a she finished her sentence esther noticed a man clad in black robe a black so black it seemed to pull in the light and sound of the fair nearby and twisted them into a sort of otherworldly glow around him what’s that light thought esther a the man ducked into a hole in the fence surrounding the fairground what is he up to esther crept up to the spot where she saw the man disappear moment earlier a she got closer the thought of the man in black seemed to fade into the back of her mind she had an opportunity to make one of her dream come true now not later at this very moment elated esther crawled through that same hole which the strange man entered a soon a she exited the hole esther’s whole world wa turned upside down she could hear the music better than ever instead of light spinning around she saw the ferris wheel for what it truly wa she saw people smiling and laughing she saw people interact with one another greeting each other much the same a they would on the street always formal and polite but never getting too close this didn’t bother esther she wa used to the personal space afforded to each member of the community they just liked their space it wa normal and besides esther wa in heaven the sight and sound of the fair were overwhelming drowning out all other thought’s in the little girl’s mind not long though the smell of fried dough corn dog and all thing delicious made her painfully aware of the rumbling in her stomach she hadn’t eaten since the night before she had some spare change but 37 cent were just not going to cut it she headed towards the trash can surely someone must have discarded a treat for her to find digging through the garbage esther’s found what she wa looking for a half eaten piece of fried dough and a small tuft of cotton with barely any spit on it she happily plucked them from the bin and began to eat little girl she heard coming from behind her suddenly ashamed of what she wa doing she dropped the snack to the ground and turned to face the punishment she wa sure to receive when she turned she found the man with robe darker than the absence of light standing behind her from here she got a much better look at the man he looked quite unusual compared to the rest of the town i’m sorry mister i didn’t mean any harm i’m just so hungry pleaded esther the man seeming to understand her situation produced a fresh piece of fried dough and a large wad of cotton candy esther smiled politely a she had seen the townsfolk do many time and thanked the man a he approached esther took note of his strange feature his skin had a yellowish hue not exactly like someone who wa ill but more like someone who had recently passed and wa on display at a funeral home the yellowish flesh seemed to hang off of his face like a mask but it wa certainly attached she could see fluid leaking from his left ear running down his face with his long grey hair stuck to it and the smell oh god the smell he smelled of rotting fish and peppermint in his hand she spied a bucket that she wa sure must contain fish after all he did look a bit like a fisherman from out of town he said little girl you can chop off my leg and then peel off my sock if you want to a sly grin stretched across his face nearly ear to ear this wa not like the smile she had offered him earlier instead he had a double set of teeth that took on the appearance of a saw each of his front teeth were offset from the second row of teeth most were topped with a little point a few of them filed down or broken the man threw his head back in laughter when he saw the scared look on her face she could see his eye now there wa a mischievous glint to them from the light and ride around them she couldn’t explain why but it made her uncomfortable but the word seemed to drag out for day a esther stood in terror i’d rather you take this old puppet from me that i hold in my pail a we speak forgetting the danger at hand esther ran up to the man a fast a her malnourished leg could carry her the man tilted the bucket toward her she saw the black button eye of the doll and knew she couldn’t resist thanks in advance for any and all input edit funky formatting

1,show discussion thread april 4 1998 providence civic center providence ri you can find previous entry in this series thanks to the enthusiastic to u jeffray123 s post i figured it might be time to try bringing this series back thinking that making it a weekly feature instead of three show a week dear god what wa i thinking will increase interest and avoid burning myself out i ll be including streaming link so you can hear the show yourself a well a the above spreadsheet where you can see all 128 previous entry in this series please leave a comment if you have thought or suggestion for the continued success of historical show discussion the third of four island tour show shift venue to the providence civic center a few hour north of long island those of u who made the trek from last night s show are rewarded with a tweezer that follows the tweeprise closer from the previous night and this one is a top shelf opener a portent of thing to come for the rest of the night the taste that it lead into is no slouch either high powered and characteristically full of tension release limb by limb feature a pretty tight for the era solo from trey and a typically high energy zero close set one the second set is significantly better although imo falling just short of the epicness from providence ii the second rendition of boaf go nearly twice a long a the first and while the band might not have enough of a well defined template to begin experimenting and breaking away from it you can hear plenty of suggestion here for how to do that in later rendition after fizzing out a bit fishman pick up the 2001 beat and the funk bridge from 1997 is in full effect here 16 minute and unfinished they go into a bit of a vocal percussion jam instead of the reprise of the theme which connects via trey s delay loop into brother a you ve never heard it before i ll let the setlist note from set the stage for this one you can find them with the setlist detail at the bottom of this post the ghost that follows is probably underrated now not being on the jam chart but it s still one of my favorite and not just because i m a big blue brother fan the cherry on top is a throwback ending with bowie to close the set and a hood encore at this point the island tour is right up there with hampton winston salem and virginia beach walnut creek lakewood a the best threepeat of show since the madness of july 1993 streaming link aud aud download link aud sbd mp3 10 lossless 13 setlist info from set 1 tweezer taste bouncing around the room funky bitch ginseng sullivan limb by limb lawn boy character zero set 2 bird of a feather 2001 brother ghost the lizard david bowie encore harry hood some wonderful space funk evolves into stellar full band magnificent improv mike is really rock solid here underpinning the harmonic base off of which trey and page shine still this version doesn t have quite the extra mustard of many 97 version elongated and groovy version suggests several possible future jamming direction while never straying too far from bird itself haunting intro and a grooving minimalist first jam trey pounce at the 9 minute mark and another island tour masterpiece is created about 4 38 into the conventional brother this one departs into a great funky jam way beyond the standard it nonetheless build in tension and dissonance a the jam progress includes a brief deg tease after the song the band played a brief radio friendly reprise trey jokingly remark this is also not radio friendly because it is long and slow includes can t turn you loose tease blue brother theme next week the island tour concludes with another new song from the sotg recording session

1,vega golden age one year later video a year ago tomorrow i experienced the phish show that changed my life forever it wasn t the best show i ve ever been to but it literally changed my life in a way no other concert ever ha and this is even with the jam filled recency bias if only video existed of the vega golden they seemed to be pulling every link that wa put up from anything the entire halloween run which ha me hoping against hope for a dvd box set well it sure would be cool if someone had gotten ahold of the for those of you running a little slow on a friday there are two hyperlink in this paragraph give one of them a try listen to 14 43 and 21 32 if nothing else to experience the two high flying peak let me set the scene 10 28 2016 wa the first night of a 4 night run in vega for halloween and happens to be a friday this meant halloween wa on a monday so a lot of people saved the pto and flew in friday after work or saturday morning and missed the friday show no big deal right unused ticket were literally all over the floor outside the entrance to the venue i still wonder if any mgm patron picked up a free ticket and caught the show for free the first set wa incredible imo with a solid song selection is it possible to have a sub par set when mm nminml open the set and cavern wotc close it the answer is no crime of the mind opened the second set but what we re here to talk about is the second song in the second set the highest peak phish ha hit in 3 0 the vega golden age play by play 0 00 cover song a tight version but nothing to write home about compared to other performance 4 15 the usual trey solo out of the last chorus 7 05 abruptly drop into a type ii jam you start to get the impression that this could be different the jam is a bit dissonant at first a the band find it footing and they quickly move into a tight groove page carry melody but mike jon are the mvp s of this beginning section 9 13 trey take over lead mike turn on this filthy distortion effect 10 02 classic page mike groove with jon playing snare hi hat exclusively 11 24 trey take lead while he sustains note page mike fill in gap 13 04 same basic melody just more from every band member 13 44 trey page begin melody that will continue through peak 14 43 you can feel the peak coming calm before the madness 15 22 pay attention to page s part here these few bar are what he repeat to drive this peak 15 27 trey lock in he s the focal point of the blissful peak here but page hold it together great interplay between the two build w sustain from trey until wild peak 17 11 18 19 18 31 i turn to the guy next to me and say wow that wa unexpected i figured we were ready to move on mike keep the energy going 19 45 page lead trey tease something between sand and take five 21 05 trey take lead back from page increase in tempo and energy 21 32 wait there s no way this jam hit a second peak 22 24 you can tell what s on the way the entire band is so tight and focused 23 16 band lock in for peak 24 07 amazing blissful peak 2 start in and keep getting more high energy and intense a only phish jam can very different from the first peak 24 59 just when you think it couldn t be pushed further 25 33 peak end and drop directly into simple riff crowd exhales collectively we truly are living in a golden age an age of miracle and sound see you all in december

1,favorite underrated jam i am aware that these thread happen a lot but i have three jam on my mind that i want to put down really quick 10 22 16 it kill me that this jam is not even a recommended jam on because trey really brings the heat straight 94 tension and release on this bad boy i don t know if i just have an emotional connection to it because this wa my first and only show but this is something special to me i had never partaken in a glowstick war and this had been a dream of mine once i saw footage of the magna and right when this song started someone gave me a handful of glowsticks and said get ready kid i wa 16 at the time i wa heavily anticipating the peak but trey would tease a peak then pull it back just edging u for the musical orgasm that wa the finale 11 22 94 funky this one is far le underrated however i think it should go down a one of phish s greatest jam and i barely hear people talking about it gordo brings the heat to the vocal part almost to the extent that i thought they brought in a guest singer if you think the magic end there though the jam go all over the place that classic 94 tension some ambiance phish burning the motherfucker down dissonance then a segue into yerushalayim shel zahav continuing the darkness of this beautiful jam if you haven t heard this monster give it a shot 6 18 94 you enjoy phish s best yem prove me wrong there is one moment in particular that set this jam apart for me and that s when trey doe this deal where he layer on effect giving the feeling of the room being covered in ice crystal then hit this hammer on melting the frost he just laid over uic pavilion i don t know how else to put it but it s one of those thing that make you wonder how a human can come up with this off the top of their head absolutely beautiful and multi faced yem that is my favorite track off of the chicago 94 box set what jam have left a long term impact on you that you never hear being talked about

1,jambase interview with mike hopefully this lay those silly hiatus rumor to rest jambase on that note after putting out big boat and playing the baker’s dozen which by all gauge seems to be a massive success and no fall tour for phish it feel like the end of a cycle other band will put out an album tour on it and then go off the road for a bit doe it feel like the end of a cycle for you for phish or the start of a new one mg well phish run itself so well and i don’t mean without people because there are people but a lot of time i just don’t have to think about it all year and last year i’ve been working on my album a the main thing long before the baker’s dozen it’s kinda like there are other people to make decision i bring some song to phish and i bring myself and my soul from day to day even if i’m on the road with phish i might be doing a little bit of plotting and scheming for my own project i don’t think of it one way or the other i appreciate having this extra time to really get out there and like you said do a slightly longer tour with my band and follow through with album stuff i’m really thankful that i have my time jambase ha phish learned from the past in term of the hiatus and the breakup where you’ll play when you feel like playing instead of needing to have defined huge break mg yeah i don’t think it ha to be defined a a breakup or hiatus i mean maybe there would be a hiatus but i think we’ve kind of figured out it give u the enjoyment and the musical challenge that we need if we let it breathe and don’t try to overdo it it’s just a matter of allowing it some breathing space so it can come back and be rejuvenated i mean we can do more and we can do le and it would be fine either way but just kind of monitoring it like ok let’s take a break and that work fine

1,unpopular opinion i don t particularly care for the jam filled show from bd i wa there i went to red velvet sunday 7 23 jam filled tuesday 7 25 powdered wednesday 7 26 don t get me wrong i wa at a great phish show and loved it a always but even out of those three show it wa my least favorite there are two main reason this show left me salty 1 the nearby crowd the entire row behind me wa nothing but drunk stoned chompers nonstop loud talking and spilling beer my wife and i left our decent seat for the 300s during my friend my friend the newfound space wa a relief and the sound wa still ok but even up there we encountered a group of cocaine clown who were oblivious to other people s space these gripe are not inherently tied to the band or this particular performance but environment is crucial and unfortunately this environment wa validating for people who dis the band because of the scene 2 more importantly but of course still subjective length of a jam doe not automatically mean the jam is epic sure it wa really fun when we all realized that sample wa taking off and lawn boy of course sure duh so much fun but personally i d rather have a seven minute jam with hose and direction than 30 minute of jamming for jamming s sake rant over just my opinion a a middle aged fan overall i think bd will go down a one of the most awesome feat in the band s history top 5 highlight from the show i wa lucky to see it s ice crosseyed and painless tube having listened to all of bd this might be 1 for me overall mr completely 1999 take care of your shoe y all

1,i like phish lol just wanted to share how i came to be a phish fan i thought it wa kind of funny my friend of 25 year is a giant phish fan and ha been for a long a i can remember i have made fun of him constantly for it relentlessly mercilessly a few month before bd he posted something on facebook looking for people who would be down to sneak package of tortilla into msg to start a tortilla war a folk did in boise in 99 i never see this dude since we don t live close to each other and he s a very good friend so i said i wa down i spent a the month between then and bd listening up learning their stuff listening and watching a ton of live stuff and ended up liking most of what i heard we went on night 6 we scratched the tortilla idea but when divided sky came on i wa completely sold it wa a religious experience for me i d consider myself obsessed at this point and am counting down the day until their nye run i live in the nyc area i am very fortunate my only fear is that they re going to break up at some point i know they have before sooner than everyone would imagine which will leave me having missed so many amazing show i guess what i mean is i wish i opened my ear sooner i m really picky with music and phish is truly therapeutic to me every song ha it own personality and character so weird i wa the biggest hater lol

1,thought on nashville first of all one of the coolest musical experience i ve had many thanks to all the cool phans i met there and to trey and the symphony for making it happen i had moderate expectation going in that were totally blown away just by the end of the first set some thought ck5 really mailed it in on this one huh never thought i d see so many donut tie in one place a refresher course on etiquette would have been helpful for everyone s listening experience obviously it s a different crowd than your standard orchestral arrangement but you have a large group of professional musician up there who are trying to stay precisely in time without the help of in ear monitor and having the audience shouting an wooing throughout the performance is a major drag trey addressed this somewhat tongue in cheek after divided sky saying for those of you who don t know that last tune one of those time when everyone wa yelling is kind of part of the song so good job everyone i don t know what pedal or lack thereof trey wa using to get some of his tone during first tube and what s the use but i ve never heard them come out of the languedoc before the one appropriate moment of crowd noise stash clap and they ve never been more on point time turn elastic should only be played with an orchestra the downtempo turn at the end of yem wa a welcome surprise though crowd noise again wa an issue i kept waiting for a 58 person rotation jam that just never seemed to materialize

1,18 year of seeing phish a brief reflection i never would have thought i would be seeing this band 18 year after my first show at the pyramid in memphis tn i wa 15 impressionable and a little off kilter for my age i felt like i wa a little on the fringe of the social group at my school i wa fun and funny but a little too goofy to be cool and a little too ambitious to be comfortable being a loser that wa my first time eating mushroom and it wa a memorable time i remember watching a group of people throwing orange glowsticks during the 2001 and i wa convinced someone wa throwing flaming torch saw them a few more time and once i wa allowed and able to make it on tour all decision i made in my life were to support my addiction to the band from 2003 2004 i saw the majority of my show at the time doing two and three week run at a time i got job and quit job just to support the the party it wa fun i found my tribe and i felt like myself more than i ever had in my life we all know the feeling when the scene started to turn a little darker when trey wa getting down too hard and show began to suffer greatly i began feeling a little out of place again after waiting 40 hour in traffic for coventry and getting in to the abortion that wa that event i washed my hand of the band whether or not they came back i wa not going to be part of it all the subsequent event afterwards just sullied my image of what i thought wa important to me i started to question whether i wa just fucked up the whole time and whether or not the whole thing wa a fueled sham i felt a little bit taken i thought back to the show i loved where they were hitting on all cylinder and i wa unsure whether they held the importance i put on them i gave away my collection and i stopped caring all together about the band they came back in 2009 and i went just because it wa in my hometown it wa fine i just realized i had lost the zeal i thought maybe i could get it back but it wa gone i saw a couple more show here and there a show a year just to catch up with old friend always leaving the show a if i had just hung out with an old girlfriend i didn t much like anymore i found the love of my life and often time would reminisce on some of the time on tour while it wa very short it wa during my formative year i always wished i could have shared that moment with my now wife but i knew it would never happen again fast forward to 2015 and i get talked into going to magnaball i noticed that a lot of the people at the show had gotten older their kid were there i ran into a few old friend ran into mike and chatted with him had a great experience with my wife and could feel it bubbling up again she could tell it meant a lot to me this wa the first time she could actually see it after the tweezer caspian something burned in my heart it wa back full throttle i remembered all the great show and i remembered they were transcendent there wa no sham there were good time and bad it wasn t all just a party that ended too soon it wa something special something just a special a i remembered it i wa sure i d never take my wife on the road to multiple show to where she could actually experience those event that happen when you follow a band around well since 2015 we ve traveled the country a much a we could 25 odd show after magnaball and we are both hooked me again and her for the first time and i got it back there wa something that wa missing for a long time and i got it back and the band gave it back to me while i saw some great weird dark show i am happier seeing them now than i have ever been and take each show with gratitude because they could have been done a long time ago so that s all thanks gang 18 year ago hemp and all 18 later

1,i just listened to 2 0 in it entirety let s talk about it i had listened to a number of these show previously but i finally decided to listen to every 2 0 show in order overall my feeling towards it are a follows lot of diamond in the rough setlist creativity wa seriously lacking 1st set were often much better than 2nds my personal favorite moment were 2 14 03 gin wotc 2 20 03 pebble 2 22 03 wotc 2 24 03 entire 1st set 2 28 03 entire show duh 7 13 03 seven below 7 15 03 mr completely fest 7 22 03 entire 2nd set all of it 12 28 03 frankie say brooklyn all of spac 04 hampton 04 entire 1st set best wotc ever imo and then there s coventry honestly i don t find it that terrible to listen to the 1st set on day 1 wa actually great drowned split open and melt are both top notch jam won t necessarily be reaching for these 2 show regularly but the highlight are pretty strong nonetheless so what do you guy all think of this era it s probably still my least favorite of them all but i certainly have a newfound respect for some of it finer moment
1,my reflection on my 25 year of seeing phish inspired by u brockatwork so here s my story if you care to read my sister is 7 year older than me she had a boyfriend who moved to nc from ny in 1990 and they hit it off when i wa hanging out with them he would talk about this band phish because he knew i wa into the grateful dead after a few month he produced a tape of one set of music and i wa laughing at him i thought it sucked compared to gd i can t for the life of me remember which show it wa from however i wa intrigued and interested in hearing more at that time i wa all about the dead no one could top them or even come close little did i know slowly more tape began to arrive and i became hooked i saw my first 2 show in 92 the band wa fun and raw we thought that these guy were awesome musician and hilarious at the same time never at first did we take them a a serious band that would become something big never did we think this small vermont band would become anything more than what they were an awesome bar band that jammed and were funny over the course of the next few year i saw more and more show i loved it ticket were cheap the crowd wa small the show weren t crawling with police and we began to think we were getting in on the ground level of something that no one else knew about still we had no idea of just how big it would become skip ahead many year and me and my friend went on tour jerry had passed and the scene started changing dramatically not for better or worse just changing so many more people at show now it wa sort of strange it had up until to this point been a fairly small community you hear the word family a lot these day it doesn t mean what it used to in the mid 90 s we were all family at phish show no one wa a stranger no one caused issue or violence no one wa judgemental we took care of stranger like they were best friend this ha changed now sincere touring continues myself and 3 friend did the entire 96 97 and 98 tour every show fall spring and winter minus europe we saw it all this is in my opinion the absolute peak for the band we all had job but but quit working when tour started we only had ticket for a few show each tour but never failed to make it in after each show we would scour the lawn if summer or the floor if winter and collect everything that wa dropped we had nowhere to be and most folk were scurrying to get home so we stayed finding stuff until they made u leave if you haven t done it before you would be amazed at what people drop and leave at a show this included at that time ton of pot gel tab and paper hit after that we would sell what we had found to finance the next few show we would use that money to buy soda and beer to sell in the lot and for you young folk it s in lot not on lot we wanted to get rid of the drug we weren t keeping and taking asap so we couldn t be busted for what we were selling this wa tour in the mid to late 90 s no biggie no planning just run with it we made it into every show including the west valley utah dsotm show where it felt it like a club show again so few people no one checking ticket to ensure you weren t on the floor with upper we picked up a couple of phish tour hitch hiker after this show and they were absolutely terrible another story skip ahead another few year and big cypress is coming up me and my crew minus one rip jb made the trip we had already attended the clifford ball great went lemonwheel and oswego however we were not prepared for the majesty that wa to come big cypress wa unlike any other festival the band had put on sure lot of people but this one wa different ton of people were there we were all jokingly but not sure worried about the y2k thing and thought nowhere is safer to be that night than in the middle of nowhere in the everglade swamp traffic getting in wa brutal getting out another story the strangest thing about big cypress wa the lack of drug everyone wa so petrified of carrying anything down i 95 due to the hype of the show that people were struggling to find anything if they didn t bring a small amount for themselves we settled into our camping spot and made our way to the concert field everything and everyone wa electric listened to soundcheck could only imagine what we were in store for we were luckily enough able to attend the last 8 show of 99 winter tour the boy were on fire but it didn t matter if they completely dropped the ball one night we knew big cypress wa coming big cypress wa incredible everything i could have hoped for many people were pissed about the hotdog float schtick again but i loved it it cruised right past u anyway first set at big cypress we were late to the concert field we did the dick move of fighting our way through 80k folk to find a spot near the front we sat down and awaited the show i m from north carolina and the group we sat down behind wa from indiana one of the lady in that group is now my wife been married for 12 year crazy met her at big cypress out of all those people who would have thought 2 kid now and a in love a the day we met thanks phish rambling trying to move on so my then gf but now wife and i saw a many show a we could through the next few year being that she s from indiana we had a great place to stay with her parent during that epic 3 night summer run at deer creek in 2000 we saw a many show a we could until the dreadful hiatus once that wa over and they announced their return we had everyone we knew submit ticket request for the msg and hampton show luckily we were able to get ticket to all 4 show wa a god send we were so fucking pumped to be in the garden that night witnessing history but after the whole run we were saddened and troubled by what we heard i expected the boy to come back full steam they didn t this began the era of trey s slipping and bad performance yikes this is getting way too long down vote if you feel the need after this we saw a many show a we could afford to we even saw 4 show the first year of our first child s birth after that it s been show when we could find a sitter and so forth now at 42 it s strange to go to show the band is back and are playing this year amazingly the crowd today is very different though which is to be expected it s just to me the crowd is very different fight in the lot nitrous etc anyway i have totally forgotten what the person who inspired me to post this said these are just my thought from an old vet trying to relate i hope you enjoyed reading it

1,best live round room’ album track phish ha been my favorite thing since i started playing music when i wa 10 17 year ago since then i’ve caught a dozen of their show and have logged many listening hour to the live show the first studio album that made me fall in love with them wa round room the first time i heard it wa like a storm door swung open in my heart especially a a studio effort i think the boy did an exceptional job of translating their live experience to a private’ setting i believe the reverse is true a well these song translate so well live i have never heard a seven below’ or wall of the cave’ that didn’t end up being a highlight of the particular set they were placed in that being said i feel like some of the other track from round room are gloriously underplayed i’m wondering perhaps if y’all can point out some of your favorite instance where track from round room got the proper live treatment

1,phish recommended song hey everybody i hope people will take the time to read a boring old text post amidst all the other great content in this subreddit for anyone who is active in the grateful dead community you may or may not recognize me a the creator of the grateful grabber chrome extension for the live music archive that project ha been a great success with almost 4 000 weekly user it make me so happy to see that number rise and so it inspired me to create some software for the phish community a i love phish so very dearly i am currently a senior in undergrad and i wa already planning on creating a crossplatform desktop app to stream all the phish show from phish in i figured i d kill two bird with one stone and use this a my senior capstone project which my professor seemed to like the idea of although he recommended that i implement some algorithmic complexity to the app which lead me to the main purpose of this app a recommendation system that suggests song or show based on your current preference most listened to track and most liked track by the community i m sure many of you already use the site although i am not sure how many of you actually have an account for the site and methodically click the little heart button next to show or track this is an extremely important feature in my project and so i wa hoping to raise a bit of awareness to get a bit more involved in the liking process through phish in a quick overview of how i will be implementing a recommendation system algorithm is a follows we will run an audio analysis tool for every single track in the phish in repository by classifying certain attribute of the raw audio file such a bpm tempo the pitch frequency and many more we will be able to cluster group of song together based on how similar they sound a simple example of this would be that most of the bluegrassy tune old home place blue and lonesome etc would end up in cluster a whereas the more funky tune moma bek think fall 97 incarnate would end up in cluster b this is extremely simplified but after implementing the algorithm i am hoping that we can get into the nitty gritty of the jam and start clustering jam together i don t have any solid example of this off the top of my head but think a carini jam that really go somewhere and then a dwd jam that happens to sound similar to that carini jam ultimately that will be the base of our clustering algorithm and the liked track how many time all user have listened to a song how many time you a the user have listened to that track will weigh into how we choose a song to recommend from that cluster of track overall i guess after writing all of this there is no real concrete point to this post other than to gauge the interest of the community on if this kind of recommendation tool might be interesting or not additionally to see how many user may find it cool to have a standalone desktop app on both pc and mac to pop open and stream their favorite show from hope to get some meaningful feedback down in the comment and feel free to ask any question give some suggestion if you feel like you have a good idea one example of a suggestion i personally have for myself is maybe running a text analysis tool on the comment from to classify how an overall show may feel to the user eg this show wa packed with funk thus those song will be weighted towards the funk group additionally i don t have much of a musical background and i know there are a bunch of savant out there u wforwumbo and u thegreatjatsby who may have some advice on what and how to specify certain piece of audio that i may not be aware of done rambling i hope you all have a great day

1,fun story for dog lover and phish geek bd content a little over a month ago my girlfriend and i decided that we wanted to get a dog i ve always been a dog person and grew up with them but most of my adult life i lived in apartment and did a lot of moving for work so it just wasn t in the card my girlfriend ha always been a cat person and ha never had one before so she wa a bit more tentative at first but now we have a house with a great fenced in backyard and she wa actually the one to suggest why don t we just do it what better time than now this made me just about a happy a i could be she still talk about the face i made when she suggested we get one so the hunt for a dog wa officially on we already had big plan to do the last 5 night of the baker s dozen so we knew we couldn t get one until after we were back but by this point we were both so excited we couldn t help ourselves to start the search i m very partial to labrador retriever a that s what my family always had growing up and i think they make such sweet house pet but the more we got into searching the more set my girlfriend got on getting a golden retriever they are beautiful dog and have temperament very similar to a lab so i really had no issue with this we started doing some emailing and eventually found an available female golden retriever puppy we took off to go visit her a soon a we could and immediately fell in love she wa perfect the only problem wa she wa going to be ready to go home in a couple week but we wouldn t be able to get her until later than that after baker s dozen wa over fortunately the owner didn t mind keeping her for a little while longer until we were back from our phishcation i think we actually said we were spending a week in nyc with friend and seeing some show so still true so that wa officially settled we had our puppy next wa deciding on a name there were a handful of different name we both liked some more than others at first i wasn t real big on the idea of doing a phish related name but i also wasn t opposed to it eventually we did get it down to between piper and izabella she would go by izzy after all the only reason the two of u even met in the first place is because of phish we met on okcupid after i saw her very compatible profile that also talked a lot about seeing phish our first date wa actually in vega before the 2014 halloween show somewhere along the line we did start leaning towards piper but for whatever reason i just couldn t rule out izabella so i came up with the idea that if phish busted out izabella in the last 5 show of the bd that would be her name otherwise it d be piper obviously this wa extremely unlikely to happen and we prepared for our new dog that would be called piper but a you are reading this now you already know how this story end we were planning on picking up the puppy the day after the bd wa over on the way home from the run so we had to do all of our homework and shopping before leaving for the run to make sure we were ready i even got this sweet dog tag made to go along with her new collar and leash we watched most of the webcasts of the first 8 night and were selfishly hoping that they d manage to save piper for the last 5 so when the red velvet show wa announced it seemed like that would not happen a piper felt like a given to fit the theme not that it would be that big of a deal we ve both seen the song live plenty of time but a the twist and turn of this run went it never showed up making u feel better about our odds now the real interesting donut in regard to this story wa night 8 the last show before we headed to the garden jimmy they still hadn t played piper yet at this point and it actually seemed to put the nail in the coffin on any hope they d bustout izabella at our show if there wa ever a night where an izabella bustout wa somewhat likely this wa it if they didn t play it that night which they didn t great show though then they probably never would again now it wa our turn to experience this legendary phish run what would be a cool way to celebrate our new golden retriever puppy named piper how about the 2nd set of our first show opening with golden age and then getting our sought after piper in that very same set pretty damn cool and had u stoked a hell so that wa it it wa all but almost settled rage these last four night of incredible phish and then we d go get our own piper a couple time we did say well what if haha yeah right never happening and really by the last day i don t think we even mentioned izabella once it wa far out of our radar at this point and we were just anticipating how phish could possibly end this historical run and were excited to pick up our golden piper after it wa over in an epic personal stat fashion for me they opened the show with dog stole thing my first time ever seeing it live 124 show pretty damn cool but everyone know what else went down that final first set when trey went into the riff i wa in complete denial that this wa actually happening no fucking way my girlfriend and i just looked at each other with our jaw on the floor and with that just a mere 18 hour before picking her up phish had changed the name of our new dog meet izabella madison izzy come i think we might already be best i did save our old piper dog tag just placed it in my shoebox of ticket stub and other concert memory and if tl dr at least everyone can enjoy a couple cute puppy pic

1,baker s dozen sbd mp3 s
1,my take on the baker s dozen ranked by merit and discussion on each show ranking the baker’s dozen is an inevitable in the fan base i’ve seen many what are your favorite show or what is your favorite jam post but having been at all 13 show i wanted to offer some highly subjective and opinionated perspective on all 13 night i’ve included some commentary to demonstrate my reasoning behind my ranking a well a general note and commentary on the show also please note these are my personal subjective opinion you are welcome to disagree with me and please share your thought in the comment i actually welcome the discussion of conflicting opinion and will upvote per reddiquette accordingly a quick note to fully inform you of where my opinion come from there are lot of bustouts this run and lot of them are really cool but when i wa at the run i found myself more often than naught thinking hmm yup i wa there the last x time they played this and that doesn’t devalue the bustout nor how it wa performed but it doe subjectively influence my opinion of the show that’s not to say i didn’t get excited at bustouts and it’s not to say that i didn’t love getting some tune for the first time i’ll try to identify these moment in my note if i speak negatively about a bustout and try to dissociate my lack of enthusiasm from something you may have thought wa amazing or a blessing to witness again keep in mind these are just my opinion and i am in no way asking you to accept these a hard fact i can’t stress this enough i just want to start a dialogue and discussion a well a offer my perspective of the run especially since i imagine not many got to witness all 13 i noticed an odd pattern in the run starting night 5 almost every single show had an extraneous song in the second set why they put it there i don’t know and removing the song from the second set would make it overall much stronger in many case i feel putting said extra song in the encore would significantly improve the show in other case i felt the extraneous song just killed set energy and should be excised for another night’s set 1 but phish played what they wanted to and i can’t and won’t fault them for that i’ll include my commentary on this with each night’s breakdown to counterbalance this i will also include what in my opinion were the stand out jam for each night in additional commentary below this nitpicking for those of you careful enough to read this post in it entirety i wanted to drop you this little update regarding my matrix of this run i will be doing more than just the jam filled i have posted i’m just waiting on some of the tape i want to use to get uploaded i do not think i’ll have time to do every single show so i am currently planning on doing the cream of the crop from show noted below each show a the standout jam the jam in parenthesis are jam i am on the fence about matrixing if i have the time and energy again keep in mind i’m a few month away from completing a doctorate i will get around to matrixing those jam and eventually i will release the entire thing a a massive compilation if you want to see me matrix jam or song i haven’t listed or think the parenthesis are truly deserving of the matrix please comment or pm me and i’ll take it into consideration and now without further ado here are my thought and ranking of the baker’s dozen wforwumbo’s ranked baker’s dozen 13 7 22 strawberry right off the bat you know this run is special when what wa in my opinion the worst show of the run still contains a nearly 20 minute disease that really go deep a masterful set 1 moma breath and burning a foam bustout that wa executed very cleanly a roggae that absolutely brought the house down a gorgeous squirming coil to close the first set a brilliant cover of strawberry letter 23 complete with a short but spacey dive into the deep end a disease reprise and one of the best encore of the run but what may not have translated on the webcasts wa the general severe drop in energy and dis intrest from the crowd inside the venue there wa load of chatter from most of the audience in the venue in my opinion this show wa the worst offender for talking during jam in the run maybe it’s a function of fewer people there to actually witness the music being in attendance instead attending for the spectacle and bragging right of being at a phish show given that it’s the first saturday show but i also think the fluidity or lack thereof of the setlists is to blame and also love or hate them there is a marimba lumen jam which in my opinion totally killed the energy they had building up in set 2 you can see it in mike he just can’t respond to trey or fish they’re off on their own trip and page is also totally ignored by both of them they follow it up with a bustout that just come across a sleepy and the disease reprise just seems to me like a cheap attempt at unsuccessfully trying to bring back some momentum they had lost you may have been there and been in the pit or lower 100 or this wa the only show of the run you got to catch and you may think it wa a phenomenal show i wouldn’t fault you by any mean i certianly credit the disease encore second set cover and slew of rather strong first set jam overall this really isn’t a terrible show on paper or on tape taken out of context of 2017 this show is a serious heater in pretty much any other year or tour of 3 0 but one show’s gotta take the bottom spot and imo this one’s it extraneous song shine a light it just doesn’t need to be here the disease endcap would have been a plenty fine way to send u to encore and there’s time to kick off the already strong encore with it standout jam mama dance breath and burning roggae down with disease down with disease reprise note i’ve got a two way tie for 11th place here both show are again pretty solid again to show how strong this run is both show tied for 11th are still particularly strong phish show on their own merit but when it come to the rest of the run these to me are a clear cut below the rest again i have to highlight i’m not saying these are bad show but when i decided to compile this list this is where the chip fell in relation to the others 11 7 28 double chocolate chocolate rain wa lot of fun and clearly both the band and audience had lot of fun chalkdust wa a monstrosity and peaked very nicely and cleanly you sexy thing mercury is in my opinion one of the strongest jam of the run and a fee bust out in the encore but outside of sand i thought the rest of this show fell pretty flat set 1 wa rather low energy and not the mellow quiet low energy where the band make you a melted puddle destiny unbound had many clamoring for the bathroom line and this divided sky is one of the most uninspired divided sky i’ve ever seen though the audience roar before the quiet section is one of the loudest i’ve ever seen the outro jam seemed like they were just going through the motion sand wa a great way to prepare people for the incoming set 2 jamming but it wa a bit abbreviated and didn’t go a far a i would have liked to seen set 2’s opener of have mercy might have been a bit stronger had backwards down the number line not totally killed the jamming out of mercury and rock roll seems more like a victory lap than anything and yes the fee encore wa a nice treat but space oddity just seemed extraneous although i’ve seen way too many space oddity i’m in the 50 club for it and many in the building were acting like it wa the first time the band had ever done a cappella space oddity great for them a yawn for me extraneous song line it killed the jamming energy of cdt through mercury stick it in set 1 another night standout jam chalkdust torture you sexy thing mercury you sexy thing 11 8 1 maple o canada opener wa phenomenal seriously they took all the right liberty with it i love the univibe on trey’s guitar here in a pseudo nod to hendrix’s star spangled banner the swept away steep is on my list of jam of the run mcgrupp is my favorite gamehendge tune so i’m happy to see it lxl and walk away were high energy golden age wa monstrous though not at the level of my personal fav golden age 10 20 13 and 8 4 15 and rock n’ roll suicide wa a nice treat in the encore but both on paper and in person the rest of the show is tired sugar shack wa a expected pretty heavily butchered and crowd control through the wedge were super low energy 46 day get the marimba treatment by now you know my opinion of it and piper is sadly too abbreviated oh and this is entirely personal but i really don’t like 3 0 possum especially not in the second set extraneous song possum though i fully understand it wa high energy many loved it and one could argue that it doe kinda belong in this set to close thing out on a high note but on paper and in jamming excise it and the show is much stronger standout jam golden age swept away steep 10 8 5 boston cream this one’s placement so low on the list really highlight just how strong this run is both on paper and on tape this is still an incredibly strong show the ghost is definitely everything to write home about well constructed peaking multiple time and just a joyous celebratory bit of music set 1’s packed with bustouts many of which i’ve seen before sloth fyf soul shakedown party fire plasma frost even alaska which contrary to many opinion i enjoy quite a bit wa well played all of these are strong set 1 offering but set 2 is tired petrichor of which i’m also in the 50 club for is too long to be a landing pad but too short to be a fully realized jam vehicle right now light doesn’t get the treatment it deserves and it feel to me like they kinda mailed it in from horse onwards i’ll give credit where it’s due lizard is played well and sunshine of your feeling wa an absolute blast not to mention it really is the origin of this whole gag no but the show is best summarized by a text from a friend of mine who also attended the show after the encore 500 is what ticket were going for that wa a 500 joy although i should mention i originally had a 3 way tie for 10th and while writing up this list i reflected and realized this show deserved a cut above the other two now tied for 11th extraneous song rocky top put it in the encore after joy to send u out on a high note standout jam sunshine of your feeling plasma ghost light 09 7 29 cinnamon this is where the list got really hard to start compiling ordering the meat and potato of this run wa a tough task but this cinnamon show despite it lower ranking show a marked jump in top to bottom quality and jamming above the show below it to begin with we have the nice do not eat the brown donut woodstock reference pre show a nice nod to historical rock event of year past opening with an absolutely ferocious llama whose return to fast form i gladly welcome and enjoy with that energy carrying through on wilson stftfp and ya mar all four opener just start to get a little out there this is one thing i look for in strong show set 1 not necessarily going off the rail at this age they gotta save something in the tank or else they tend to burn out in set 2 but giving u massive variety in song that otherwise stay a bit constrained especially at the top of the show it also show nice fluidity and that they’ve settled in to the run and the venue at this point the remainder of set 1 is up and down in energy but overall executed well finishing on a massive high note with i am the walrus set 2 is jammed almost perfectly with landing pad spaced out nicely and the stellar alumnus blue letter to jimmy page bust out bringing flub free energy the blaze on is the big jam of the night though the 20yl also get weird and show it strength building on chicago’s offering a a potential massive jam vehicle going forth hood peak nicely and meatstick is almost always fun not to mention this one get weird and space funky towards the end oh yeah and cinnamon girl encore well played and a fitting tribute to neil young extraneous song dirt this is the first show where i’ll argue there really isn’t an extraneous song and it function nicely a a landing pad but if you excise dirt i think this second set is a perfect 10 and the 20yl already served a an earlier landing pad standout jam wilson stealing time from the faulty plan ya mar blaze on 20 year later meatstick 08 7 21 coconut opening night lot of energy and excitement the vibe and energy in the air wa palpable not to mention there wa this overall feeling of we have no idea what they’re gonna do the sky’s really the limit after the five pre run show the fan base descended on msg and you could tell from the get go this would be different lot of finger in the air out front people traveling from all over to witness this historic event ben jerry’s out front people watching and making new friend also there to join me in witnessing this show poster line i remember thinking a i approached msg before the show it’s nice to be back on tour’ again reba and moonage daydream stand out in set 1 and almost all of set 2 ha near perfect fluidity and strong jamming the tweezer 7 is strong on it own another standout of the run plus a deep everything’s right a tune i am learning to look forward to a of this tour plus a slave that a usual doe not fail to deliver set 1 ha it tired part pigtail and wotc is a song i personally don’t enjoy getting live yes i like wotc overall a a song but i’ve yet to see a version in 3 0 that differs from any other version and i get it way too much mango i’ve seen the last four and gtbt are a nice way to send u home with a smile on our face and leave u begging for the rest of the run to come sooner extraneous song either billy breathes or sparkle despite it being played very tightly i feel the same way about sparkle in 3 0 a i do about wotc plus i get it way too much and i’ve seen it derail set 2 energy which it thankfully didn’t do here but only one of these song need to exist here a a landing pad standout jam tweezer seven below everything’s right slave to the traffic light 07 8 6 glazed bookending the run this one shoot above night 1 based on the pure emotion of this show the band pulled it off and it didn’t really all hit me until i walked outside the venue and realized it wa all over i wasn’t a wreck like some of my friend were but yeah it hit me set 1 is a bit of a roller coaster itself with trey butchering rift and immediately following it up with an almost self aware ha ha ha camel walk is a personal favorite set 1 tune and both crazy sometimes and most event aren’t planned had my brain on the floor bug is nice though i wa looking forward to it placement a a set 2 landing pad i been around wa a nice bustout wa at the last one in 2014 and it had a similar effect here and izabella had me going nut a i grew up cutting my teeth on a vhs copy of hendrix live at woodstock and i haven’t even touched set 2 yet simple wa brilliant starman is the ziggy stardust tune i’ve been waiting to see live and yem is always yem i won’t even mention the encore a it’s been discussed ad nauseum extraneous song loving cup seriously move it to the encore standout jam most event aren’t planned izabella simple on the road again tweezer reprise a two way tie for fifth i really couldn’t pick one of these over the other both from memory on playback from tape and on paper have their merit and if i had to pick one over the other it’d be a real coin toss 05 8 4 lemon pyite wa very clean strong first tube but this show exists for the second set dem bone is the extranous tune otherwise this is straight non stop and cohesive jamming nminml wa massive and funky everything in it right place shot a jolt of energy through the crowd wtu obviously ha a special place in my heart scent wa funky and a bit abbreviated for my taste but still very strong caspian peak super hard and fluffhead is the well deserved and tightly executed victory lap the cherry on top of this set oh and the frankenstein encore had that super cool pulsating single chord drone to distinguish itself from other frankenstein extraneous song dem bone standout jam punch you in the eye no men in no man’s land everything in it right place what’s the use scent and subtle sound prince caspian 05 7 23 red velvet witnessing this show wa ethereal especially so early in the run when they pulled off this show i honestly walked out thinking jeez it’s only the first weekend the sky really is the limit for them right now sunday morning wa the phishiest way possible to open the show how many people are you got the jamming treatment it deserved it’s ice need i say too much about this one it’s a beast harkening back to 1 0 version and wolfman’s through wave elevated me to another plane and i wa sober sweet jane wa a great send home tune too i’ve been chasing that one for a while now and it bookmarked the show and first weekend well the only criticism i can find about this show are 1 i wanted bag to return to it former late 1 0 glory a a jam vehicle and while it wa well played here sadly it didn’t get walked and 2 boogie on wa just starting to grow leg and seriously go for a walk before sadly being antipasto’d for wading i get that they wanted to do the gag but seriously just walk boogie on and put wading in the first set or encore though in the encore we then probably wouldn’t have gotten sweet jane extraneous song wading in the velvet sea standout jam how many people are you it’s ice wolfman’s brother twist wave 04 7 30 jimmy now we and the show are seriously cooking it’s nice to see such a well oiled machine pull this off with masterful execution they nailed curtain with jim i am torn on because it’s a great way to get people grooving and always consistenlty get happy but like bag i wanted to see it return to it former 1 0 status glory but i will rarely complain about runaway jim esther brian and robert and forbin mockingbird bust out and a well played bowie round out set 1 the only criticism i can find with set 1 and for the most part the show is home but given that it’s set 1 and they still played it well i won’t criticize too harshly set 2 is all meat little fluff drowned through 2001 is a good a it look on paper both drowned and asihtos deserve to be in talk for jam of the run and combine for nearly 40 minute of jamming not stats you see for two song in 3 0 that much golgi is the nicely played and well deserved victory lap on the show and wind cry mary is nice in the encore slot extraneous song in the good old summer time seriously excise it and you have another perfect 10 of a set i’d argue that without good old summer time this second set would be in talk for set of the run move it to the encore or to set 1 and this show jump up significantly i know many of you are probably getting sick of me for complaining about getting more phish song but these are my taste i’m not saying it shouldn’t be in this show just not in the second set standout jam drowned a song i heard the ocean sing 2001 and now we have the top 3 these show really are a cut above the rest overall some of the best phish i have ever witnessed 03 7 26 powdered i’ve been a big fleet fox fan for some time now and especially being in the taper’s section recording this show i wa happy to inform all of my fellow taper about this cover which i should note wa performed pretty solidly given all of the a cappella that happened at this run ctb is a nice tune to get people grooving the very long fuse is one of my two favorite chilling thrilling song so i wa happy to see it i view it a a mellower and slightly funkier split open and melt gumbo wa strong and pebble and marble is probably my personal favorite bustout of the run but then we get to the real body of this show and it start at the end of set 1 tube wow just wow i wa speechless this is a jammed out tube and it peak so nicely from here on out we are treated to one special jam after another carini mr completely 1999 jam steam all of them executed masterfully and truly going to exploratory and experimental place that only phish can take u to i will also admit this show had the absolutely impossible task of following night 4 and they still managed to pull a true heater out of their bag of trick no quarter wa a great and spacey way to round out all the jamming and the powderfinger wa expected at this point but still welcome the only criticism i have is ch zero seems like a cheaper version of their victory lap but i’ll admit it still did some cool stuff and i got to groove to it extraneous song character zero though i’ll admit this second set can’t end on no quarter perhaps swap it with tube given that tube get the same jammed out treatment or maybe powderfinger and leave ch zed a the send u home with a smile on our face tune again this is starting to really split hair and nitpick which is a very nice change of pace for criticizing phish in my opinion standout jam tube carini mr completely 1999 jam steam 02 8 2 hole very little filler and even when it’s there it’s used a a much needed and well earned breather executed perfectly from top to bottom i wa surprised that many didn’t know way down in the hole i’m a fan of the wire and wa able to pick it out immediately and buried alive wa fiery kdf and guyute kept the energy going and i didn’t know wa phishy antic at their phishiest let’s face it that’s one reason we go to lot of show nicu wa played well and got thing grooving again meat wa thicc tm and funky maze peaked hard and strong ginseng through heavy thing wa mellow and patient and antelope just flat out raged in true set 1 antelope style but the set 2 is just about a close to pure perfection a phish could get for a set 2 and for that matter a show a a whole mike’s o holy night competes for my favorite jam of the run it peak well and hard not to mention the gag wa tied in wonderfully and in a rarity for the run contributed to the jamming it wa spacey and ethereal truly unreal taste is very strong wingsuit is strong contrary to many i love wingsuit and feel it’s an appropriate landing pad here allowing phish to get their pink floyd on sally groove is fantastic extraneous song for the first and only time i really don’t think there is one if i had to pick one i’d say sally a it’s the only song that didn’t really get the jammed out treatment but i’m not going to complain at all about it being here this is really a fantastic set top to bottom and i think could arguably be the best set of the run standout jam run like an antelope mike’s song o holy night taste sneaking sally through the alley weekapaug grove 01 7 25 jam filled you kinda had to know this wa coming from top to bottom this show is just unreal i remember during set break telling some of my friend that i wa witnessing possibly the best phish show i would ever see i also made the effort to at the beginning of the first song of the evening turn off my phone a it wa blowing up with text from friend and just tuning out everything aside from the music in this show thankfully this show rewarded me for doing so in my book you can put this show in it entirety up against any show going back to big cypress yes i do know the catalog pretty well and it will win i don’t know if it’s still there but i think this show doe deserve a firm seat a second best of all time sorry cypress’s project sunrise will never be toppled unless they try it again in the phish canon and i’m about a jaded a the vet still following this band come i gotta say i think there were a number of factor outside the music that also contributed to this show’s status firmly in the 1 seat firstly very little to no audience chatter i think that especially being a midweek show and also being so early in the run this show wa mostly attended by phish’s die hard fan i wa hesitant a to how blocking off the back portion of the undersold venue would fare but i remember thinking after this show and the next night’s powdered donut thinking if that’s what it take for phish to play this way can they please never sell the back of the venue it’s classic phish to make people regret not going to the undersold show see 11 2 98 and the fact we can discus these two show in the same sentence show just how strong jam filled really is i think there wa a bit of pre meditation into constructing this show which ruin the allure a bit but the strenght of jamming all around quickly make me forget that nitpick i also went in with zero expectation after red velvet night in my comment history for this show’s setlist thread i commented on my way to the venue that i would trust the band could do just about anything and they’d pull it off well and this show delivers that in spade now let’s start from the top shall we sample it wa incredible once the jam start you can hear the audience go electric though i’ll admit the tape just don’t hold the same energy it really wa special and the band rewarded the roar of approval from the audience with some tasty tasty jamming just like the roggae from strawberry night the audience wa pin drop silent outside of the necessary roar of approval when jam peaked lawn boy normally like many other tune i’ve mentioned here lawn boy is one of the song that get a groan from me a it just never doe anything particularly special feel kinda lazy and get the chatter chatting quite heavily i’ve been told this song is not meant for you which really is true especially a a jam chaser well tonight proved that 100 wrong and now lawn boy will forever have a special place in my heart from the get go with page bringing out the keytar and at the first left turn we knew something sepcial wa about to happen especially given the theme of the evening people around me were clamoring the now famous is this still lawn boy line throughout the jam and the peak are extremely celebratory and not just the lazy peaking argument i gave about much of 2016 phish a theme of this run my friend my friend well how the hell do you follow up that lawn boy with this nice gem get just weird enough to not be fully type 1 towards the end but doesn’t have the depth or length to be a monstro wait this is still set 1 and this song is still not standard it’s gonna be a very special night stash jeez are they gonna give u anything to criticize in this show this stash flirt with but never end up breaking free from it constraint lot of chromatic interplay between mike page and trey and fishman is a usual his machine like self pounding away at those skin like there’s no tomorrow and keeping u locked in to some semblance of reality while we get slungshot over the moon bathtub gin type 1 but super frickin’ happy type 1 gin is my favorite jam vehicle thanks to those millennial late 90 version and while this one doesn’t compare to those or some of the numerous 3 0 monstrosity we’ve been getting recently it’s a solid way to end cap a five song jammed out first set i can’t stress that enough i guess they gotta save something for the second set fuego seems they’re not here to fuck around tonight while not the monstrosity of lawn boy or the incoming crosseyed it still hold it own especially on replaying this tape i wa mildly hopeful given the theme that this version would be enough to dethrone 7 4 14 a the best fuego but seriously given this entire show i’m not gonna split hair thread ever since hearing this tune from chicago i’ve been wondering just how they execute it and the answer is i still don’t know it’s clearly well rehearsed complex phish that’s got odd time signature when it tonal and totally jazzy and off the deep end when it’s atonal lot of complex composition this is a very mature phish i wish they wrote more stuff like this in the modern era rather than the dad rock centric sizable maritime vessel either way in my book it ha a happy and accepted place in the canon of this show and phish’s catalog crosseyed wow just wow all around possibly the strongest jam of the run well constructed multiple passage that are all cohesive on their own strengthened by equally cohesive transition between passage a floaty ambient spacey dive into the deep end in the middle section bookended by two very celebratory fluid and happy segment on either side each with multiple peak i along with the rest of the venue wa very in to this jam makisupa we need a cool down right nope time to start going off the rail deep in to the jam fun keywords and interplay during composed portion and the outdo get super spacey dropping u in to end of session well one of my favorite phish song get it premier in my favorite phish show i’ve attended perfect placement ethereal and spacey give u a chance to catch our breath and also take stock of where the hell we’ve ended up in this show tuesday the only nitpick i have of this show i’ll leave it at that and expand below because i really won’t complain too much with a show like this cavern perfect way to cap off this set tightly played and clearly they’re having a blast julius lawn boy reprise see my comment re cavern and the lawn boy reprise just serf to reinforce that lawn boy and this show truly are jam filled extraneous song tuesday i get why they put it here and yeah they’re just having fun but it kinda temporarily broke the wall of perfection they had built up to that point and excising it make this show a perfect 10 all around that said they did recover from it without missing a beat and the show is still strong with it in there not to mention they did need a landing pad of some sort outside of the complex and intricate thread which i don’t think serf it full job a a landing pad and which is also why i find thread that much more impressive in this show i am looking forward to thread’s outro getting seriously jammed standout jam the entire thing really save for tuesday well that about wrap it up feel free to respond or comment on my thought below let’s start a discussion
1,i think 8 1 2nd set is one of my favorite phish set in just under 80 show 8 1 is not pretty on paper and the 1st set wa lacking energy imo i m usually all about the dark dance funk show high energy with darkness and tension yet this contemplative mostly ambient 2nd set blew my mind i wa sober and is a contender for my personal top 5 show attended if you have not give the 2nd set a listen start to finish the start of leaf is a bit of a lull in song 2 but the ambient jam set the tone for the rest of the set and a 3 4min marimba drum jam is 46 day is a fun live antic but also a bit of a lull imo this is one of the rare show that had 4th quarter jamming that wa a explorative a the 3rd quarter the song length are all sub 15min so the jam on paper may seem uninteresting outside the 20min ga which ironically wa the least interesting of the major jam imo in particular golden age swept away piper were all top shelf jam leaf is slow but the ambient jam set the stage for the rest of the set that built ambient energy culminating in possum explosion 46 day is a solid jam though derailed by the lumen antivs possum is an insane peak to close it possum i generally feel is just a fun set 1 tune preferably opener or closer but that possum wa an unreal peak and cap to what i thought wa an nearly perfect 2nd set 46 day wa a good jam and at the show the drum and lumen game are fun and a brief pause from the intense type 2 jamming that started with golden age and never really let up though lumen section are musically shit and not great for relisten a brief 3 5 min one doesn t bother me cuz it fun live in small dos if they stay there for 8 10min let alone 15 20min i d be upset

1,this ought to put the mike hate phish rumor to rest so often i hear people saying stuff like mike seems to just be going through the motion he always smile more with his own band phish is just like his day job leaving aside that these kind of sentiment discount the clear effort and investment mike put into his playing each night mike recently had this to say on twitter almost every day with phish brings me inspiration to bring to my band like listening surrendering and having simple song trey is a great leader because he keep vibe and energy a the main focus and encourages the people around him

1,til phish learned barbershop quartet from page s landlord and the vocal blending technique they learned by doing barbershop influenced their songwriting on rift source phish apprenticed with a master of barbershop quartet who just happened to be mcconnell s landlord when mcconnell said he played in a band his landlord responded oh i m kind of into music myself i have a barbershop group instead of chuckling to himself a the average musician might have done page saw an opportunity for the band to further expand it horizon he wa an international judge for barbershop for about thirty year said mcconnell turned out he wa able to give u lesson and we ordered a bunch of music source part of the art of barbershop quartet is blending the sound mcconnell explains i think we re blending better now on all our singing a a result of that i don t think any one of u ha the greatest voice anastasio admits but with barbershop we can blend and make beautiful music this is quite evident in their latest album titled rift which in fact doe not include any overt barbershop but show marked advance in their vocal work over their three earlier album

1,ebay possible ticket scam so i bid on some floor on ebay for the opening weekend at msg i entered a max bid that matched the stub hub lowest price my thought were even if i win at my max bid i will at least save on the absurd stub hub fee the ticket were listed individually for each night with 2min left i wa winning with like 60 to spare from my max bid i knew there would be some sniper so i expected it to at least get close to my max bid well it did and i wa outbid at the very last second by one increment i know i know this is ebay and this is how people win item but it seems phishy and here is why the ticket both ended with price higher than the current stub high price to the point where it would almost be a wash with the fee but wait there is more le than an hour after the auction end they both ended within 5min of each other i got a second chance offer for the same ezxact ticket both of them to buy it now at the price of my max bid this got me thinking i highly doubt the buyer for both ticket backed out in le than hour it wa stated you have 24 hour to pay for the item my tinfoil hat theory is that the seller used another account to bid until they won then backed out this then gave them the option to offer m e the ticket at my current max bid when in reality i would have won the ticket for at least 40 le i have 12 hour left to decide on this what doe reddit think should i say fuck this person for being shady and pay a few more dollar on stubhub should i just suck it up and buy the ticket since i will save a few dollar anyone think price will drop currently just over 200 for floor ticket for friday and saturday opening weekend just looking for some opinion thanks enjoy your tour

1,the wildest nyc prediction analysis i ve ever seen source unknown check it absolute zero what would it take for phish to perform the entire msg baker s dozen run without a single repeat to get an idea i looked at some phish statistic from the last three year starting with the msg 2013 nye run and continuing up until their most recent show this january in mexico i also analyzed specific 13 show consecutive run from the last three summer from 12 28 13 to 1 15 17 phish played 124 show performing 2 665 total song for an average of 21 song per night during this time 300 unique song were performed 98 song were played were played at least ten time or once every 12 13 show 30 song were played at least once every five show 78 were onetimers 222 song were performed more than once ignoring auld lang syne and star spangled banner this leaf 220 tube which we can consider currently in rotation in the last three year 54 song were debut meaning a new song wa introduced every 2 25 show since the msg 13 run and mexico 17 run included no debut the calendar year 14 15 and 16 can be said to feature an average 18 debut per annum of these debut 18 were cover specific to the occasion including is this what you wanted playing in the band samson and delilah take me out to the ballgame the ocean united we stand west la fadeaway and the 11 song from ziggy stardust additionally auld lang syne and star spangled banner were both both performed three time and can be considered to fall into the ad hoc cover category of the 2 665 song from the period in question only three are considered jam drive in jam 8 22 15 jam 7 27 14 tweeprise jam 12 28 16 discarding these 23 ad hoc selection the band ha 277 song from the last three year to choose from 57 of which are onetimers additionally if the band keep pace with their current debut rate they could be expected to introduce up to 18 new song in their msg run presumably 2 3 of which would be rolled out during their upper midwest tour beginning this weekend the gd song would have the highest likelihood of reprisal especially in the welcome event of guest appearance from any member of the dead fam and since the band average one jam per year we could expect to see another during this run looking at run of 13 consecutive show from the last three july the band average 278 total song and 145 unique song per each 13 show period this amount to about 21 song per night in keeping with average of the last three year in total from 7 11 14 to 7 30 14 phish performed 123 unique song 45 of which were onetimers from 7 21 15 to 8 8 15 the band performed 126 unique song 58 of which were onetimers from 7 1 16 to 7 22 16 they played 186 unique song 106 different song in this run were played only one time during these period in 2014 and 2015 most song were played twice in the 2016 run most song happened only once largely due to the bustouts on 7 20 for each of these run fuego is at least tied for the most played song occurring seven five and four time respectively if the band were to perform song at the frequency of 2014 we could except to hear 23 song played thrice over the baker s dozen run if they perform with the frequency of 2016 there would only be 5 song performed three time over the 13 night at msg phish can be expected to perform about 21 song per night totaling between 270 and 280 song over the course of the run to do so without any repeat the band would probably have to include nearly each of the 220 song currently in rotation this leaf 50 60 song to speculate on these song will draw from a those played only once over the last three year b debut either original or cover and c bustouts of the nearly 600 additional song found in the band s catalogue raisonné if phish come to new york city and play 270 unique song over the course of 13 show this will be the rarest period in the band s existence my prediction are of the 220 song currently in rotation we hear 216 of these of the 78 song played only once in the last three year we will hear 26 of these an additional 13 song will be played from the band s repertoire that have not been heard in the last 124 show chance are a bulk of these will wind up in a single set i e 12 31 13 or 7 20 16 17 new song will be performed at msg including up to three debuted in the earlier july show 11 of the 17 will be part of larger project the question remains whether these are cover or original the band will play 1 untitled jam this total 273 song 273 c is considered absolute zero the lowest possible theoretic temperature incidentally 273 is also the number of second in john cage s landmark silent piece 4 33 my prediction is that we will see 273 unique song over the course of the msg run achieving absolutely zero repeat in conclusion below are the song in heavy rotation each of which have been played 28 time or more over the last 124 show if they don t attempt a completely unique song selection and the band approach the baker s dozen a it would a typical run of 13 show you can plan on seeing about 4 fuego 3 moma s and 2 gin top 22 most frequently played phish song 12 28 13 1 15 17 fuego 46 day 555 ghost twist chalk dust torture harry hood

1,first time at northerly island
1,noob here question about how set work
1,how about that chi town simple that wa a 27 minute monster where for almost half of the jam i wa expecting a timber segue or a transition into light and kept second guessing what song i wa even listening to that simple wa anything but simple i might need to get bd ticket
1,they are not fucking around just spent that show 5th row mike side absolutely incredible two show and this feel world better than 2016 and i even had a blast at wrigley
1,to the tall bros at northerly island who said do girl even like phish i gave you the short answer yes girl do like phish a lot but the real answer is that yea we love phish we play phantasy tour we go to magnaball we go to the haunted vega set and you know what i personally love i love that phish show are the only place where woman don t wait in line for the bathroom the men s line is long and it just feel so great to be a female phish fan but for real tonight s show wa great but the attitude of the aging crowd is slightly le hospitable and phriendly let s keep it 100 and not get crotchety
1,tonight s winterqueen cured my case of being a set ii bumout grouch it s not like i fell in love with winterqueen but after tonight i feel like i finally understand why the band ha placed it after so many great set ii jam the band really sold it a a tune that can simmer thing down but keep the juice flowing my quick reaction is that 7 15 17 winterqueen is my favorite version ever only because i love it versus every other version that kinda disappointed me i vow to be more patient with song i have previously considered 2nd set bumouts this post is meant to be positive i really liked tonight s 2nd set winterqueen for the first time ever and that make me optimistic for future 2nd set ballad between great improvisational event aside from wingsuit and farmhouse i reserve my right to the opinion that wingsuit is cheesy a shit and that farmhouse kill exciting 2nd set energy
1,the summer of page synth i know there have only been two show thus far but holy shit it s the summer of page crushing with that synth i m glad he ha a new probably old toy to play with i m sure a lot of people will be way more welcoming to this over the marimba lumen which i ll never understand the hate for
1,everything s right and more i wasn t able to stream night one so i am listening now and aside from the cool jam towards the end isn t everything s right pretty similar in music and message to more i like em both and this is one of the coolest song debut i ve heard in a long time
1,the truth about wingsuit 1 there are lyric about golf and they suck 2 the other lyric that are not about golf also suck 3 that outro solo and jam are transcendent thought wa last night s version an aha moment for you do you still hate it with a burning passion do you just love the lyric about golf
1,the new light are gonna look amazing indoors watching this of last night s jaw dropping simple got me thinking this is clearly a light rig built for msg the rig look a bit funny under that giant festival style stage especially when ck5 brings it down close to the band but in an arena where the band is in the middle of the action with people behind them this rig is gonna give new meaning to mothership too bad there s no hampton this summer picture the yem vocal jam when he doe the whole spaceship landing thing w the light to literally have the light come down right on top of the band oh yea tldr i can t fucking wait for bd

1,page s new synthesizer so i have to say i ve been absolutely floored by the new synth work from page so far in chicago it s taking jam into deeper direction and allowing the band to explore an entirely new framework for jam i wa browsing instagram this afternoon and came across this which confirms that page ha added a new bit of gear to his rig a dave smith instrument prophet 08 this is a classic analog synth or for certain model like his prophet 08 an analog synth with digital knob control made famous by stevie wonder herbie hancock vangelis think the blade runner and chariot of fire soundtrack and thom yorke it s also worth noting page had an original sequential circuit prophet 5 in his rig back in the late 90 it wa the synth responsible for lot of the layered and textured loop jam think big cypress sand for example this would explain how many of the jam are starting to swing out into that spacey layered and textured vibe a la the late 90 if trey start abusing his leslie rotary speaker again this year we re in for some really detailed and washy jam color me very excited for those of you at the pre bd show enjoy getting lost in the glorious wash that this beast can produce it s been next on my must purchase synth list for a while now and a we re witnessing firsthand with phish it can produce some absolutely monstrous sound ninja edit it s worth noting it look like page ha the prophet mounted immediately above his trusty yamaha c 80 so he can play both at the same time needle to say it s gonna be a good summer edit 2 also if trey brings back the yamaha an 1x synth like he used to have in 99 00 we re in for some serious mind melting jam

1,next stop the erwin j nutter center this train ha no brake
1,page new synthesizer an update now with more synths now that the new video from this northery run ha been released by phish i decided to sit down and watch them in action while executing this masterful jam i also had a tiny hope i d get a closer look at some of the new gear they re using and boy did the video deliver i snapped this at the 11 21 mark which give u a decent view of page s entire setup this answer many of the question i ve had about how he s accomplishing lot of the texture that he is turn out he s now running three synthesizer in his keyboard rig a moog minimoog voyager at least i think it s a voyager and not the voyager xl a it seems to only have 44 key which is responsible for some of the sustained tone it is sitting right above his wurlitzer page play it in tandem with the wurlitzer right when this simple start taking off you can hear it come in a the long sustained note at 6 15 in the video you can also get a very clear shot of him playing the voyager at 13 00 minute in to the video a yamaha synth that sits a usual for the past few year atop his rhodes if you look just a fraction of a second earlier from the above screenshot in this other you can see that it is indeed a yamaha c 60 there wa some discussion in my last thread regarding page s synths a to what exactly it wa and this clearly confirms that it s the c 60 which page ha notably had for all of 3 0 it s unclear a per if he had a c 80 back in the late 90 if you want an example of what this synth sound like think of what s the use or meatstick the dave smith instrument prophet 08 it sits on top of the c 60 i haven t found a clear example in this video yet of him using the prophet i ll dig though the sound clip of this weekend to see if i can point to a concrete example of it being used in the meantime is an okay overview of a bunch of sound that it is capable of though note that despite the insane flexibility shown here it can do much much more than what is in the video that seems to settle a decent number of question i and others seemed to have excited to see how this pan out for the rest of tour my comment from my last post about iawitw trey s re addition of the yamaha an1x trey s increased reliance on the leslie rotary speaker could push jam to a new stratosphere still hold

1,why doesn t phish do this with tm so i went to buy some u2 tix today well after they went on sale a i m trying to score tix lo and behold there are ga tix available i thought it wa odd a band a big a u2 wouldn t have sold out the floor but without further ado went and purchase them then i had the aha moment u2 only sell floor a credit card entry only in other word by buying the ticket you agree that they cannot be transferred in any way shape or form can t make the gig tough so my question is why won t phish do this clearly there is a huge demand for ticket and this obviously prevents scalping obviously not every ticket is going to be this way but it certainly guarantee that those who have made an effort to see them i e time off work travel plan actually get to what would be your thought if phish did this
1,friday night replay deer creek 96
1,just a story i wanted to share with you all i am a little late sharing this story but i immediately thought of r phish when it happened and finally got around to typing it out it probably will seem pointless or lackluster especially now that i ve waited but it amused me so here it go for those of you who don t know there is a cover band in chicago called sixteen candle now the thing about this cover band is they play just about every street festival there is in chicago all year round chance are if you ve ever been to a chicago street festival and heard a cover band it wa sixteen candle they are pretty good a far a cover band go they play music that a crowd like you know come on ilene take on me some queen i m sure oh and they also have a way of creeping up on you you don t even realize you re listening to the same band you heard at the last festival until they finish a song and announce they re sixteen candle anyway it wa about a week ago and i had just been standing around at another chicago street fest well street art fair listening to another cover band play their second round of jesse s girl in three song that s right two jesse s girl in three song and my buddy and i were talking about how it wa probably sixteen candle up there again when the singer finished up a song and announced that they were indeed sixteen candle my friend and i started talking about how maybe it s just sixteen candle or maybe it s something about chicago street festival in general but they all seem to blend together and feel the same no matter which one or where they are but then in the humid chattery downtime between 80 cover something happened the guitarist ripped a tweezer riff this wa doubly cool because my friend and i had just been talking about my love of phish and how he wa a phan for a while in the 90 before losing touch so the guitarist played a couple bar of tweezer and bailed then they went back into a third round of jesse s girl just kidding but i am truly still perplexed by why they played two jesse s girl in three song anyway the band played a couple more song and then bam divided sky riff which the singer talked over and wouldn t humor a little more downtime and then fluffhead riff no bite from the singer that time either anyway there might have been one more riff the guitarist laid down but each time the singer kind of threw a wet blanket on it i guess i understand their gig is to play springsteen and stuff i just thought it wa sweet to get to jam to phish tune even if only for a moment at one of chicago s dozen of generic street festival side note if you are a phish fan and are familiar with the ubiquitous chicago street festival cover act that is sixteen candle you will understand that this wa a truly unexpected experience so that s what i came here to share phish is in more place than you know and sometimes pop up when you least expect it

1,f 2 for nutter dayton for face value pm me if you re interested
1,will they repeat a song during the bd when the show were first announced i figured they would definitely repeat song but a time ha passed a couple thing have changed my perspective 1 trey s overall excitement in interview 2 the fact that they sold people like myself on committing to all 13 show 3 it push the boundary of what phish can do it s a challenge and something they ve never done before a of now i m entirely convinced they won t repeat a song i know that would require a lot of digging into the catalog and would take a many song a they typically play in a full tour but that essentially what this is anyway i do think we ll know fairly early on if they re gonna repeat or not if they play all of their typical banger in the first weekend then it s likely they ll repeat if they only play a few then they re likely stretching the catalog a far a possible

1,what to do with old show disc have hundred upon hundred and trying to purge my hoarding i know you guy can relate i have probably 500 disc of live show of gd phish etc spread across 9 binder but honestly i haven t used these disc since like 2007 they re collecting dust in my closet next to my phish and dead cassette tape lol i remember the moment i realize it wa silly to have them a friend s gf wa over and saw the disc and joked people still use these thinking back on the memory of listening to these disc and all the time i spent burning them make me reluctant to toss them at the same time who the hell want them that i could give them to i assume you guy likewise consume show via stream sirius ipod spotify etc i could always hold onto them where they will stay in the closet or bookcase of my future home collecting new dust next to my original nintendo and other thing i can t bring myself to part with
1,can you guy recommend any show jam to get me a huge deadhead into phish hey all i hope the title doesn t come across the wrong way i e a douchey or condescending i m sure you get these post a lot but i m a big deadhead in fact i m sure there are many of you here i ve listened to hundred of show they re practically all i listen to but it didn t start that way i didn t hear the dead for the first time and just fall in love it took a couple of try until i found something that stuck and it opened me up to the rest of their catalogue where i wa able to appreciate what i didn t see before same thing happened with dylan thus my philosophy ha generally been a john mayer put it you just haven t gotten into the dead yet of course this isn t true for everyone but i ve seen it happen a lot with the dead and jam band a a whole so i have a feeling it s that same way in regard to my relationship with phish i ve heard some of their stuff both live and studio and have generally liked what i ve heard but i haven t really gotten into them i m very open to all music and i want to immerse myself for the day so could you do me a favor and hit me with some killer jam show that you think would translate well to a deadhead something i love about the dead is that they re kind of messy sloppy but they roll with it they jam and just play what s in the air mistake and all and it just seems to work one of the turnoff and very unfairly so of phish to me so far ha been that they re too tight so in addition to the best your favorite jam could you recommend anything that s a bit more mellow maybe even a little sloppy i love the energy of phish and i m really excited to start this musical journey thanks so much in advance p s sorry for being super wordy am on drug and talkative at the moment

1,interesting catch in the tahoe tweezer i just caught this little bit for the first time while listening to the renowned tahoe tweezer for the umpteenth time one of the thing that phans love to talk about most is how the band is always playing off each other and always seem to know exactly when to build into peak or segue into different jam section for me i ve really always wondered how they know exactly what note to play in order to always sound in sync during type ii i hope you guy find this a interesting a i did when i heard it but if you listen just to paige at 26 10 26 16 you can hear him happen across the main chord that will build into the peak instantly he know he ha something good and a few second later mike pick up on it and follows surprisingly trey is the last to the party but also hears it and recognizes it a something hot a few second after mike and the boy are off on one of the most famous jam build and peak in history i re listened to this 15 second stretch about 10 time to make sure i had it right obviously this tweezer is legendary for the type ii and i think this is about a clear cut a it get for an example of the boy instantly happening on a musical phrase and turning it into something magical
1,i gave trey a letter last night at tab in charlotte and he read it so a few week ago knowing that i wa going to see tab in charlotte i decided to write the man a letter it wa about 2 and a half page long basically just expressed what his music and phish meant to me everything it ha done for me the experience i ve had because of it and how it s helped me through some very rough time also said thank you 4 or 5 time lol rode the rail to give it to him wa almost dead center and after an extra long set 1 i held it up and he took it backstage with him during intermission he came back out for set 2 and after the second song i wa looking at him and cheering he turned and pointed at me i wa like me and he said yeah you this is for you he proceeded to play the song alive again which corresponded to a big emotional part of the letter i wrote him i ve never been happier after the epic 4 song encore he shook my hand before going backstage this wa one of the best experience of my entire life and i m terribly happy right now just wanted to share this with people i thought would appreciate it i ve always thought trey is such a genuine and caring guy and this confirmed it tl dr wrote and gave a letter to trey he read it and played a song for me about part of it shook my hand afterward he s a great dude edit wow can t believe the response this ha gotten thank you all for your kind word only time i ve ever read like 40 comment on reddit that were all positive the phunion even posted it kinda crazy love you all

1,curious about mike led jamming the question is often asked who is leading the jam and in general the easy answer is trey and to a lesser extent page since their instrument lend themselves more directly towards that end but there are numerous example of both fish and mike taking charge and directing the proceeding in the late 90 mike did this with more regularity resulting in some of the big groove based jam template that sprung out of vehicle like ghost piper halley s and more here is but one example of the form the great wood piper from 09 11 2000 i recommend this entire set from the extended raging type i of chalkdust to the about to burst at the seam pregnant energy of twist to the soupy groove of piper to the unique bit of mike improv in wtu and finally through the capstone yem that act a punctuation on the proceeding back then they only needed these five song to craft an engaging journey into phishlandia what is your favorite mike led excursion

1,wading in the velvet sea used to be a very different song we all know the song a it appears on ghost and is performed live but i m not sure many people realize how much it ha changed the demo that trey and tom recorded when they were developing much of ghost and farmhouse is very different from the final product for one we hear a different opening progression that seems to rise rather than fall second the chorus i ve been wading in the velvet sea is repeated throughout the song and over the verse most notably though is the lack of a bridge the bm c progression that occurs after the verse and before the solo which ultimately brings in an am that is probably one of my favorite chord change is not present the song repeat the chorus and maintains the g d em c d pattern when it wa played live in 1997 in both europe and the u the live version were still based very heavily on this demo you can hear the sound in this rather haunting rendition from when phish started bringing it into rotation in 1997 it kept much of the demo s signature feature in addition to the overall structure such a the siren and repeated chorus throughout it doe however incorporate soloing from trey at the end a well a a revised and more iconic piano intro from page when the song returned for the 1998 tour it wa a we know it now and a it appears on the album if any of you have some insight a to how or when or why it changed i d love to hear about it thanks for reading

only from afar it had more of an impact than we could have ever realized at the time but whether we knew it or not since the first time we encountered it it altered u changed u touched u affected u and from that point forward it permeated our being and ha come through the music we play the gig we book the article we write the concert we promote the audience member we are the food we cook the grace with which we handle the challenge of life he didn t take most thing too seriously and that obviously rubbed off quite a bit on more than a few of u but for what he did the degree of intention to his intent also meant that he wa really not fuckin around and at the pinnacle of his musical life in front of a sold out crowd at arguably the most beautiful theater in the country with a stage full of the most talented collective i ve ever been a part of ranging in age from our early teen to our mid 70 s supported by equally talented promoter manager caterer etc all of whom were there because they loved the man for how good he made each and every one of them feel about whatever they brought to the table he sang out one last time let it shine let it shine let it shine with all the love in his heart and he meant every word just a he always did but this time the intent overwhelmed the vessel a we were walking away from the venue in the shock and confusion of the moment after his collapse a fellow musician posed the question did he really just take it there yep yes he did he just took it there that wa the release a lifetime s worth of everything that a life a full a bruce s could contain besides the consistency with which bruce valued intent and adhered to the now he had an equally deep appreciation for good showmanship and an extraordinary eye for talent he being exhibit a of the former and absolutely all the member of the various band he lead being example of the latter he also had a tremendous sense of humor which allowed him to embrace the ludicrousness of virtually everything with good nature and a deep laugh i once asked him how the hell he put together band after band of the baddest mother s i d ever seen on whatever instrument and his response wa fish every band only need one wrecking ball they put it up and i tear it down being that a it is i find it virtually impossible to view the manner in which he departed a anything other than the ultimate theatrical accomplishment practical joke paradoxical expressionistic heeeyyeeaarrrr whaaaaahhho ah haa ha ha hhhaaaaaa intended to elicit the entire range of human emotion and response in one fell swoop to seamlessly transition from shine ee to shine er in one love intent filled moment leaving u all laughing cry and astonished at the same time i just can t help feeling that being in the moment a always he saw the opportunity to make it a real a it get comparable to nothing and took it and i believe he took it for our benefit certainly not at our expense because that could never be his intent but still to intend it is one thing to actually pull it off viewed from this angle it s certainly the greatest act of showmanship i expect to ever witness in my lifetime short of spontaneous combustion which i hope to accomplish someday in his honor and therein for me lie the trick the humor the mystery the essence of who bruce wa this time with all the love he could muster and what surely could have only been the best intent he went out once again but this time he didn t come back this time he left the recovery to u but not before turning the light he sang for around and giving u all a quick glimpse of the richness of our own humanity in it glow and a lasting mental picture of what a roomful of good intent look like i realize that not everyone will view the moment of his departure through the same celebratory and even humorous lens a i but it is my intent that my word ring true in regard to who bruce wa is and that the love and appreciation i have tried to express for him and what he ha brought to my life speaks to some degree to anyone else who knew him in whatever capacity be it for a minute or a lifetime and that it brings some measure of assistance to the healing process but if my word still leave any doubt a to whether the manner in which bruce left wa right in line with who he really wa and something to celebrate rather than lament bruce s own word from a 1970 interview on the question what is grease say it better than any of u ever could anyway see our main ambition in life aside from growing a bosom on top of our head is to die on stage and when we die on stage that will be when we ultimately reach grease bruce i hope that in whatever greasy reach of the omniverse your travel take you your love light shine a brightly a it did here on earth we will all miss you and we all thank you sir for your service love fish
