Phishy LA (Westside) band needs bass player.,"Though we play mostly originals, we sit right in the phish zone of musical sensibility so my main prerequisite starting point for adding a band member is always ""gotta be a phish fan and gotta be a good player who is comfortable with one foot on a banana peel""
Here's an example of our sound

We're looking for someone who is a solid player, is into jamming and rehearsing enough to be solid and is into playing gigs around LA mostly.

Are tossed with thoughts into a bin
And time leaks out, my life leaks in.

"A Favorite of Mine - Manchester, NH - 10-26-2010","This show hit me in a very special place, and holds a special place in my heart.  It was the first and only time Phish played in my hometown.  The bust outs were phenomenal.  The crowd was UNBELIEVABLE.  Practically shouting every lyric back to the band.  I was fortunate enough to be on the floor for this rager.  Here's the necessary links for anyone interested.

Phish at the Dentist,"I was really impressed with my dentist today. I had to go in for one of my twice-a-year cleanings and I ended up being their only patient in the timeslot. The last time I was there, I talked about how I usually go see Phish a few times a year, so when I walked in today, they said ""We put your music on!""

They had Phish playing on the office speakers, just the generic Spotify Top Plays, I think. After some Bouncin' and Number Line and such, there was a good 10 minute or so Live Ghost in there. 

""Wow, this song is LONG"" she says, as I pretty much snicker, 'yeah, long for sure'.

Fast forward a few minutes and I tell them Phish actually has a song about the Dentist's office, I told them it was pretty weird and probably not the best to play, but they mentioned I was the only patient there, so they put it on.

The woman cleaning my teeth was laughing, the older Irish woman at the front desk was wondering why their phone was off the hook, and I'm pretty much laughing hysterically about the fact I got my Dentist's office to put on NO2, of all the songs in the world.

Can we all take a few minutes to appreciate the Walk Away outro?,"For most of my Phish career, I felt pretty neutral about Walk Away.  I always kind of lumped it in with the Type 1 rockers like Character Zero/Julius/etc, and never thought of it as anything special.  Just a cool high energy rock n roll cover with a good guitar solo at the end.  That all changed after seeing it in Hampton this past year.  

Driving home on Monday after that run, I replayed the Walk Away from N1 and was just blown away by Trey's solo at the end.  I ended up listening to that version multiple times per week for the past few months and can't seem to get enough of it.  I decided to learn the song on guitar this past weekend and try to learn/steal some of Trey's licks.  This led me down a deep Walk Away rabbit hole, and I thought some of you might be interested in what I learned. Hopefully this isn't all common knowledge already.

&amp;#x200B;

First, some history:

The song was originally written by Joe Walsh while he was still in James Gang and released on the album Thirds in 1971.  The song was a hit and Joe Walsh went on to perform it with the Eagles and solo for many years. The original version showcases Walsh's cranked Marshall sound and some fairly standard blues soloing.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1988, Phish covered it for the first time at ""Pete's Phabulous Phish Phest,"" featuring a strong vocal performance by a sexy young Page McConnell:  [https://relisten.net/phish/1988/07/23?source=117531](https://relisten.net/phish/1988/07/23?source=117531)

Phish's version stays pretty true to the original, with the exception of some minor additional parts added by the band.  The Joe Walsh version is in A major with A minor pentatonic blues melodies/solos.  The Phish version adds a C major &gt; D major climb a few times throughout the song, plus some nice double stop bends from Trey.  This addition doesn't really add much to the song at this point, but it is important in the evolution of the song.  All these early versions were fairly straight-ahead, and usually under 4 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

The cover was a regular staple throughout the late 80s/early 90s, including an appearance within the infamous Bomb Factory Tweezer in 1994: [https://relisten.net/phish/1994/05/07?source=118066](https://relisten.net/phish/1994/05/07?source=118066)

After that appearance, the cover was shelved for a few years.  

&amp;#x200B;

It reappeared in 1998 at the Greek Theatre (great show).  This version emerged from an out-there Reba and was jammed out for a few minutes before a smooth segue into Simple: [https://relisten.net/phish/1998/10/29?source=118439](https://relisten.net/phish/1998/10/29?source=118439)  

&amp;#x200B;

The song was played a few more times in 1.0 in its original form, with nothing remarkable about any of the versions I listened to.  The song was shelved again throughout 2.0.

&amp;#x200B;

When Phish returned from their second hiatus in 2009, the song was once again brought back into rotation (including its first 3.0 appearance and my very first show: Starlake 6/18/09, almost 10 years ago).  

&amp;#x200B;

In 2010, after over 50 total performances of the song, a new ""version"" of Walk Away was played on 6/17/2010.  Instead of doing the standard ending, Phish introduced a new outro chord progression.  The new progression was A &gt; Bm &gt; C &gt; D.  This climbing progression gives the jam an endless rising feeling and the borrowed C major gives the Am pentatonic soloing a different flavor.  From listening to this recording, it seems like the entire band jumped on the new progression right away, which makes me wonder if it was spontaneous or if someone came up with the progression during practice and they decided to keep it(If I ever get to meet Trey, I will ask him and see if he remembers):  [https://relisten.net/phish/2010/06/17?source=118709](https://relisten.net/phish/2010/06/17?source=118709)

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of how it came about, the band liked the new outro and decided to keep it.  Instead of the usual 3-4 minutes, the song was now regularly 6-7 minutes.  They performed it on a semi-regular basis throughout 3.0, and every version I've heard since then features that soaring outro solo, including this official release from 2010: [https://open.spotify.com/track/4oYwQPyB8Z14x6OoToRyVq?si=8DfdzH7qRJiF2JJFIjO3og](https://open.spotify.com/track/4oYwQPyB8Z14x6OoToRyVq?si=8DfdzH7qRJiF2JJFIjO3og)

&amp;#x200B;

This brings us to the Hampton 2018 version.  Its the best version of the song the band has ever performed (I'd love to be proven wrong!), and one of my favorite solos Trey has ever played: [https://relisten.net/phish/2018/10/19?source=129591](https://relisten.net/phish/2018/10/19?source=129591)

If you have access to the soundboard, I recommend that because this recording isn't the greatest.  The song starts out of Rift (with Trey making the last chord of Rift be the first A chord of Walk Away - nice one Trey).  Standard composed section, and then the outro: Page hammering away at the grand and bringing higher and higher octaves in on his organ, Fishman banging the shit out of his drums, while Trey shreds an absolutely face melting solo full of tasty unique and interesting licks intertwined with his signature licks and style.  The band built up the energy until it felt like the place was going to explode, and Trey throws in some Whammy bending towards the end to destabilize and increase tension, before bringing it home and ending the set.

&amp;#x200B;

Like most of you, I listen to Phish for the jams, but these explosive Type I solos are what originally got me into the band and makes Phish the rock n roll gods that they are.  

&amp;#x200B;

This ended up being a lot longer than I planned, so TLDR:

Phish added a new outro section to their cover of Joe Walsh's Walk Away in 2010.  I saw it again in Hampton last year and became obsessed with that outro solo, so I spent the entire afternoon yesterday studying the song and analyzing Trey's playing.  Listen to the 10/19/18 soundboard of Walk Away and have your face melted.

(Think background music as people mourn so no heavy hitting songs). 

I‚Äôm currently digging through ballads and would like to only use studio cuts since the funeral parlor may not be a good venue for live drawn out jams.  I‚Äôd love to find a studio-ish circus comes to town.

Pro-Tip for anyone who might be planning on purchasing, I am a Prime member and, I didn't plan it this way, but when I was ordering, the app was giving me the same day shipping option.

Both options are available to me? Bring it to me today!!!) Sure enough, package did not arrive. Called Amazon. First operator offered $5 credit. Given that (true story), delayed shipments happen to me *all* the time as a Prime Member, I asked to escalate it and the next up gave me a promo credit for $20.

Don't seem blown away yet...,"Ok, before I get crucified I'm not here to speak in any ill way about the band, cause in fact I think they are immensely talented, but quiet frankly I don't see the magic everyone else does. The reason I found phish is, well, the Grateful Dead. I've been dwelling into jam music for around a year now so I'm still fairly new, but I've already made my way through all the offical releases of the Dead, plus around 70% of all their live material available in spotify and countless shows from the archives. My point is, that I fell in love with the complexity of the jams, and how incredibly out there they went. I've been hooked since the first time I heard the ""Live/Dead"" Dark Star, like I had never heard something like it before and I kept having that same feeling thought so many of their jams, but with Phish I haven't felt like that a single time. Most of their live performances for me have fallen a bit flat, with their jams just not feeling like they go out there as much, or the patterns they stumble upon aren't as complex as many I've heard from the dead. Honestly though, I feel like I'm just looking in the wrong places, and was wondering if maybe anyone could point me in the direction of any jam or just show in general that will make me eat all my words? I have already heard ""A live one"" and ""Slip Stitch and Pass"" and wasn't impressed which are the ""beginner"" albums everyone seems to recommend me.

How did you get into Phish?,"My story: August of 2016, my college buddy asks me if I wanted to go to a concert on December 29th. I said ""sure, who?"" He said ""Phish."" I thought ""eh, I heard they're weird. Nah."" But I was drunk and said ""ok!"" So after my fleetingly-dumb decision, I started listening to Phish more to familiarize myself with them, and I started to catch on. Man, they were just so unique. I liked them for the time leading up to the show, but I hadn't caught the fever. Anyways, I went to the show. During set 1, I was like ""eh this is good but not great."" Then they closed that set with Cavern. And I was.....shook. Wrecked. Flooded with joy. I don't know what it was, but from that moment on, I wanted more. NEEDED more.

Hell is Coming,"Is anyone here old enough to remember ‚Äúimport CDs?‚Äù    

Long before the days when you could just stream any live Phish show you wanted (back when tape-trading was an art form), there was the ‚Äúimport CD‚Äù section of music stores. This is where you could find over-priced shitty bootleg recordings of random Phish shows on CD. These were a big deal to my teenage-self because CD burners were not yet household technology. Anyway, one day I found an ‚Äúimport‚Äù of a 1993 show (I can‚Äôt remember which one) that was titled ‚ÄúHell is Coming‚Äù on the front of the CD case. I was a noob to Phish and was intrigued that they opened the show with a song called ‚ÄúHell is Coming.‚Äù I was a little freaked out. It was a really quirky, upbeat, and funky song in which they repeated over and over: ‚ÄúHelllllll is coming. Helllllll is coming.‚Äù    
    
It took a few months and some embarrassment until I finally realized what it was.    
    
If you ever want to freak yourself out, take a bong hit and listen to Halley‚Äôs Comet with the alternative chorus.

3/18/97 Appreciation Thread,"I remember vividly when the 3/18/97 show was announced at the Flynn. It was such a tiny venue for PH and the instant buzz was undeniable. It was about a year after I had \*really\* gotten into them. I was in high school, and was pre stubhub etc, so there was literally no way to access the show even if I had the means. 

The next morning on Rec.music.phish (or Gadiel?), I saw the setlist- that was near the ultimate for me. I HAD to have that show.  Then the great Dean Budnick posted he would get anyone tapes of the show for a trade or B+P if he didn't want anything on our list. It was a crazy generous offer, and I remember getting my recordings from that show a few weeks post show, which at the time was unheard of fast. A far cry from couch tour and the instant sbd downloads we're not accustomed to.

I love the vibe of the show, the horns. What a great time in Phish, just having played the show that would become Slip Stitch and Pass a few weeks prior. They were en fuego!

We saw all kind of shooting stars and I just got right into that deep Halley's Comet groove. It meshed with the night sky and was perfect! Have been hooked since.

They should do a deconstructed Fluffhead set,"Before Fluffhead was a full composition, Phish used to play smaller sections of the song as standalone songs. They sound great as little instrumental interludes in a set. I think it would be awesome to see a Fluffhead opener, but then we get the sections of Fluff‚Äôs travels interspersed into the next two sets. To me, this would be way cooler than Gamehendge, and would fall into the echelon of sets like the Moby Dick set, or 6/22/94 or something.
 
8/29/87 at The Ranch is the best example I could find of a set list that contains Clod, Who do we do, and Bundle of Joy throughout 2/3 of the show.

Do you think they could tastefully do something like this?

Top 5 shows you've attended and why!,"Not just the setlist/jams, but the vibe, friends, set and setting, etc...

For a 3.0 kid like me --- 

5. 8/8/18, Camden 
The last show I got to see before leaving the country for a very long time, and so I often bask in this memory while I'm overseas. A lot of folks said night one was better, but I loved this one. Wingsuit, Scents, and Melt in the second set all blew me away, and I relisten to it often. Also just continually blowing me away how every time I see it, the better and better it gets. I was also fortunate enough to be there with my closest friends, including my little brother. 

4. 7/8/16, Mansfield
I've seen every show they've played here since the return, and heard a lot about this ""Great Woods curse"" that folks talk about... this show kindof cemented it, when they literally blew the PA system just as the second set Wolfman's was about to rip harder than it ever has. I haven't done my research, but I'd imagine this hasn't happened to the band since at least the early 90s, and it's no wonder they probably won't be back anytime soon... but I can't help but feel in my heart that it happened because the show was just too good to be true. The Light jam is one of the very best I've ever heard, ever - and the first set Cities was also equally monstrous. The other reasons though, is that I was attending with my girlfriend at the time, her first show that I had managed to talk her into, and they played Fast Enough For You - my alltime favorite Phish song that I've been hoping for ever since I started seeing the band. Truly special moment.

3. 10/26/10, Manchester
New Hampshire is my homestate, so when I saw this tour announcement I literally jumped for joy. I was in highschool at the time, and me and my best pal zipped right over after getting out of class. NH at the time (and kinda still) is a very unchill place when it comes to just about anything fun, but no one seemed to be giving a fuck about anything. It sure was a beautiful time sitting up on top of a parking garage, smoking a joint in a place that any other night we'd certainly be immediately arrested, watching the planes take off before walking into the venue. But goddamn, did that band play. Someone said it was their 1500th show that night, and it was a perfect night. The Light jam I think very much paved the way for great things yet to come, but my favorite moment was hearing Curtain With for the first time live - one of my favorite songs - and one of the most ethereal jams there is. Pure serenity. 

2. 11/28/09, Albany 
My first Phish show, and what a first show it was. My dad, who always supported my love for live music, got the tickets as an early Christmas present since he knew how badly I wanted to see the band, and drove us 4 hours to get there, and I'll never be able to thank him enough for this. But if anyone reading this happens to have been there, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. I think I've gotten really lucky with all the shows I've seen, but having this night of all nights as my first time seems pretty ridiculous. With the second set Seven Below&gt;Ghost clocking in at a combined 47 mins, this is still the longest combo I've seen, and it seemed pretty widespread belief through the community that this was the night that the band really ""came back"" after the hiatus. I wasn't really paying as much attention to that, as much as I was my own incredible happiness that such a band really exists, playing music for the sake of playing music, and having more fun up on a stage than just about anyone. 

1. 10/23/13, Glens Falls
For anyone there, you know what I mean. Seeing Phish play in a 4000 person venue is something that I'm sure I'll never get to experience again, stumbling into GA 5 hits deep to the opening chords of Back in the USSR being played for the first time since their Halloween show and the crowd literally blowing the roof off, the band playing a perfect setlist in every way with a little bit of everything they do best, an experience shared with my best friend in the world, who has since past away, seeing them jumping over the rail through the crowd as soon as Undermind hit - the song we had both been waiting to see together. Just a truly beautiful memory, and one that I'll cherish forever. It's honestly hard to find the words for this one, so I'll give up now.


Anyhow, if anyone here is so inclined, I'd love to read other experiences. I miss seeing these guys, and miss seeing y'all there, and it feels really good to reminisce -- since it'll be another two years until I can get my sorry ass to a show. 

So if anyone's got the time, I've got the inclination ;)

The end of Phish and tour life...It has been good...,"Well guys,

&amp;#x200B;

It has been fun. Touring, driving cross country in my 1989 4runner, flying cross country for endless shows. I loved it. Sure it wasn't the best for the planet environment (traveling 10's of thousands of miles per year via car and plane), but at the end of the day, we all loved the music and that energy is worth it to me.

&amp;#x200B;

But with the new ""Green Deal"", it looks like we will likely have Airline travel and Combustion Engines completely banned in the next 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/691997301/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-releases-green-new-deal-outline](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/691997301/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-releases-green-new-deal-outline)

&amp;#x200B;

Since we are ready to totally put fossil fuels out of business (which is 100% fine) we must be ready and willing to accept the consequences. Almost everything we use is made of petroleum at some point. The guitars, the amps, the internals of strings, the circuit boards... The machinery used to mine the metals, get the wood, make the pickups, all require oil to extract, synthesize, create and put together. There is no way Trey or the band can even play music without petroleum making all of this possible. I am okay with that, but it is REALLY going to suck losing the music industry (and every other industry) due to this. But we must push forward!

&amp;#x200B;

Just because oil makes up everything around us in one way or another (your computer, your shoes, your jacket, your toothbrush, your car tires, your entire car, your heating, your phone, your headphones, your home, your dog food bowl, your ski boots, your skis, your helmets, the new bike you bought, the PS4 and Xbox in your room, the new bluetooth speaker you bought, your lipstick, your pillows, your dishes, your cameras, the case your beer comes in, the plastic wrapping your cig pack, the plastic holding your legal weed in, your snowshoes, etc) doesn't mean we cannot make it. It just means we will have to change our lifestyle a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Together, we will have to carry on the legacy of tour and music in the new green age as something of a barbaric past. Something where it was a fun time, of debauchery and insanity, but at the end of the day, having Phish drive around 3-4 tractor trailers (using massive amounts of oil), while 10's of thousands of fans fly around in gas guzzling airlines and cars, to see music, just isn't something we can support for this globe. We all know this is true...

&amp;#x200B;

I know many of us will 100% stop driving and flying to concerts this summer. We will stay home on the couch made of synthetic fabrics (made from oil), while munching on organic quinoa and kale, upset that we can't drive to the store anymore, but hey, at least we have food rations from the Government. I'm sure the corn and GMO soy will make us all better people. But I have to say... the worst part of all this is that Phish doesn't even play in the USA anymore, since they're multi-millionaires. Give they are worth so much, they are the most mobile and they left the country to avoid a heavy tax on the 1% (since they are all in the 1%).

Usually it‚Äôs a dog who walks away the big winner from New York City‚Äôs Westminster Dog Show, but Nick Lachey has a way humans can win too. The 98 Degrees frontman has partnered with Purina Pro Plan for the $1 Million Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Bracket Challenge. To take part, all dog lovers have to do is fill out a bracket ‚Äî much like March Madness ‚Äî picking out which canines they think will be top dog in each of Westminster‚Äôs seven groups and the overall winner of Best in Show.

Is anyone good at arts and crafts? Looking for some help creating a custom hat.,"Hey everyone, 

For the Camden show my friend and I are staying on a houseboat in Philly for the weekend. To celebrate this, we would really like to make some captain's hats with a phish patch to wear for the shows. So ideally it would be like a hat in the picture below except with a doughnut or something where the anchor is. 

I was hoping I could get some advice about 3 things here:

1. I have never used patches before. Is it better to iron them on or to sow them on. 
2. Any recommendations for a cool patch, I've seen a few cool ones on Etsy but I'm still browsing. 
3. Would anyone be interested in making 2 of these hats and sending them to me. If you are, feel free to DM me and we can talk about price. 

Thanks!

"What a great time it is to be a Phish fan, folks.","I'm sure much of this has been talked about before, but I probably don't read/post online about Phish nearly as much as most of you. 
I just wanted to express some gratitude towards this awesome band and fanbase today. Phish lately seems like they are in the best place they've been since 2003 (some of you might argue '97, but I am an advocate of early 2.0). The shows are pretty much consistently above-average, with ""big jams"" of some sort almost every night. Each and every show contains elements of overall ""phishiness"" from every era. The band seems to have an increasingly large energy, since probably Summer 2015, that says that they aren't afraid to push boundaries, try new things, and break out of the box in new ways that they haven't had since the mid-late 90s. While at the same time, their jamming now blends together elements of all the styles they had tried throughout the years, to take their jamming to a place of *you never know what you're gonna get*. We seem to have moved out of the bliss-jams-only era of 3.0. Plus, the setlist construction seems to get increasingly better, and the newer songs that they're writing are getting better than the cheesy, dad-rock we had come to expect from 3.0. More than anything, the band seems like they're as happy as can be playing together and want to keep this going for as long as possible. What a great time it is to be a Phish fan. 
Can't wait for Mexico, I have a feeling this will be the best run there yet.

Reddit phanners - our Phish friend Dan (whiskaz on PT) has recently opted to enter hospice after a long battle with Stage IV Metastatic Melanoma.

Lots of phans are doing their best to provide help for him, his wife, and his son.

Any support or help spreading the word to other Phishy communities would be great.

To try to avoid the spam filter I'm going to provide the PT thread that has all of the information you will need instead of the direct link.

The Helping Phriendly Phantasy Baseball League,"Hey there sports fans! I made a fantasy baseball league for any of you guys who would like to join. 2 of my favorite things are phish and baseball, so why not try and create a league with some like minded folks!? Here is a link to the league.

Please invite others if you know anyone who would like to join. It might be hard for us to get players...

I'm open to making some changes in its format and maybe even making it a keeper league for future seasons. All I ask is that you use a sweet phish reference as your team name (I'm still thinking of mine) and please try to stay as involved as you can. (it's more fun when everyone competes!)

I'll be back in China tomorrow and will be unable to use reddit until the summer, so if you need to contact me on here, make it quick! Otherwise, hit me up in the league!

Phish gods bless me!,"So I went to MSG last night without a ticket as I have done the last three years. One year I got a crazy miracle as the amazing women say me with my finger up and ran up to me hugged me tight said HAPPY NEW YEAR gave me a ticket and ran away! I caught up to her tears coming out of my eyes and hugged her again and said thanks! 

Last year I got a last minute CoT ticket face value right next to my friends and boogied the night away in the ocean on this amazing soul planet.

So this year I went looking for a ticket finger up by the Chase ATM area if you've been there you know it. Finger up replying to CoT posts the second they come up with no results. Many of my friends pass me talk about where they are sitting go into the venue and I say I'll see you there cause I know I'm confident that I will get in. Another group of friends comes to me asking if I have a ticket yet and I say no, and one of my friends girlfriend says WAIT I HAVE A TICKET FOR YOU. Apparently a friend of hers already had a ticket somewhere else that she got from work even though she was in on the tickets in a different section. So she tells me I can use her friends ticket to get in. I was like great who should I pay who should I give money to for the ticket she just responds with don't worry its new years just smile. I was so thankful it was amazing. I just met her last night I was so thankful so happy gave her a big hug after the show and got to bring in the new year in space!

Some final thoughts/opinions about Phish 2018.,"Post-Bakers Dozen felt eerily similar to Post-Big Cypress ‚Äî where would we go from here? How could they possibly go up from here? Especially in 3.0, practice is paramount to good Phish, and with the band practicing 4 hours daily during the BD, it seemed like it would be difficult to get back to that level of playing and jamming. Indeed, Summer 2018 felt like they had perhaps lost a step from the previous summer. There were some moments/shows where that sparkle of brilliance broke through, but the shows (for the most part) weren‚Äôt complete, and the jamming wasn‚Äôt as fluid. When they got to Alpharetta, things finally seemed to take a turn. Nights 1-2 of Alpharetta were excellent top-to-bottom shows with big jamming, however after that the shows went to how they had been before Alpharetta - not bad by any standards, just not quite at 2017 levels. Curveball cancellation sucked, but I think possibly could have been a huge blessing in disguise. Dicks was a great run, but something changed in the 6 weeks between summer and fall tour. The Kasvot set not only got them practicing a lot, but reignited a flame that I think was missing in the summer. 

Fall tour, in my opinion, was the best tour in all of 3.0. Trey got some major chops back, and the spacey, sonar type II jam style that had been born in 2017 was improved upon and done more often. We saw the return of the long-form first set jams, and big second sets. This fall tour had more top-to-bottom complete shows than any I can remember since the return. I think the best shows of fall all rank amongst the best shows of 3.0. 

This fall and New Years run was a consistent reminder of how I felt in my early days of phish (1994-1998) when every show would be exciting. 

My vote for top shows, in order, is as follows:
1) 12-30-18 (MSG 3)
2) 11-02-18 (Vegas 3)
3) 10-19-18 (Hampton 1)
4) 12-29-18 (MSG 2)
5) 10-26-18 (Rosemont 1)
6) 08-31-18 (Dicks 1)

My vote for best jams of 2018:
1) Hampton Golden Age
2) MSG Split Open and Melt
3) MSG Everything‚Äôs Right
4) Vegas Split Open and Melt
5) Hampton Simple
6) Vegas Mercury
7) Rosemont Tweezer
8) Albany 20YL
9) MSG 7 Below (would be WAY higher if there weren‚Äôt woos, which completely killed the vibe of the jam)
10) MSG Disease
Honorable mention: Hampton Camel Walk

The magic of Phish,"Story time!

So, today, I put in my 2 weeks notice at work. It's been a long time coming, and something that I've wanted to do for some time now. Needless to say, the job was making me unhappy on a day to day basis. After I did it, I started having 2nd thoughts:

Did I do the right thing? Is this going to bite me in the ass? Am I screwing over people that I genuinely like? Etc.

It's not as if I have no plan going forward. I didn't do this without having my ducks in a row, so to speak. Regardless, I had an odd feeling walking out of work today (I put the notice in right before I left).

Rewind to the morning. I was listening to 12/30/18 earlier in the day. I generally have time to get 1 set of phish in before the real work starts. Today seemed like the perfect day to rock the first set from that night.

Fast-forward to me leaving work and getting in my car to drive home. Mindlessly, I hit play on the live phish app. It's become such a routine in my life that I don't even pay attention to what song is on or coming up, I just hit play when I get in my car. 

It just so happened that ""everything's right"" was at its opening chords. It wasn't until trey starting singing that I realized the insane synchronicity that was taking place:

""Time to get out, I've paid my dues...

""The long night's over and the sun's coming out... 

""Everything's right, so just hold tight... "" 

Here's the rest of the lyrics in you need them, very fitting for the situation: https://phish.net/song/everythings-right/lyrics

Sure, you can call this a coincidence, if you believe in that sort of thing (I personally don't, but that's a different conversation for a different time). I like to believe that it was God sending me a message through my favorite music. 

While it was happening, I had goosebumps all up and down my body. I felt so assured in that moment that I did, in fact, do the right thing, and that I'm going to be happier as a result. Hearing those lyrics was what I needed at that exact moment in time. When it ended, I officially felt at ease with my decision. 

I'm not 100% sure what the next chapter in my book will bring for me. But I am sure that everything's right, so I'm just holding tight.

Hope y'all enjoyed reading this. Love you guys, and I'll see ya in the summer!",phish,1546485526,NBAfanatic12,13,1,True,2019-01-02

Musician Father In-Law First Time Response,"Just introduced some live phish to my father in-law. He‚Äôs been a touring cover band musician for 20+ years and I always enjoy showing him music to get his take on it. 

I just busted out Phish for the first time, as I am a recent convert my self, and this is how the night just went.

First song, prefaced as the only one that I would show him, ‚Äúyou enjoy myself‚Äù SPAC 12 (probably poor choice but it was stuck in my head) 

     - asked ‚Äúwhen do they sing‚Äù and ‚Äúwow that was                 weird‚Äù 

He got up after it ended, said good night, and went to the bathroom. 

Except when he was done he came back out and sat next to me and said ‚ÄúI need more music‚Äù

I proceeded to show him Blaze On, Gin, and Mercury&gt;SANTOS from MSG 

He critiqued and ‚Äúhated‚Äù each song yet asked for more. 

I finally said I was done and turned the TV off. I started getting my water etc ready for bed when he comes up to me and says the following,

‚ÄúI think I figured it out. Phish is like a steady morphine drip. You don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre on it until you‚Äôre off it.‚Äù

He asked to play more but I had to cut it off due to crying babies and a pissed off wife ü§£

Guaranteed he asks for more tomorrow, suggestions on where to go from there? I like showing live concerts, so any suggestions from live phish or YouTube? 

Tl:dr father in-law listened to phish for first time. Hated it, until I turned it off, and now wants more. ",phish,1546752401,Frmthmind,34,1,True,2019-01-06
A beer vendor is confident Phish is coming back to MSG this summer,"Before I say this, please no I am not one to buy into rumors. But if I don‚Äôt share what the Madison Square Garden beer vendor told me tonight, when I returned to MSG for bull riding one week after NYE, I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôve failed us. 

So I‚Äôm buying a beer, as we do, at this PBR (bullriding)  event tonight and the arena is still fresh off the NYE run, which was great of course. So I approach a beer guy and, after buying a beer, ask, ‚ÄúSo hey, how‚Äôs we treat ya?‚Äù He says great ‚Äî they always say great, we‚Äôre great in their eyes. Then, unprompted, almost songs as he‚Äôs topping off my beer: ‚ÄúPhish is coming back this summmerrrrr.‚Äù I‚Äôm like huh?! He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYep, kinda like Baker‚Äôs Dozen but maybe longer.‚Äù I kinda laughed like, I know you‚Äôre joking. But my man was serious. He was confident. He believes this is happening. 

Now I don‚Äôt know how much stock you put in beer vendors at big stadiums, but the ones that have been there for years tend to get heads up about events that might affect their upcoming vacation time. So, take it for what you will! Probably won‚Äôt happen, but it probably will.

PSOTD #118: Weekapaug Groove,"Hello again and welcome back to my dumb list. Or for those of you who I met over NYE welcome to your first installment. I've been slacking the last month or so because of the holiday's and travel. I'd like to give a special thanks to those that let me stay with them and welcomed me into their group over NYE. Without you my trip wouldn't have been possible. After this week I have to take an official hiatus from PSOTD so I can get some of my life in order. Really I've just got to spend the hour a day I spend on this studying for this certification so I can get a better job. After that I'll be back. Anyway, here's what you came for: Weekapaug Groove.

Weekapaug Groove was first performed on [1988/07/23](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-23-1988-petes-phabulous-phish-phest-underhill-vt-usa.html) and is accredited to Phish proper. The song takes its name from the town of Weekapaug located in southwestern Rhode Island. According to an interview Mike gave on 1997/09/09 the lyrics are essentially meaningless. He said ""So we came back to Boston [from Weekapaug, after playing a gig there at a yacht club], and I guess we were in the van or the Voyager we used to drive in, and that song ‚ÄúOh What a Night‚Äù came on the radio. You know that one? That awful [Four Seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_\(band\)) song? We just constantly listened to songs and changed around the words as to what they might sound like. I always had a particularly hard time hearing lyrics anyway, so I always would sing a song on the radio, sing along with the wrong words. So the bridge of that song goes ‚ÄòOh I-I-I trying to something,‚Äô but I was singing it, ‚ÄòOh I-I-I trying to make a woman that you move,‚Äô which means nothing, 'sharing in a Weekapaug groove.‚Äô So we all just started singing that, as complete nonsense: ‚Äòtrying to make a woman that you move.‚Äô It never occurred to any of us that it had any meaning, ever. There was a period of time that we were singing it, and I used to just yell out the lyrics, between singing them I would just yell them out as if I was preaching them, just to sort of make it more ironic that they have no meaning."" This would be confirmed by Trey after the band played the song on [2004/08/10](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-10-2004-tweeter-center-mansfield-ma-usa.html) at Great Woods.You can hear the story as he tells it on the LivePhish soundboard of the show.

The main riff of Weekapaug came to fruition during the first of three Oh Kee Pa Ceremonies. The band played for 11 hours in Trey's riverside bungalow in Plainfield, Vermont. At the time the original riff was much slower than the Weekapaug we've come to know. Sometimes the song is still played slowly. We've discussed Mike's Groove pretty thoroughly at this point. Weekapaug is always the end of it. Because of it's placement the song usually has interesting teases sprinkled in. Past examples of this include Lion Sleeps Tonight, Have Mercy, Psycho Killer and Wipe Out. Today [we'll share in the groove](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X1uLoj5QPqrYtzxzp9Ui61Kbzk_Puwm7/view) from [1995/12/07](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-07-1995-niagara-falls-convention-center-niagara-falls-ny-usa.html?highlight=653). 

Statistics:            
Weekapaug Groove was played at 26.68% of live Phish shows.             
It was last played December 30, 2018, which was 1 shows ago.

What is your favourite atypical Phish song?,"By this I mean: not a jam vehicle, or a particular rarity you've been chasing, or something incredibly ""Phishy"".  I mean like a Phish song that doesn't get played too often, but that no one really covets hard, but is still a great song.  (I hope my description makes sense.)

I have two: Crowd Control, because I think the studio version is just bursting with energy and it's a fun song, and Sing Monica, partially because it's my daughter's favourite Phish song, but it's deliciously poppy and probably Tom Marshall's cleverest lyrics.

12/30&gt;12/29?,"In my opinion this is a yes. It‚Äôs almost like the battle of the same dates in 97.  I like 12/29/97 better but I respect those who say 12/30 is king. Both all time shows. As were the two that happened last weekend. 

Here‚Äôs my reasoning why 12/30 wins....

12/29 was awesome. An absolute stunner of a show. The energy from the crowd+the band is what made the whole night. The first set was killer. The energy just kept on adding up and the transitions were on point. I‚Äôm a huge sucker for the sloth so that was awesome and that 46 days&gt;cities was so smooth. Ya mar is always fun and that wolfmans party time was incredible. 

But I think the second set is a little overrated. Carini was short. When I hear an carini opening the second set I expect some fire. What we got was just average. The tweezer&gt;ddhvl&gt;tweezer was obviously the highlight but I think gets way too much credit. After relistening several times, I just haven‚Äôt ‚Äúgot‚Äù that jam. It has its moments I‚Äôll admit but nothing compared to tweezers of recent years. Although the crowd eruption during the second tweezer was ear piercing. An absolute ‚Äúhad to be there‚Äù moment. No Quarter&gt;2001 wasn‚Äôt out of the ordinary for me. It was my third time hearing. And in fact I got this same segue at Lockn 2016... first tube was all energy especially from trey. The set was fire. Straight fire. Mainly due to the flow, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve ever heard like other people are saying. 

12/30 on the other hand just had the upper edge for several reasons to me. 

Set 1 was mind blowing. Alumni&gt;letter isn‚Äôt something we get too often and I love it especially as an opener. The mikes song was the best of the year. Paug was one of the best I‚Äôve heard in years. No men‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt anything special but that Tube was very good especially with the Paug ending. And of course we can‚Äôt forget to mention Glide II and bliss. I was sort of expecting it due to treys bust outs on his solo tour but to have both of them in the same show, almost back to back is legendary. It‚Äôs not too often we get a phish original debut (even though I was there for end of session). 

Set 2 on paper doesn‚Äôt look all that great. Almost kind of a groan. But let me tell you, the jamming was A+. Everything‚Äôs Right had a CDT Camden 99 jam at the end. Just absolutely soaring at the end. I couldn‚Äôt help but keep saying holy shit as it was happening. Everything‚Äôs Right is starting to become a favorite of mine. Plasma was a pure funk pocket. Light was a jam and a half. But SOAM, let me tell you, was the way SOAM should be played. Dark and spacey. CK5 was working fucking magic during it too. Couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect.

Then the 4 song encore. After MPP I thought I was blessed for that encore but 12/30 was incredible. The perfect cap on the night (even though I‚Äôm not a big cavern guy). That show from top to bottom was almost perfect. Better than last years 12/30 in my opinion. 

All in all, both great shows and this is all just personal preference. Hope everyone enjoyed the shows. This run will go down as one of the greats!",phish,1546905142,phishmeat,18,1,True,2019-01-07
Full review of 2018 NYE run,"12/28/18: Fun, well executed. But something is off...

¬†¬†¬† Set 1: The boys come out feeling the energy the crowd immediately showed and they go to Outlive our Brains, and the crowd erupts (this would just be the first of many energetic responses to the bands song choice through the weekend). The tune was mostly in form, but got extended a few minutes (would turn out to be the longest extension to Kasvot songs played twice). Followed by martian monster and axilla just showed the excitement those 4 had to come out to play tonight. &gt;Free felt like a breather, damn (perfect placement) and the song had a nice peak to it as well. I love If I could so I‚Äôll check that box and take that in set 1 any day. Highlights thru the rest of the set include the meat (got real saucy at the end), Ghost (avg for song, but continued that dark fun theme from Meat). Personal opinion on the Maze and Walls: I thought they had great tension throughout and the peaks were nice, but I thought it was a little clunky coming out of the tension for that signature arms-to-the-sky feeling we all love [I‚Äôll get back to this later, see possum!]. Walls to me sounded a little rushed for the beginning composition and I feel like the band members (namely Trey) struggled a bit with the timing. BUT once he got his feet under him in the second half of the song MAN did he soar. An excellent peak out to end a first set, and overall, I thought the set really flowed together well.

Set 2: ¬†Set 2 was good not great. I think the gems in here (namely the Soul Free, Fuego (peak), Gin &amp; Possum) are good versions and the house was really rocking. As a person who doesn't necessarily love Soul Free, I though the band had really good direction. I love billy Breathes so I did enjoy grabbing Swept&gt;Steep, but in the 2 slot? After that jam? I felt conflicted haha. The energy picked back up with the kasvot tun ‚ÄúFinal hurrah‚Äù (which I am having a blast with these songs, they fit great with Phish‚Äôs setlists &amp; flow) and Fuego. I think this song is a little not my taste, but the jams are rocking! This peak especially I remember raging really hard for. Then.. a shade. I actually like this tune, but keep the energy flowing boys, felt like we just got going again. The Gin is beautiful, lots of layers and followed by a well executed peak. &amp; then the follow possum was roaring! [and the crowd goes nuts]. I think possum is becoming the new maze (or maybe just the better executed tune). The way they held the tension before roaring that release was really well done (also look at dicks possum from 17 and BD). 

The bouncing it seemed to me like Trey had a hard time with. Bouncing &amp; Slave was a good encore tho, the slave build especially was really well done I thought. I‚Äôd take those 2 to end a show on most nights, but the best of the encores for the run is yet to come‚Ä¶. Overall I think my biggest complaint about this one is the flow, but as I mentioned before, the gems in here will hold up and I will definitely relisten to a good amount of this show. Just a hair short of 4.0 for me, rating is a little low imo (currently 3.56, mine 3.7). I had a blast at this show (they're all super fun, right?), but it just wasn‚Äôt the hose.

*Note - Me being extremely tired during this show could have affected my opinion. Long day of travel &gt; 3 hours of dancing definitely wore me out 

--

12/29/18: Wow.. what a night

¬†¬†¬† Set 1: Highlights of the set include: everything from buried alive &gt; cities (followed by a nice breather) and the ya mar&gt;Wolfman's&gt;Party Time&gt;Wolfman's. [where's the love for Party TIme guys?] The buried alive was rocking followed by a in-and-out Blaze on (I thought this version was good, fishman pushed the band with good pace to a decent peak and included a a good funk/rhythm section). The Sloth. F**k yes! [NSFW]. I‚Äôve been waiting for this one (played only 5 times since I started seeing phish). The energy in the building was NUTS for this one. Me and my buddy were power rocking and just totally enthralled by the energy this classic tune brang to the Garden. I thought the 46 days was an especially good jam with a slinky segue into the cities. Trey working his magic with the Bm/D switches and the band all together was locked in after 46 Days started to liftoff. Next up, the Ya Mar. I love this goofy song and got a little plinko-ey just before coming to a smooth close. [although we first miscalled it for waves at the time - sorry people next to us, we‚Äôre scrubs]. Finally, the only thing that can compete with the 46&gt;Cities is this Wolfman‚Äôs&gt;Party time sequence. The wolfman's started strong and found really nice space in a minor key, followed by more exploration. The vocal jam was a ‚Äúmakeup call‚Äù IMO from Mansfield ‚Äò16 when the sound cut out (thanks boys) and was really cool INTERWEAVED with Party Time. Just the band again showing us that they‚Äôve been practicing and I thought they were just in tune the whole set - giving room for every band member to thrive in their moment. Also I‚Äôll note that the bands changes were clean and smooth all set (this theme will continue throughout the run). BUT I felt this was on 12/28 after set 1. Are the boys going to be able to keep the energy up for all 4 quarters?...


Set 2: Highlights of the set include: The whole dang thang. I have been caught a few times in just moments of this feeling. It‚Äôs awe and disbelief and appreciation for what this band can do - even though it is hard to describe, we all know what it is. (jam night, powder night, 12/30/16, 12/29&amp;30/18 are some of mine). That tweezer had me jaw to the floor when it came back (and with a strong extra 7 minutes). The carini finds a nice jam and peaks but is just cut a little short and shadowed by other monsters in this set. Namely, the tweezer is just an amazing jam with good diversity and I think the Kasvot song fits in there perfectly. When they brought it back you could just feel the entire Garden go nuts (similar the way disease came back from melt during the Dozen imo). Then the No quarter was a nice breather. Led Zeppelin felt like a breather, woah. I‚Äôll take that in the ballad slot every night. 2001&gt;First tube is a great ending [dare I say perfect?] to an Phish set, with the 2001 being slightly extended at the beginning and a longer set of peaks (first opinion, haven‚Äôt compared times thoroughly though). Let me note here again that the bands segues were really clean as they just slinked from one song to the next all set (and all night). *Note: I liked the woo section here, but I wish it stopped here. I feel like they were asking for it all weekend, lets just get back to stop-start jamming. But I digress...


Encore was good-not-great again. I love the ‚Äúmake every song you sing your favorite tune‚Äù lyric and it was appropriate for the night. Followed by the ‚Äúgreatest 4 minutes of rock and roll‚Äù, and absolutely stunning night of Phish was capped off. Overall, I thought tonight was a barn burner. Everyone was talking about 12/30 being THE night or 3rd night of the run being the best, but, let us not forget that Phish is the band of ultimate regret. And they‚Äôll make you pay for missing a ‚Äúsleeper night‚Äù. I‚Äôll hold off on making any sort of ‚Äò97 comparisons for now. But this show deserves being discussed for a long time.. As will the next..

12/30/18: Yee with little faith, the boys come back strong

¬†¬†¬† Set 1: ¬†This set just felt like the show from last night hadn‚Äôt stopped. The band came out with the energy to kill it and top yesterdays. The crowd went absolutely wild for Alumni/Jimmy Page. I didn‚Äôt even hear the hot dog day ref because everyone was belting the lyrics. Show #35 and still checking off some heavyweight boxes. That was a cool first for me. With Bliss and Billy Breathes, im 1 song away from seeing the entire album. Other highlights of the set include: The weekapaug-&gt;X&amp;P and the No man's&gt;‚ÄùWeekaTube‚Äù sequence. Mike‚Äôs kept the crowd movin and I think it‚Äôs got some good segments in there. Glide II was interesting to see (only time played) but definitely cooled the mood of a very exciting crowd. If I didn‚Äôt talk enough about clean segues already in my last review, we‚Äôll talk some more. This weekapaug&gt;X&amp;P is sweet af and totals for 20 mins of focused jamming. More clean segues and teases to come out of the no mans and honestly this no man's is nothing to skim over. Really gets into some really nice peaking feat. trills from Trey towards the end. then&gt; tube. Love this song. Then they start jamming the tube (f*n right!) Real smooth, easy listening on this echoplex based groove. Again feeling like they‚Äôve really pieced together an awesome selection for a Set 1. then holy shit are that weekapaug coming back from forever ago? Welcome to mashup weekend i guess! BUT when it went back into the blues breakdown of tube, that‚Äôs when the Garden erupted. This one was a woah, one of my favorite parts of the set (and honestly the show). Set 1 is the new Set 2?? Tonights was really hot. PS - Thank for for the bathroom break in More guys, I can‚Äôt stress enough how much that was needed. Back just in time for the numberline solo. 


Set 2: ¬†Highlights of the set include: Cool Amber all the way thru Light, and the Melt. The CAAM got a good 3 min (ish) extension and I thought it jammed really well. Everything's Right, a little down tempo but I also thought that song got into a good groove and goes for a solid 15. &gt;Plasma &gt;Light. The diversity of jamming during this 3 song sequence is really good. Trey really roars during this Light, I thought for sure this was going to be the set highlight with Everythings Right at a close second, but yee with little faith - there is more to come. After an appropriately placed Velvet Sea, Mike starts up the Melt bassline. *Cue crowd eruption* This jam might be the best of the run (This, tweez, &amp; -7 for me), it was just simply inappropriate with no regard for any well-being. It got nicely blissed out briefly before turning dissonant and dark with CK5 putting on a dang ‚Äòole clinic with those lights. A+ boys.


This encore might be the best I‚Äôve ever seen live. The entire arena was just went of control with the band popping off 4 awesome closers (which I think could have any of them could have stood alone in that slot just fine). The funky bitch was fun and the crowd was ready for a Wilson. I went to grab my flannel like twice (thinking surely it's over) after the funky bitch and wilson. But yee with little faith. Wow the energy in MSG for these songs was something special to be a part of. Then rocky top comes on and somehow it seems like people are raging even harder. *No reaching for my flannel this time - fuck my coat* Cavern starts up and here we go, one last dance (also I giggled at the faceplant into rock quote). They decided to end this one the right way. Another perfect ending to an absolutely amazing show. After a lot of relistening, I am currently holding this show slightly higher than the last. The diversity of jamming, more bust outs, the 3 set 2 monsters, and the 4 song encore are hard to compete with (but its still such a toss up). Dang ole Phish putting on a dang 'ole clinic man. The last 2 nights might be the strongest 1-2 punch in a very long time (so I'm not counting Powder-Jam or Magna, although, those are interesting conversations). Peak Phish ladies and gentlemen, everyone wins. I‚Äôll hold off on making any sort of ‚Äò97 comparisons for now. But this show like the last deserves being discussed for a long time.

12/31/18: A fitting cap to the run &amp; Fall 18

Set 1: ¬†Highlights of the set include: Steam&gt;Chalkdust and the Antelope. Honorable mention for the vocally harmonized section of Ass handed (lol classy, guys). First half of the set was good, very start the night off funky. Lawn boy comes up and might I mention what a nice shirt Page had on. The steam was good not great but had good direction then into chalkdust the crowd just went wild. I felt this one was especially energetic (behind stage looking out at the band/floor for this one) and they even tossed in a little second jam after finishing the CDT (is this becoming a trend? I like it). Honorable mention for Fish pushing the band to a quick peak (a la ‚Äò95) before What's the Use silences the building (in a good way). Then trey sings us to sleep with waste (see Coco monkey meme) which I thought was an okay breather. Did I mention that I really like the ¬†Kasvot songs? (See previous reviews) both stray dog and Play by Play I had a lot of fun with, and I think they fit great in the sets. Cap it off with a well executed antelope, no problem.


Set 2: ¬†Here is where the meat of the show really lies. Highlights of the set include: DwD, a confused look from Mike during Farmhouse, Seven Below and the Hood. All are worth a relisten, and even the twist was good but there was no time for more. I was utterly surprised with the Farmhouse call after a great disease (with good direction, which you can't say for all of em). But after that -7 the band tells me to shut up and keep quiet as they get really creative and deep on this track. This jam might be top 3 of the run for me. I'm usually a fan of woos, but this is the first time Ive considered it stale. I will agree with others that it killed the motif prior. But the band was asking for it. For now I'd rather hear a regular start stop jam. Honestly this twist is nothing special (it will be overlooked) but perfectly placed. The Hood I thought was really good (almost going to plinko land) then went into Passing Through. I‚Äôm torn on this, I like the tune (and the attempt to segue in and out) but I think it might've been better if they played them separately. They did end up coming back with a good finish to the Hood, which was magical (I forgot they hadn't ¬†finished at the time), but not super sold on this one. Hard to say, either way, the band was flexing their muscles with this one. Showing cohesiveness and good practice hours once again. Shiny gem of the set is definitely the -7 IMO with the DwD at a close second. This set gets a 4.1 from me &amp; would be much higher if the farmhouse just came after the seven below. 


Set 3: ¬†Highlights of the set include: Mercury &amp; SANTOS. Some really sweet licks from trey and Mike throughout the Mercury and it was just awesome to see the guys having so much fun with SANTOS. I think I was smiling this whole set. I loved the gag, the lights were great, streamers everywhere. Just super fun (and honestly that mercury jam will hold up). Watching mike and Trey fly through the air just having a blast. Watching mike air walk, the goofy balloon dancers. Space smells pretty damn good. The simple got ripcorded but one of my friends wisely said ‚ÄúSIA demands it‚Äù and it's pretty much on par for the course. It‚Äôll take a lot more than that to make me salty right now. SIA&gt;LxL&gt;R&amp;R&gt;Suzy were all great fun choices. The only two bad ripcords we really got all weekend was the farmhouse the and SIA, so count your wins! Also we got to witness another couple accounts of the fabled Bob Weaver!


After you play me Lizards, you can play whatever you want. Cliche or not, that was a rocking Zero. I‚Äôll keep this one brief because I wrote some lengthy ones prior, but all in all I just thought this was a great cap to 2018. And what a strong run. Fall tour has been so fun and energetic after the cancellation (thank you all for being amazing). Even the ‚Äúbad‚Äù shows were still awesome and have songs that have ‚Äúreplay value‚Äù. Eternal joy and never ending splendor. Keep adding more chapters to the book, pham.

This is ridiculous,"Ok guys so I have a bunch of phriends who love phish and I always used to be so confused as to why they loved them so much. They would see show after show, recommend 5 versions of the same song at once, I just wrote it off as - petty  adolescent phase (like those people in high school who just would never stop talking about the Grateful Dead, but didn‚Äôt really know a thing about them).

Then it happened. 12/31/18. My first Phish show.

Now I had listened to phish very casually for months before hand just trying to see what the big deal was and I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. I never thought they were bad, in fact, I could recognize they were amazing musicians with amazing chemistry. But still could not understand the obsession.

We won the ticket lottery, so we had very good seats just off the left side of stage, I could practically smell Mike as he walked on stage.

The band walked out, joints were getting lit, doses were getting eaten, and an absolute unmistakable atmosphere of love was in the air. I could feel the energy of the crowd pulsing through my system. It was remarkable.

But then, oh boy and then. That first lovely groove came out. It ironically enough was the first Phish song I had ever heard a few years before, the unmistakable groove of the MOMA Dance.

I started bobbing my head, I couldn‚Äôt control it. What was happening? It‚Äôs not stopping. I‚Äôm starting to dance? I don‚Äôt dance. ‚ÄúWhat is going on right now?‚Äù I thought. 

Before I know it I was feeling my beers and the little bit of blow we had been keying in the bathroom beforehand. And I was JAMMING!

Chalk dust came on and I was going insane, moving and grooving in ways I would never do if not in the company of all of you lovely judgement free Phans.

As my crew and I met up with all of our phriends after set 1 I couldn‚Äôt stop asking what the names of songs were, asking why they hadn‚Äôt brought me here sooner.

DWD &gt; Farmhouse was magical, I was at utter peace with myself. This band has me dancing and sweating one minute, and the next reflecting on life and wondering if I‚Äôm going to cry.

Then Mercury &gt; ALS &gt; S.A.N.T.O.S.!!! I had NEVER felt more alive. 

This band has consumed my life in this past week, everyday I listen to my show, I listen to Phish almost 24/7. Driving? Phish. Working? Phish. Playing video games? Phish. With friends? Phish. Sitting around doing nothing? Phish.

I love this community and can‚Äôt wait to see what this amazing band has in store for me. Thank you for reading and I hope to see some of you at a show!!!",phish,1546931631,Jeremy1556,59,1,True,2019-01-08

PSOTD# 119: Bliss,"Before we begin I'd like to thank Annie for doing a quick design for my stupid shirt idea. I took the time to figure out one of those print to order websites and listed it [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/673219921/hello-my-name-is-weekapaug-groove-shirt?ref=shop_home_active_1). I am not making any money off this (in fact, I've lost 40 cents so far). I didn't do the design and am not printing the shirt or anything so if you do order one all your money is going to Printful and ETSY. I also cannot attest to the quality of said shirt. I sometimes have half decent Phish based clothing ideas and now I know how I can get them done for myself. Next up is figuring out how to get a 90's Pacers #31 Jersey with the last name Wallob on the back without bending over for the NBA store. Anyway, here's Bliss.

Bliss is an instrumental track on Billy Breathes. It actually appears directly before the song Billy Breathes on the album. It debuted on [2018/12/30](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-30-2018-madison-square-garden-new-york-ny-usa.html?highlight=741) and is attributed to Trey. The song would go unperformed from the release of Billy Breathes (October 1996) until Trey's 2018 Winter Acoustic Tour ([2018/12/10](https://phish.net/setlists/trey-anastasio-december-10-2018-silva-concert-hall-hult-center-for-the-performing-arts-eugene-or-usa.html?highlight=741)). The song features an arpeggiated build that lasts just a few minutes. Fans first heard of Bliss when Trey sent a tape of the song to Kevin Cecil. In the summer of 1995 Kevin Cecil was walking a friend home and someone shot him in the neck, leaving him a quadriplegic. When Trey found out he sent him an advance copy of the song. He invited Kevin to be a guest of the band at the [1995/12/01](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-01-1995-hersheypark-arena-hershey-pa-usa.html) show. Because Trey had let an advance copy of the track release some fans on the internet knew there was a new instrumental out there. As a result some early setlists from fall 1995 confused Cars Trucks and Buses (PSTOD #20) for Bliss. Obviously there's only one live (Phish) version of the song for us to check out and [we'll do just that](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17QKPWis0IJLBeKKt-_FYva2hk7Rlsw7e/view).

Statistics:                    
Bliss was played at 0.06% of live Phish shows.               
It was last played December 30, 2018, which was 1 shows ago.                
There have been 1 shows since the live debut.

Us Gen Z phans are stoked for bonnaroo,"Seeing the lineup today my jaw hit the floor. Not just because there are some solid solid acts that I'll love, but also because there are some great acts that, while not my cup of tea, my friends psyched for. I'm hyped to see phish, jrad, hozier, Mac Demarco, etc, but it's important to recognize that acts like Childish Gambino and Odeza are highly respectable among more modern fans. Again, like I assume most of you, not my cup of tea, but you should still be able to appreciate the artistic merit of them. They're not a low effort personality like Cardi B (yeah, that one's an L).

The point being, there's merit in connecting fans from two seemingly opposite sides of the spectrum (hip hop and jam). Each get to be excited and enjoy their favorites, but also be exposed to new stuff, and at best learn they love the sound or at worst get a greater appreciation for a different style of music.

Is bonnaroo filled with an epic line up of jam? No. But I think it's something much greater than that, a balance. If you exclusively want a weekend full of jams, then we are lucky to have those available to us, and conversely for hip hop or edm, but Banaroo is offering something different with a high potential for greatness, and I for one am excited to share the Phish experience with those who would never otherwise.",phish,1546970253,RedditForTheBetter,33,1,True,2019-01-08

About 5 seconds after it started, someone next to me said ""... This is Phish"" and I listened and instantly knew he was right. There's no mistaking their sound, I would know it anywhere. We listened, and it sounded like a new song was going on every 45 seconds. Abruptly, almost like when you're flipping through a radio. And I thought I heard part of a radiohead song, and a dispatch song, and a red hot chilli peppers song. All bands who also played Bonnaroo! What I think happened was Phish went backstage, picked up instruments, and played clips of everyone else's songs who were at Bonnaroo with them. Then came back on stage and finished the show. I told some phriends this hypothesis and they think I'm crazy, but I know what I heard. There's not a doubt in my kind it was them.

It was the bestest most greatest moment EVER and for many reasons became kind of a pivotal moment for me in my life. I'd been going through some stuff, but I changed that day. So now I look back and kind of wish I had a memento. 

Long shot but would anyone be willing to part with their hotdog squishy? I can trade a raindrop squishy if you like! And will forever buy your drinks at whatever shows we both wind up at of course.",phish,1547054000,mellidee,4,1,True,2019-01-09

For Those Asking Where to Stay at Alpine," 

They shut camping on the grounds after a GD show in 85? 86? when their fans were disrespectful to the surrounding farms and homes and camped out in yards, break ins, open drug use, etc. It's an extremely conservative county and they had enough.

Two summers ago Alpine opened up camping on the grounds during a DMB show as a ""test run"" to see how it went. My husband and I camped there, and although it was Chad Central, and run a lot like any other festival (wristbands, etc.) I think Alpine and the local Sheriff were very happy with how it went.

So, I wouldn't be surprised if they later announce camping passes for purchase. I know the local municipality drug it's feet in approving it for DMB, so while I don't necessarily think it will happen, it is a possibility. It wouldn't hurt to contact the venue and show interest.

Take the entire 20 minute song and immediantly replay. This is so fucking good how was it possible that I haven't heard it especially considering I went to 12 shows in 2018.

PSOTD #120: Waves,"Waves was brought into this world on [2002/12/31](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-31-2002-madison-square-garden-new-york-ny-usa.html) and is accredited to Trey and Tom. The second is usually a second set joint. It has only been performed in the first set five times. The last first set performance was in 2004.

Waves blends sound and words to convey the feeling of have emotion wash over you. This can take a persons breath away or cause them to become deflated. This is the case for the narrator in Waves. The over riding theme is the power an unnamed female on the narrator with her words. The speaker thinks about the way the words reach his ears and measures the force that the have on him. While thinking about what to say back to the woman a twinge of pain overcomes him when he realizes that his words may not even reach his intended target. He visualizes his words as physical objects and thinks it would be nice if the female could see them as they traveled past her.

After it's debut waves would go on to played another 4 times during 2003's 12 night winter tour. The Waves would continue to roll in for the summer of 2003 with another 6. 2004 would see three performances of the song with the [2004/06/20](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-20-2004-saratoga-performing-arts-center-saratoga-springs-ny-usa.html?highlight=651) SPAC performance being [the most notable](https://phish.in/2004-06-20/waves). 2009 would bring Waves to use 3 times. The song did not get played for all of 2010. After a 78 show gap Waves returned with a strong performance on [2011/05/27](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-may-27-2011-bethel-woods-center-for-the-arts-bethel-ny-usa.html). It actually wouldn't even be the best performance of the song that weekend. Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro shared a version of Waves from the soundcheck the night before. It was a 30-minute behemoth that touched on John Coltrane and vintage Pink Floyd. After 2011 the song began to swell again. The boys have been playing the song 3-5 times a year since then. Today we'll [attempt to stay up right](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lVK52fPNVPjGRsSaNvFGX_Uy-6dDvx4S/view) while listening to the cascading ambient jam from the [2003/08/02](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-02-2003-loring-commerce-centre-limestone-me-usa.html?highlight=651) performance.

Statistics              
Waves was played at 2.36% of live Phish shows.

Can't Wait!,I'm so exited about these tour dates. Can't wait to see everyone. Im so happy I took on a second job back in November. I kept thinking to my self why am I killing my self working all these hours. Well Phish that why! It finally is paying off as my account is nice and full and ready to be blow on a large amount of tickets. I don't gamble and a relative gave me and my significant other 2 nights at Mohegan for Christmas this year. We we're just looking into trading them or selling them. But not anymore as this will cover our room. It's all very serendipitous the way it's coming together.  Just a couple more months and it's time to rage. It's also my birthday in July. So I'll see my Pham at Bangor then we are passing over NJ and will be at SPAC then we will be having my birthday party a little early for Fenway since we live 20 mins from the park and have a few people staying over for it. Then it will be off to Mohegan. Well also be at Dead &amp; Company on June 22 at Gillette stadium. ,phish,1547157549,BDH420,3,1,True,2019-01-10

PSOTD #110: Mike's Song,"Well another week is beginning and what a fun one it should be. I've been kind of drifting aimlessly in the themeing of these emails for a little so I figured it's time we got a little structure. I'd like to welcome you all to Mike's Week (or ten days, or however long I feel like I can stretch this out for). We're going to start with Mike's Song and end with Weekapaug Groove. All the songs in the middle will be versions that were, in fact, played in between the two songs. Should be fun. Let's begin.

Mike's Song debuted on [1985/03/16](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-march-16-1985-doolins-burlington-vt-usa.html) and (clearly) is written and sung by Mike Gordon. Mike's Song debuted with no name. The band called it Microdot or Mike Wrote That for a bit before simply referring to it as Mike's Song. The song tells a brief story of a trip Mike took where he learned a lot about himself.

For the first years of its existence the song was played on it's own and would occasionally springboard into other improvisational Phish tunes. Early versions were melodic with the first darker versions appearing in 1987, dissonance didn't really show up until 1989. In the summer of 1988 Mike's Song began to be routinely played as the first song in a trio of songs- Mike's Song&gt;I Am Hydrogen&gt;Weekapaug Groove- this would come to be known as Mike's Groove. While Mike's Song does appear solo sometimes it is incredibly rare. Mike's Song is always performed before Weekapaug.

In its early form Mike's Song had an opening composed section that launches into a jam but the jam would end with another composed section that was led off by Page. Check out [1987/08/29](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-29-1987-the-ranch-south-burlington-vt-usa.html) for [an example of this](https://relisten.net/phish/1987/08/29/mikes-song-2?source=119045). In early 1989 some chords were added to the beginning of the concluding composed section of the song. These chords would be used to mark the transition between the first jam segment (the tramps segment) and the second jam segment. These tramps segment closing chords typically proceed Trey's playing of the first note of Simple. Trey was playing these notes in this spot even before Simple was composed in 1994. In order to hear this we'll compare [1988/12/10](https://phish.in/1988-12-10/mikes-song) (which has the single jam segment that ends with the original closing chords only) with [2003/07/31](https://phish.in/2003-07-31/mikes-song) (which has a single jam segment that concludes first with the tramps segment and then is immediately followed by the original closing chords rather than a second jam segment) and [1996/12/06](https://phish.in/1996-12-06/mikes-song) (which has one jam segment that ends with the tramps segment before jumping into another song, in this case Simple). The second jam segment of Mike's Song died out on [2000/07/14](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-14-2000-polaris-amphitheater-columbus-oh-usa.html) and would not return until [2015/08/04](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-04-2015-ascend-amphitheater-nashville-tn-usa.html) when Mockingbird Foundation Board member Andrew Hitz spoke with Trey about bringing it back. You can read his account of the incident in [this](http://phish.net/blog/1439895466/behind-the-music-mikes-songs-second-jam.html) blog post.

From 1989 to 1994 Mike's Song contained a dark, sinister and semi-dissonant jam. In the early-to-mid 90's Mike and Trey often performed this jam while jumping on trampolines. This is where the name tramps segment comes from. [Here's some video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7GFMRPIsVY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=180) of it from [1992/03/31](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-march-31-1992-the-blue-note-columbia-mo-usa.html?highlight=381). Up until 1993 Mike's Song was usually followed by I Am Hydrogen. 1994 saw the creation of Simple and that would routinely take the place of Hydrogen. Over the years many songs would take the spot in between Mike's Song and Weekapaug and that's what we're going to explore this week (and maybe even next week too). If you're wanting to take a deep dive into Phish's growth as musicians there's no better way to do it than to check out the various Mike's Song's throughout the years. There's simply too many versions for me to begin to list. If you want a springboard, go ahead and [check out the jam chart](http://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mikes-song).

Well, I just wrapped up my touring gig (musical theatre, props department), and vowed to take a year off, and see these magnificent musicians as much as I can (and other things)!

Maybe they need a touring props guy this season?!  One can dream...

PSOTD #111: If I Could,"If I Could was first performed on [1994/04/04](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-april-04-1994-the-flynn-theatre-burlington-vt-usa.html) and debuted alongside Scent of a Mule, Down With Disease, Julius and Wolfman's Brother. It is written and sung by Trey. He wrote it for his good friend Amy Skelton when she was feeling blue about a recent break up. The lyrics reflect a desire to escape from the realities of life and day-to-day pain. In the song he takes them both away from worldly concerns while the two of them run over oceans, float through the clouds and move through space and time.  The lyrics were written from Trey's voice alone but the album (Hoist) version uses females vocals in the second verse. This creates a wonderful call and response that takes the listener on a journey of innocence, joy and empathy.

If I Could provided some emotional expression for the band that wasn't easily found in their catalogue as it existed in the mid 90's. It was in heavy rotation from it's debut in 1994 until the end of 1995. From there it would become a rarity with fewer than a dozen performances over the next twenty years. 2009 saw two performances of the song then it went back into hibernation until 2012 where it was played four times. Since then it's been played twice, once in 2014 and once in 2018. About 2/3 of the performances are in the first set. From 2009-2012 If I Could was performed by Trey with orchestral backing. Video of the 2009/09/12 performance with the New York Philharmonic can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqtH4FYRfpo#action=share).

Most popular Phish songs have a quintessential live performance and I find that this is untrue of If I Could. The album version features 27 time Grammy winner [Allison Krauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Krauss). She's tied for the second most Grammy's of all time with Quincy Jones. That version can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EuQLew0q0Oh1G3AkGDZYWY90N5V-Dqvq/view).

PSOTD #112: Simple,"Today we'll move right along in Mike's Week with Simple. Simple debuted on [1994/05/27](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-may-27-1994-warfield-theatre-san-francisco-ca-usa.html). It is written by Mike and sung by the whole band. Simple was originally recorded by Mike on a four-track tape recorder in the Doo-wop style. He would introduce it to the band during the studio sessions for Hoist. This version was in the bluegrass writing style of many previous Gordon songs. Ultimately the song would be left off the album. Lyrically the song talks about how the guys have it simple because they've got a band, the various instruments in the band and the various sounds those instruments make. And skyscrapers.

On its debut night the song was played in a very raw fashion (you can check it out [here](https://phish.in/1994-05-27/simple)). It would get shored up by the time it was played again on [1994/06/17](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-17-1994-eagles-ballroom-milwaukee-wi-usa.html), which is the same night as the low speed OJ chase. The band humorously remarked ""We've got OJ, cause we've got a band"". The whole show is filled with ridiculous references to the OJ chase because the band was able to catch part of it during set break. If this is something that interests you click [here](https://phish.in/1994-06-17) and give it a whirl.

The song hasn't left the bands arsenal since it debuted. In 1994 and 1995 the song was rarely used as an exploratory jam vehicle. The fall of 1996 is when the song really began to take off. During this time several long and interesting jams came to fruition as Page would lead the jam. Trey would provide percussion on the mini-drum kit he was using at the time before picking up his guitar and joining in on lead. 1996 set the tone for modern Simple jams with all four band members taking the high energy theme of the song to new heights.

From 1994 until 2000 Simple was easy to spot, just look for Mike's Song and more often than not Simple would be just around the corner. It progresses naturally out of the tramps segment of Mike's Song after all. This would lead to many fans shaking their heads and asking ""What happened to Hydrogen?"" In 2003/2004 Simple was played exclusively outside of Mike's Song. From 2009 onward we've got a happy mix of Simple with Mike's or the song flying solo. Today we're going to [keep it simple](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ka1kkcCcoDqJH_OFPjy9oVCKmnXq3twS/view) with the [1996/12/06](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-06-1996-the-aladdin-theatre-las-vegas-nv-usa.html?highlight=508) version. It was part of a monumental 57 minute Mike's Groove that went Mike's Song&gt;Simple&gt;Harry Hood&gt;Weekapaug Groove. What more could you want really?

PSOTD #113: Buffalo Bill,"Like Simple and If I Could today's song was written during the Hoist sessions. Unlike Simple, this song actually made it onto Hoist, kind of. Riker's Mailbox is a half-backwards, half-forwards chunk of the unused long take of Buffalo Bill. The band apparently recorded a long and bizarre version of the song but ultimately decided to cut it for, of all things, being too wacky. Instead it was altered into Riker's Mailbox and tracked after If I Could.

Buffalo Bill was first performed as an encore on [1992/11/21](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-november-21-1992-pritchard-gym-sb-sports-complex-suny-stony-brook-stony-brook-ny-usa.html). It is written by Tom and Trey and sung by Trey with Page and Mike providing backing vocals. If anyone has any idea what this song is about please enlighten me. Near as I can tell it's about a young man trying to de-escalate an awkward situation and feeling as if he did it well. He then leaves the person he was talking to only to be found later tied to a log, bent over and buffalo billed (which I would assume is a less than ideal scenario to find oneself in). Some guy on the Phish.net forums claims that Tom Marshall wrote it about a boss he hated and I can maybe see that being the case. The song usually runs about two minutes and it's kind of folksy yet bouncy.

Buffalo Bill is a rarity with 19 performances to date. 8 of those performances were from 1992-2000. Another 3 would come between 2003 and 2004. The song would be seen 8 times between 2010 and right now. It's got 7 first set appearances, 8 second and 1 third set appearance(s) and 3 encore performances. There were 225 shows in between the first performance and the second (1992-1993) and 204 shows between the third and fourth performance (1994-1997 at IT). It's shown up in the middle of Mike's Groove exactly one time and that was on [1994/12/31](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-31-1994-boston-garden-boston-ma-usa.html?highlight=93). [If you're looking for owls, we've got them right here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N6usvKS68L-ZCGA9UufoR5a5vweUJBO9/view) For those wondering the Mike's Groove of the night went Mike's Song&gt;Buffalo Bill&gt;Mike's Song&gt;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav, Weekapaug Groove.

"Best LivePhish+ ""exclusives""","After using spotify for a long time I recently subscribed to LivePhish+ and I'm trying to find the best stuff on here. I've seen a lot of the complaints about the service and one that I've noticed almost immediately is the interface/browsing. There's tons of good stuff on here but it's hard to filter, there's no themed playlists, 'best ofs' for certain time periods, or anything like that. The ""popular"" section is out of wack too because whatever algorithm they use ends up just putting whatever was released most recently as the most ""popular"".

There was another thread a week or two ago asking a similar question, but frustratingly, literally all of the top answers in there were things that are already available on Spotify (island tour, fukuoka, darien 2000, portland 98, the roxy, dayton, etc). So what I'd like to do here is maybe create some sort of master list or reference for other people who might be wondering the same thing. Any responses on this thread, I'll cross reference with Spotify and perhaps any other free streaming services out there, and then make a new post with all of the true best LivePhish+ ""exclusives"", and I'll probably include whatever the original poster says they like about the show too in their comment. 

Sooooo that being said. Best shows on LivePhish+ that are not on Spotify? I'd also welcome anyone sharing any playlists they made on it too, if that's even possible. ",phish,1544219165,steelburner123,4,1,True,2018-12-07

PSOTD #114: Steep/Swept Away,"Swept Away and it's companion piece Steep both debuted on [1996/10/16](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-october-16-1996-olympic-center-lake-placid-ny-usa.html). Swept away is credit to Tom and Trey where as Steep is credited to Phish and Tom Marshall. The two songs are always played one after the other with Swept Away coming first. The tandem was never played live before the release of Billy Breaths. Swept Away touches on the common Tom Marshall theme of the desire to live life free from the constraints of social conventions and pressure. Swept Away is melodic with three part harmonies that slowly melt into Steep.

In early 1996 Phish went into the studio in Woodstock, NY to record a follow-up to Hoist. In an attempt to move away from the studio sheen of Hoist the band created a layered, dense, improvisational swirl of music that would become known as ""The Blob"". Eventually ""The Blob"" was rejected for being too unfocused and meandering but a small part of the project remained in Steep. Swept Away is gentle and lifting, whereas Steep is kind of creepy. It jerks along at a stop-and-start pace before ending with a tidal rush.

The two songs were frequently used as a second-set breather in the fall of 1996 and spring of 1997 before being swept into the ether. Since 1998 the songs have been performed 8 times. The tandem have been in the middle of Mike's Groove 4 times. We'll go ahead and check out [1996/11/06](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-november-06-1996-knoxville-civic-coliseum-knoxville-tn-usa.html?highlight=551) where it was a straight forward Mike's Song&gt;[Swept Away](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e8dKG903LFiHwglO72LOVIxIUY1hLipt/view)&gt;[Steep](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5u9tP4PQnmvp80r5DeJzbd6Ej9xKbKQ/view)&gt;Weekapaug Groove.

Swept Away/Steep was played at 1.65% of live Phish shows.          
It was last played August 1, 2017, which was 46 shows ago.         
There have been 757 shows since the live debut.

PSOTD #115: No Quarter,"No Quarter was first performed on [2011/06/01](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-01-2011-pnc-bank-arts-center-holmdel-nj-usa.html). It is written by John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant and released in 1973 on the Led Zeppelin album Houses of the Holy. The song takes its name from the military practice of showing no mercy to a vanquished opponent. It's told form the perspective of a Viking widow waiting in the winds of Thor for word about the [Battle of Stamford Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stamford_Bridge). It represents the eulogy for the vanquished Vikings who struck oar on the western shores during Immigrant Song. The 24 boatloads of Vikings that remained at the end of their solo attempt to rape and pillage the North of England. While the Viking warriors certainly never gave or asked for quarter, they were shown mercy none the less.

The song was recorded in 1971 during the Headley Grange sessions for Led Zeppelin IV. The Headley Grange version has a quicker pace. In 1972 the song was recorded again with a more somber and dark tone. This is the version that would be included on Houses of the Holy. The song was captured on video for the concert film The Song Remains the Same. It was recorded during a three night Zeppelin MSG run on 1973/07/27-29. [Here's some video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW3xDZrlBQs) of that performance.

Phish would debut the song nearly 38 years later in Holmdel, New Jersey. This continued on the Tweezeppelin medley they had performed on [2010/10/30](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-october-30-2010-boardwalk-hall-atlantic-city-nj-usa.html) during the Halloween Run in Atlantic City. The guy who wrote the phish.net article about the song has some hilarious extrapolations about why Phish got the Led out in Holmdel. If you're so inclined, follow the history link below and check it out. No Quarter has been in the middle of Mike's Groove twice and today we'll be sampling the [2012/09/01](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-september-01-2012-dicks-sporting-goods-park-commerce-city-co-usa.html?highlight=1353) version from Dick's.

[Here's some video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz-GfRj_LfQ) from the onslaught in case some of you want to take a trip down memory lane. I'd also like to give an honorable mention to the most recent performance on [2018/10/28](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-october-28-2018-allstate-arena-rosemont-il-usa.html?highlight=1353) which I think is the bands best attempt at the song to date.

Statistics:           
No Quarter was played at 0.72% of live Phish shows.              
It was last played October 28, 2018, which was 4 shows ago.

Page McConnell not yet present, and includes extra guitarist Jeff Holdsworth, and Marc Daubert on percussion with Fishman. 

For me, the guitar playing and jamming and hamming it up in the show just exemplifies the fun, musical creativity of this band.

Trey solo shows...underwhelming?,"I love Trey as much as the next guy (25+yrs blah blah) but I felt like sung alone, the songs just seemed pretty flat and mildly boring, especially lyrically. Other than ""Miss You"" and maybe ""Strange Design"" I felt like there were a dozen unknown songwriters in my city singing more meaningful (and musically interesting) songs at that very moment. I've always been very content with Phish's silly, random lyrics but in that setting they kinda seemed extra dumb. (Back them up with kick-ass phunk and of course they fall right into place.) I think most folks at the show were pretty happy with it - and in spite of my judgment I still loved seeing Trey and getting to hear at least one great story. Anyway I haven't heard much chatter about these solo shows so I thought I'd venture an opinion and find out how many people agree and/or hate me. Party on!

The Floor,"A pretty neat Umphrey's song. 
A terrible place for a Phish show. I went to Vegas nights 3 &amp; 4 and was (I thought) fortunate enough to score a floor ticket for night 3. What I experienced was some of the most shameful and embarrassing displays of entitlement I have ever witnessed, and this is coming from someone who grew up male, middle class, and white. Worst of all may have been the territorial display I witnessed coming from some members of the Phellowship (of which I am a member myself) -- folks who boast of having and practicing spiritual principles, such as acceptance, in their lives. Their behavior was not a good look for the Phellowship. In a general sense, not only were a large number of fans on the floor territorial, as if in some truly meaningful and life affecting turf war, many were downright hurtful and violent (I saw significant verbal abuse and even a bit of violent, physical interactions). I know there is the big debate on claiming space, but at the end of the day this behavior and mentality has no place at an event such as a Phish show. Fortunately, I was able to find a spot with a few friendly and peaceable fans and did not let the handful of rude, sad humans ruin the experience. Those kind of folks can make what should be a joyous occasion legitimately uncomfortable for others, And that is unacceptable.  These are just observations coupled with my opinion.

Jah Roy?!?,"Jah Roy?!?

This is Phish related, even though the story is a bit long winded. I would love to get some info from you guys. 

I was reminiscing about a time I had a Jamaican guy spend time at my college apartment, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can verify what I believe to be true about him. 

The backstory:
I met him in Millersville, PA when he came into the Rock Hill Tavern, where I worked as a cook. The bartender couldn‚Äôt understand what he was asking for because of his heavy accent, so I translated. He was asking for something to eat that didn‚Äôt contain meat. I made him some nachos, and we got to talking about music and hit it off right away. He introduced himself as Roy Cunningham. 
We later went out to the parking lot and he dug out a stash of cassettes that he said were session recordings of Bob Marley and the Wailers. They sounded legit. He then told me that he lived in Vermont for some time and said he jammed with Phish. At this point, I started to think he was just messing with me. We discussed getting together sometime and making some music. I gave him my number and called it a night. I didn‚Äôt hear anything from him until about a month later. 

I received a call from a local hospital out of nowhere. The voice on the line was Roy. He said he got beat up and robbed, and that he needed a ride and a place to spend the night. I picked him up and brought him back to ‚Äúthe house of smooth,‚Äù which is what we called the apartment. He crashed on our couch and slept for a solid 24 hours. Over the next couple days, he was trying to reach some of his family and friends, and they called my place with words of concern about him. Not long after, he was gone. I don‚Äôt know where he went or what became of him. 

Fast forward a few years:
I came across a tape of an old Phish show from Vermont (maybe at Nectar‚Äôs?), and at one point, Trey gives a shoutout to ‚ÄúJah Roy!‚Äù I got chills instantly. Was this the guy? Was he for real when he told me about his musical connections?

Can anyone give any information about this show or Roy? I‚Äôd love to listen to it again and/or hear an update on my unexpected friend. 

Thanks!

Tomorrow I will be recording the second installment of Ask Trey on SiriusXM. It is scheduled to run from 12pm-6pm ET. I am guessing there are a lot of musical breaks throughout. Unclear how much actual Q+A content there is (the first installment was about 90 minutes of actual interview). The 12-6 may even be two airings of it.

Anyway... once the show finishes, I will split up the segments / cut out the music breaks and upload to Soundcloud+Mediafire as soon as possible. 

Due to the scheduled length, I feel it will be pretty late before I have it all packaged and ready to go. Seems like it will require a decent amount of editing, exporting, uploading, etc...

"I've Listened To Everything On The Wiki, Can You Recommend Some More Shows?","Hi guys! I'm really new to all of this, and lately I've been listening to the 11 recommended shows for beginners on the wiki. I haven't had a ton of time to spend on it, but now I'm home for Christmas and I'd like to do a deeper dive. Can anyone suggest 10-15 more shows worth checking out?

I'm open to anything, but my favorite show as of now is 2/28/03, and it's not even close. That Bathtub Gin is my favorite thing I've heard from Phish, followed by Waste on 4/2/98. The only show I haven't liked is 6/14/00. I know it's really popular, but it just feels too...subtle, for me, if that makes sense.

Rethinking 1.0 - 3.0,"Listening to the Ask Trey 2 last night (shout-out to u/Kernel_Forbin for uploading the interviews @ [https://soundcloud.com/user-970720966/sets/ask-trey-volume-2](https://soundcloud.com/user-970720966/sets/ask-trey-volume-2) ) we all got a glimpse into how our favorite lead man see‚Äôs the eras of our favorite band. He hasn‚Äôt really gotten involved in discussions on 1.0 vs. 2.0 vs. 3.0 because he barely knows what that means, but the way he sees Phish eras is a lot more complex then just the time between hiatus‚Äô. In the interview he goes into how he views the bands eras. I wanted to rethink the ideas of the point 0‚Äôs and combine them with Trey‚Äôs views into a more comprehensive look into the eras of Phish. One can probably argue a few of these or break them up even further, but this is pretty much going off of what Trey said and how I see them myself, so open to a bit of interpretation.

PSOTD #116: Sleeping Monkey,"Hello and welcome back to my dumb list. My apologies for missing an entire week. I was going through some self-inflicted non-drug based fuckery. Thanks to those of you who reached out to make sure I was alive and well. Regrettably, I am still here (joke). When we last left off we were in the middle of doing some Mike's Groove tunes. I'm going to wrap that up with the remainder of the week. I head out east on Saturday 12/22. I should be able to write PSOTD kind of sporadically while I'm away from my Phish machine. I've got some great holiday/NYE stuff lined up, but first: Sleeping Monkey.

Sleeping Monkey was first performed on [1992/03/06](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-march-06-1992-the-music-hall-portsmouth-nh-usa.html) and it is written by Tom and Trey. The song tells the tale of someone who is upset about the disappearance (or malfunction) of his monkey. The song kind of sounds like Home On The Range laden with sexual references and double entendres. Instead of antelopes and buffalo's however it's someones revived monkey being sent away. The final chorus is sung with high pitch vocals by Fishman. The ending jam is a tag from The Beatles Let It Be. It is also a notable favorite of Page's with Trey every so often remarking that tonight is not his night before the band embarks into something else for the encore.

Sleeping Monkey began its life exclusively as an encore. In the latter 90's this changed a little bit. The last time it was played outside of an encore was on [2000/06/30.](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-30-2000-meadows-music-theatre-hartford-ct-usa.html) The song is played fairly straight forward every time. The [1992/03/14](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-march-14-1992-roseland-ballroom-new-york-ny-usa.html) performance [features John Popper](https://phish.in/1992-03-14/sleeping-monkey) on harmonica. Another notably strange rendition comes from 2011/07/02 (Super Ball) where the band played a fourth set inside inside a structure labeled USA Storage. It was widely experimental, structure-less, effects-driven improvisation that culminated with a very strange rendition of the song. [Here's some video of the occasion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEiAaKioRhM) Some of you may also remember the [2012/06/20](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-20-2012-ntelos-pavilion-portsmouth-va-usa.html) version with a Star Wars theme tease. During this show (and subsequent summer) Fishman would tuck his dress into his underwear, much to everyone's delight. Trey remarked ""Fish, when you get to the end of this beautiful song, one last time for all of us. One final tuck. It's been a beautiful two days, but it wouldn't be complete without seeing Fishman tuck his dress into his underwear one last time. I'm singing this one right to you Fish, because I am your father."" Sleeping Monkey has appeared in the middle of Mike's Groove two times and today we're going to [go home on the train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y0Ye_eLC1DdBxgyLytEiLXPRJkYVQEcd/view) with the [1999/07/04](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-04-1999-lakewood-amphitheatre-atlanta-ga-usa.html?highlight=514) performance. The trio of songs closed out the second set with Mike's Song&gt;Sleeping Monkey&gt;Weekapaug Groove.

Statistics:             
Sleeping Monkey was played at 4.84% of live Phish shows.              
It was last played July 27, 2018, which was 27 shows ago.

PSOTD 117: I Am Hydrogen,"The human body is about 60 percent water. Water is composed of 2 Hydrogen molecules and 1 Oxygen molecule. That means that you are about 40 percent Hydrogen.

I Am Hydrogen was first performed by Phish on [1985/04/06](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-april-06-1985-finbars-burlington-vt-usa.html). It's an instrumental that was conceived by Tom Marshall and Marc Daubert on piano and acoustic guitar around 1984. They brought it over to Trey's house and he added a harmony to it on his electric guitar. Hydrogen is not meant to be alone and before Mike's Song came along it was paired with the Trey composition [Who Do? We Do!](http://phish.net/song/who-do-we-do/history) (which would eventually wind up in Fluffhead). This pairing occurred four times in 1987. [Here's what it sounded like.](https://phish.in/1987-08-29/i-am-hydrogen) After Halloween 1987 Hydrogen and Who Do? We Do! would part ways. I Am Hydrogen wouldn't be seen for another 9 months and when it emerged on [1988/07/23](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-23-1988-petes-phabulous-phish-phest-underhill-vt-usa.html) it assumed its familiar position between Mike's Song and Weekapaug Groove. After the arrival on Simple in 1994 the binds that tie began to unwind and other songs would begins supplant I Am Hydrogen. Covalent bonds are hard to break however and I Am Hydrogen still makes an appearance in it's rightful spot a few times a year. Ocasionally I Am Hydrogen is played without Mike's or Weekapaug but near as I can tell it hasn't happened since 1999.

The song is played the pretty much the same way every time. It does sporadically inspire dance-like maneuvers between Trey and Mike however. Sometimes this takes the form of a foot ballet, where the guys are on their back with their feet up in the air. Other times Trey and Mike have taken opposite sides of the stage and walked towards each other with a slow, graceful gait. These practices have been largely abandoned since 1996 but the dance break outs do still happen. Today [we'll listen to the most recent](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DOSU9SppBukJeSDu1iQ5jkzitWetiDf/view) I Am Hydrogen from [2018/08/07](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-07-2018-bbt-pavilion-camden-nj-usa.html?highlight=273).

Thank you Phish,"The positivity of Phish and the Phish crowd has recently changed my life in so many ways! I spent a lot of time touring jam bands with no job or real future just hustling to get by and get to the next show. The lack of stability was letting down my family and my girlfriend and effecting my friendships. I really started to dig into phish in 2016 and since then the change has been intense! 
I recently started a corporate job, (I still grow weed though ;P)  I‚Äôve saved a ton of money, I‚Äôve been enjoying the music more and more and partying less and less, and my relationships with my girlfriend, friends and family have grown much stronger. 
My perspective on love, life, family and music has changed into a beautifully positive experience.

I wanted a place where I could share my excitement. 

The experiences I have gotten from phish make me feel so fortunate! The friends I have met, the music I have been exposed to (through phish's catalog alone...), and the connection I feel for the band itself.

No pretty picture this time... but some stats on NYE,"I could take the time to make a fancy infographic on this, but meh, I'm more a data person than a presentation person (this should be obvious by now).  If someone else wants to pretty this up and post it to /r/dataisbeautiful or /r/infographics please be my guest!

I excluded Big Cypress from these results, simply because it's really its own thing - a festival, a 9 hour show, the peak of Phish.  Not just another NYE run.

**Songs Played More/Less Often during NYE Runs**

Besides the obvious Auld Lang Syne, there are some songs we're more likely to see during a NYE run than during the rest of the year.

Many newer or rarer songs have been disproportionately played during NYE runs.  For instance, Your Pet Cat has been played at 13 shows, 3 of which were on NYE runs; thus, you're almost 10 times as likely to see YPC during a NYE run as during any other show (1.0 included, of course).  Grind, Party Time, Sugar Shack, Show of Like, and Walls of the Cave all fall into this category.

Outside of those newer/rarer songs, the number one most New Yearsy song is... **Simple**, which is 218% as likely to appear during a NYE run compared to its usual percentage.  Other popular NYE-run songs include NICU, BotT, BDTNL, Theme, Free, and Tube, all appearing about twice as often.

Oh Kee Pa, My Sweet One, Fee, Esther, Guelah Papyrus, I Am Hydrogen, Buried Alive, and Foam are all less than half as likely to be seen during a NYE run.

I expected to find some popular songs which have never appeared during a NYE run... but such a song *does not exist*.  The only songs which have never appeared during a NYE run are one-offs.

**Songs Played More/Less Often on 12/31**

Again, Auld Lang Syne obviously wins here, and we have the same issue with new/rare songs being disproportionate.

Outside of that stuff, **The Wedge** is the winner of the big night; it's 341% as likely to appear on 12/31 compared to its usual percentage.

Other songs very likely to be seen on 12/31 include:

* Ghost - 319%
* Piper - 319%
* Lawn Boy - 317%
* Simple - 311%
* The Horse/Silent - 307%
* Character Zero - 292%
* Moma Dance, Wilson, Loving Cup, NICU, BDTNL, Glide, PYITE, BoaF, Guyute, and 2001 are all more than twice as likely to be seen on 12/31.

Foam, Bathtub Gin, It's Ice, Funky Bitch, David Bowie, Guelah Papyrus, and GTBT are all less than half as likely to be heard on 12/31 compared to other dates.

We've never had a Fee, Oh Kee Pa, Contact, or Halley's Comet on 12/31.  Will this be the year...?

**Is MSG Special?**

What if we compare MSG NYE runs to other NYE runs?  Are there certain songs which are a tradition at this place, on these nights?

Yes!  **The Horn** is more than three times as likely to appear in a MSG NYE run as at any other NYE run, and Taste, Pipe, Moma Dance, Tube, Wedge, Prince Caspian, Twist, and AC/DC Bag are all more than twice as likely to be a MSG thing.

On the other hand, 8 NYE shows have had Fish sing a song, but only 1 was at MSG.

**Is MSG 12/31 Special?**

**Character Zero** appears at more than half of all 12/31 shows at MSG, but only 14% of other 12/31 shows.  **Piper** is similarly special, appearing at 45% of 12/31 MSG shows but only 14% of other 12/31 shows.  Simple and Antelope are very popular on 12/31, appearing at 71% of shows which aren't at MSG... but only 1/4 of those which are at MSG.

**How long are the songs on 12/31?**

Okay, I lied about the pictures... [here's a graph about song length](https://i.imgur.com/XxbYwAi.png).  This shows how the length of the average song on 12/31 compares to the length of the average song *from that same year*.

No real pattern for 1.0 or 2.0, other than 12/31 tending to be a bit shorter, except when it's not.  In 3.0, NYE is definitely a bit jammier than normal, or at least includes longer songs... except the past few years have been tighter and shorter.

Without judging on if I personally like the music, I think Phish did a great job of writing an album for a fictional band while making the songs sound like Phish was covering them. All the way down to the lyrics that some people hate. The lyrics sound like someone just copy and pasted them into Google translate and took the literal meaning and that if the song was sung in the original language there would be more meaning to them.

We also have to remember that they wrote these songs after some of us (myself not included) said they could only write super positive dad rock.

What a tour this has been! Some quick thoughts.,"There's a fire in Treys eyes that could light a bonfire. He's rock god Trey again, exuding confidence I haven't seen since like 1997. I don't think they're going to let up tonight. I'm not sure I've ever done a run that went zero to hero, tonight could be a first. And the zero/baseline was an INCREDIBLE halloween show. Big jams with several themes, lots of old-school, majestic phish. That harry hood was ripped straight out of the mid-90s. Easily my favorite in over 20 years. If you're not sold on Mercury yet, I hope last nights changed your mind. They're playing with purpose, jamming big time in BOTH sets, and they're chatty. You know when Trey says ""this has been an old show, let's do another old one"" right before GTBT, you know how they're playing. My favorite jam of 3.0 came this tour (at least what I'd consider the darkest, most unique jam) came at Hampton w this golden age. Excited to see what tonight brings, but whatever it is, bravo phish. And bravo phanners for the EXCELLENT energy this tour. Side note: don't be that guy at a show. During the low parts of a jam, don't do long ear-piercing loud whistles.

**Pre-show:**

* Hello party people! Ready for the last show of tour before the NYE run??? I am hosting you tonight from Balmer -- back home visiting family for the weekend. Spent my afternoon down in Alexandria hitting up Rustico's November Beer Festival. It was delicious -- Aslin, Veil, Frog Rocket, etc, etc, etc. Wish I could've brought some back with me for tonight's show! I'm about to go see Bohemian Rhapsody, so I wanted to get the thread up ahead of time for y'all.

"Anyone else receive duplicate PTBMs? We did, last night","So we got our posse of 3 organized and into MGM last night. Up high in 206  - nice neighbors. About a half hour later 3 people arrive beside us... and two of their tickets were identical to ours. And we both had PTBMs, I saw theirs.
To complicate things and make them more exciting, I like to either lose or forget tickets to events. Really gets the old heart going when you realize. So when my suitcase didn‚Äôt make it to Las Vegas, I wrote the fine folk at phishtickets, and they kindly arranged for the tickets to be at Will Call. So we‚Äôve been trotting along to Will Call each eve before the show to pick up tix. We were actually holding those greyish Will Call tix at the show (but I‚Äôve since gotten the luggage and am now holding the actual PTBMs).
After one of their tickets worked, and the next came up ‚Äúalready validated‚Äù they went to Will Call and argued successfully that their original PTBMs should be replaced. Then when they got up to 206, there we were in their seats. I‚Äôve got a photo of 2 identical tickets (except unique barcodes).
Hi to the Stubhub employee from CT who happened to be sitting behind us and was likewise amazed.
So far PTBM is unable to explain.

Kasvot Vax was essentially the Silent Trees gag?,"You all remeber that one?

Trey and i think somebody else start wearing them around on tour like ""Yeah we've always been into these guys"".

"I'm curious, what's your top 5 Jams Of Fall 2018?","Y'all probably watched/listened to more of the fall tour then me! Buuut, that won't top me from listing my top jams I've heard from this tour! I had a great time listening to these jams and it was hard to decide what to pick. These are in no particular order.

&amp;#x200B;

***1: The Albany 20 Years Later:*** Being the tour opener, I didn't expect there to be such a standout jam this early. Especially one so chaotic and evil. Great work all around!

***2: The Hampton Golden Age:*** This is a jam that turned beautifully ambient. It sounds like this jam takes a few minutes to get to liftoff, but once it did, I was swimming in ambience.

***3: The Nashville Scents and Subtle Sounds:*** This jam is just a ton of fun. if you get the chance, watch the free stream of it on Youtube. Trey teasing Runnin' Through The Jungle, Cross-Eyed and Party Time were alot of fun to watch unfold. The audience was feeling it alot!

***4: The Chicago No Man In No Man's Land:*** I think this is still the longest jam of the tour? It moves through some more familiar space before landing on a Mike-led jam that is weird, jarring and funky. Page also stands out in this jam! Reminds me of the BD ASIHTOS in this part.

***5: The Vegas Mercury:*** This jam is the freshest of the bunch, but when I listened to it the day after it happened, I knew it was special. The jams here move fluidly and cohesively. One interesting thing to note is how they subvert the usual peak of the jam earlier than usual and wind down to ambience slowly ala a 12/30/97 ACDC Bag. Which eventually lead to a &gt; Suzy.

"first-timer's phishy poetry.... night 4, vegas","**Prelude**

I attended my first Phish show - tour closing show in vegas this past Saturday. From the moment i entered, the energy was palpable and I could only think in poetry. I let it build, but by set break, it was overflowing in, out, and around me so I had to release some of it.... 

So, what happened after that is below (thanks ""Note"" app).  I'm sharing for two reasons... 1) the encouragement of one particular phishy friend, and 2) because I felt incredibly safe in the magical space we all shared, so i'm hopeful this too is safe. To everyone who was in it with me... thank you. i feel you. i feel me. i get it. Night 4, man. Hope to flow with you in there again real soon. 

p.s. anyone else write phishy poetry? can we be phriends?

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Phishy poetry...**   


It's set break. Eye drops. Marveling. Connecting. Laughing.

Set one was falling in love, bringing us to oneness.

Everyone thinks set two will take us beyond galaxies.

We‚Äôre floating... here... Let‚Äôs go  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  


If I plug in, I can twirl as far as frequencies fly.  


Sway with the flow is the way that you do. I can and you can too!  


I can only think in poetry right now  


Surrender  


Holding any one persons energy for too long here would just be selfish gluttony.  


Honor the space  


Find your beta, and weave magic around it.  


Almost too afraid to absorb from all my senses... what‚Äôs beyond?  


There is no ‚Äúright,‚Äù only curiosity.  


Love should feel like the closing set of night 4  


Feels so good to let go,  
say how you feel  


safe for the first time at phish  


So we jumped  


He didn‚Äôt beam me up... he helped me realize I‚Äôm already in it.  


We‚Äôve all been in it this whole time

&amp;#x200B;

wading for transcendence  


Melting our soul one chord at a time  
Letting us drift just far enough  
before bringing us back  
always bringing us back  


Until we are swimming in the velvet sea  


Slowly picking you off the floor  
little by little until suddenly there you are jumping again, reaching far ....  
Building up only to  
Split you open up all over again.  


Melt. melt. melt. melt.  


Love can be  


No matter how far you go, you‚Äôre here.  


Found myself in the velvet sea. all (awareness) in on what will be  


So let go,  
let everything melt away, sway, off into the bay. Let the moment float right on by.. Loop back in and you‚Äôll see why  


Let go  
Let go  
Let go go go go

...

PTBM didn't scan -- need advice,"  
I need some advice from the Phish community...  


I sold my 2 Vegas PTBM to someone for $40. It was SUPER last minute (it was basically sell to him or eat the cost entirely). I met the guy; he seemed totally legit and like an actual phan.  


He emailed me right around the show opener to tell me that neither ticket scanned. The venue thought he was selling fake tickets (since he had 2 of them), they took the tickets from him, and kicked him out of the venue.  


Obviously I have no way of knowing if this is true or not...but my gut tells me he's not just trying to get his $40 back (he drove way out of his way in Los Angeles to get the tickets which seems like a pain in and of itself).   


But my question is -- **has anyone had this experience where PTBM tickets didn't scan?** I didn't post the tickets online anywhere so there's no chance anyone could have faked the barcode or whatever.  


Second question is -- **who can I reach out to on Phish's end to try and recoup the costs for the original tickets?** (Assuming what the guy said, if they really didn't scan, I'd like my original money back!)  


Just curious to see what the community thinks about this...Thanks!",phish,1541443718,jkbriskman,5,1,True,2018-11-05

Vegas Split Open and Melt was a ghost ship!,"So a few years back, I read a tweet (I believe it was from @WooketteProblms) comparing a Melt jam to the sound of two old wooden ships crashing into each other. Since then, every time I've seen a Melt I've closed my eyes during the jam and imagined myself on the deck of an old wooden ship as it hit stormy seas, swaying back and forth trying to maintain balance as the rough seas toss the ship every which way. As the jam gets darker and darker, eventually the ship crashes into another ship, or crashes into the shore (god I would love a SOAM -&gt; Shipwreck -&gt; SOAM), or what have you. Usually no survivors. 

Anyway, during the Vegas Melt, the waves were getting rough; a huge swell descended, and all of a sudden there was another ship directly in front of us, no getting out of the way, certain doom. I braced myself for the inevitable, but when the two ships met, ours passed right through. It was a ghost ship!!! I love this band so much.",phish,1541446086,thoughtsausages,10,1,True,2018-11-05
Thoughts from my Vegas Run,"I decided to stay in Vegas for an extra day, partially so I could literally just lie in bed in an air-conditioned room and recover and partially because flights out of Vegas on Monday morning were way cheaper, and I wrote down some thoughts I had from the run:

1) The biggest thing I kept coming back to during the run was the shift away from the telegraphed white-light-peak. Not that I don‚Äôt love the build into a glorious peak (and not that they didn't have a few of those), but some of my favorite jams from the run didn‚Äôt follow that template ‚Äî I guess that‚Äôs part of the ‚Äúegalitarian jamming‚Äù I was hearing about. I listened to a lot of the tour, but it was reaaaally noticeable live. I think the Tweezer from N1 was where I really felt it first, and a lot of my favorite jams had this patient and exploratory vibe that didn‚Äôt have a detour into a major key change and a bliss peak. It might not be the full return to Evil Phish that I crave, but I‚Äôm SUPER into it.

2) Holy shit, the Kasvot Vaxt set was INSANELY catchy live. I found myself singing along to every song by the time they finished. Walking around Vegas, I heard almost every song being sung randomly (but ‚ÄúThis is what space smells like‚Äù, ‚ÄúDeath don‚Äôt hurt very long‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe are going to outlive our brains‚Äù seemed to be what I heard most often.) Can‚Äôt wait to see which of these tracks gets the regular rotation call.

3) Trey kept doing this thing where he‚Äôd deliver a lyric just a beat off, and his phrasing would be a little late, or delayed or something. Weird.

4) For the first time in 3.0, I noticed Fishman flubs more than I did Trey flubs. Fishman was still the MVP of a lot of jams, but he used to be the bedrock you could always count on, while Trey would be the one to forget how to play the Sugar Shack solo.

5) It's been said before, but CK5 is on another level right now. I was floor for N1 and N2, Lower Bowl for N3 and Upper Bowl for N4, and no matter where I was, the lights were fucking insane.

6) Vegas is the worst. But also the best. It's the perfect amplifier to take a Phish run and blast it off into the stratosphere, but holy shit is that city the seventh circle of hell.

7) Favorite Jams (before a full run re-listen): Tweezer, Wolfman‚Äôs, Chalkdust, Blaze On &gt; NMINML, MERCURY, Soul Planet &gt; DWD, Sally, Tube, Carini, SASS.

8) Favorite Moment: When they dropped into half-time funk during the Chalkdust jam. The get-down was REAL in my section during that jam.",phish,1541447093,hwedwards,22,1,True,2018-11-05

I'm curious -- what are your top 5 jams of Fall '18?,"Give a few reasons if you can, will try to listen for those parts specifically! My top 5 would be as follows:

1. Hampton Golden Age -- one of the more unique jams of 3.0. Basically a giant puddle of weirdness for 23 minutes. This is the dark phish I loved in the late 90s, so glad they're back to it on a regular basis. 

2. Vegas SOAMelt -- some bliss, some space, some dissonance. Nailed the landing taboos. 

3. Vegas Mercury -- finally they do this song the justice it deserves. Was right in the meat of easily my favorite show of 3.0 (which is saying a lot since about half of my shows now are 3.0, the other half being 1.0). 

4. Hampton Simple -- another outstanding set I jam. Some funk, some space, multilevel peak. 

5. Vegas Harry Hood -- the 5 slot is hard for me. This one could easily go to a number of jams, including Rosemont NMINML, Vegas Carini, Vegas Light. The hood eeks out the win as it gets blissful, reminiscent of some mid-90s hoods and had a furious peak. ",phish,1541638349,ski4theapres,22,1,True,2018-11-07

And as the jam dissolves into what most people probably thought would be the end -- it wasn't.  They did NOT want this song/set/run/tour to end.

PSOTD #99: Mercury,"Welcome back. The chaos that consumed my life over the last 24 days or so has now been replaced with the soothing familiarity of routine and order. How does that affect you? Well, it means you'll be getting PSOTD at your regularly scheduled intervals again. I think I'll be going back to the animal song well at some point but for now I'm just going curate the list as I see fit. Also tomorrow will be PSOTD  #100 and I'll release the list of all the songs I've done in case any of you want a re-release. Anyway, as promised, here's Mercury.

Mercury debuted on [2015/07/22](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-22-2015-les-schwab-amphitheater-bend-or-usa.html?highlight=2573) in a kind of strange first set that included the Phish debuts of  Mike Gordon's How Many People Are You, Page's Heavy Rotation and TAB's Scabbard. Mercury is written by the ever faithful writing team of Trey and Tom. Mercury was conceived with a batch of songs that would go on to be Big Boat. Ultimately Mercury would end up on the cutting room floor. Fortunately for us it still makes rotation.

Musically the song is a multi-part composition with kind of prog-rock influences. The song dates to a writing session in Kitty Hawk, NC near where the Wright brothers took their first flight. It took Trey several weeks to add all the music and it's taken the band some time to let the song loose into the improvisational beast it has become. When asked about the song Tom Marshall said ""I've always liked Mercury- the planet, the god, the element- and decided it needed a tribute"". That's exactly what we got. Unlike Phish songs of old that contain nonsensical lyrics all of Mercury is fairly well researched.  Mercury is referenced frequently throughout the song, some of those ways are in relation to the planet (the time it takes to rotate the sun and it's color) other references allude to the element. The wings said to be on the feet of the Roman god Mercury are referenced. The Red Queen in the song is a reference to the Mayan noblewoman whose remains were discovered covered in vermilion powder inside a hidden sarcophagus in 1994. Homer's the Odyssey recounts the story of Vulcan trapping his unfaithful wife, Venus, in a netting of unbreakable chains. Mercury says that he'd still happily sleep with her if he could, even if it resulted in him being tied up in three times as many chains. The unbreakable net in the song manages to evoke a sense of safety and security.

In 2015 Mercury was played three times. On [2015/09/05](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-september-05-2015-dicks-sporting-goods-park-commerce-city-co-usa.html?highlight=2573) Mercury was played with a four and a half minute jam, up from the 90 second one that occurred at it's debut. The song would then be shelved for a calendar year returning at Dicks 2016. The song would still end up making four appearances that year. 2017 saw three attempts at Mercury. We're currently in the dawn of Mercury with six attempts so far in 2018 (and I bet we've got one more taboot). The song is usually found in the second set although it's not uncommon to see it in the first. Twenty-five percent of the time the song is played it is followed directly by Light. Today we're going to look at [the very edible](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fzjb_-kYwRge8zICUnZfgfLh-EDuOjO8/view) (and most recent) [2018/11/02](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-november-02-2018-mgm-grand-garden-arena-las-vegas-nv-usa.html?highlight=2573) version.

Also after listening to pretty much nothing but Phish since my release last February, I am slightly Phish-ed out. Obviously this won't affect the emails but I need something else to listen to. So I'm seeking suggestions of non-jam band based music. I failed to post a single fall tour show for you guys but I'll make up for it by posting the whole tour right now! It can be found [here](https://we.tl/t-d8czKyEEUl) and [here](https://we.tl/t-elvDOwAXu3) and [here](https://we.tl/t-0UbQMKQKH2).

Does CK5 eve talk about getting to rehearse with the band or are live shows his only practice?,Watching some videos this morning and I had a thought. I know the band gets plenty of time to rehearse together but I don't remember anything about whether or not Kuroda gets extra time to practice the lights with them. Is there an interview somewhere where he talks about this? I already find what he's doing incredibly impressive but i'd be very interested to hear what he has to say in regards to practice.,phish,1541696173,timefordameatstick,8,1,True,2018-11-08
Donut Logo History,My first show was in 1993 - The only donut logo I remember was Fishman‚Äôs smock - which I always thought was grey with orange circles.  Coming back to the Pham (after having a few babies) in the last couple years I‚Äôve been blown away by how it has become THE symbol for the fans! And that it was red and blue?! Hahah Can anyone tell me when the merch started? When it became the SIGN? Is there a history lesson you could share? I read that the smock and the tee were being trademarked? Just super curious! ,phish,1541703029,DanceMama,7,1,True,2018-11-08
Halloween 2018 Highlights,"From my favourite new record since Undermind, to the heartfelt and emotional ‚Äúthank you‚Äù from Fishman on N3, I felt the magic last week. I no longer have a Curveball sized hole in my head, and I hope the band doesn‚Äôt either. 

New ALL-TIME favourite versions of tunes:
SOAM, Hood, Mercury, Blaze On, and First Tube

Best Jams: Literally all of them. Was there a song they jammed? It was sick, top tier 3.0 jamming... bet on it.

Likely Unpopular Opinion: Night 3 was the pound for pound best Phish show all year. My heart melted a bit when Trey said ‚ÄúThis feels like an old show...‚Äù before proceeding to crush that Good Times Bad Times. Screaming through fucking space that night... could smell it coming from the opening bars of Cavern.

What a run... 

Further Highlights: 
-Trey on the white Strat, strutting around ripping solos like an absolute rockstar,

-Gordo jumping off the drum riser like an absolute rockstar.

-Fishman twerking and dancing on the grand piano, reminding us that he is still indeed ‚ÄúToo hot for the hot tub.‚Äù 

-Paige new shoe goofin‚Äô. 

-Fuzzy white monitors. 

-CK5 getting the lights to look like dice slowly rolling, and the pyramids he was building on Night 3, and of course the Transformer Spider shapes throughout. 

-If I Could bust out, Trey slayed the jam, and a single tear rolled down my cheek. I love that song... and into Weigh had me grinning like a Cheshire Cat. 

-My buddy getting his 46 Days request from the band for his 365th show on Night 4, just a few weeks after his 46th birthday.

-The amount of savage NY State DOH water inspector costumes on Halloween. 

-The MGM staff. Maybe they‚Äôve had a rough October until we arrived, that one UFC event was no joke, but they seemed extra chill this year. 

-YOU PEOPLE. see you next summer ‚ù§Ô∏è

Funny(?) poster story I was just reminded of,"Sorry, it's a wall of text. Here's a story I thought you guys might appreciate event though it's mostly Jerry Garcia-related:
I follow an account on Twitter (@TigerRose420) that tweets great, rare photos of Jerry and the Dead. She had one there today that looked really familiar and got me to thinking. Let me take you back to 1993...
I had already seen Phish at the Spectrum in Toronto and was a phan. And already a big GD fan. I was teaching English in Tokyo and learned there would be an exhibition of original Jerry Garcia water colours and sketches, etc. in a big department store called Parco. For Phish context, that's also where I bought my CD copy of both Junta and Lawn Boy and was studiously learning all the ingredients to Reba's phinest creation. Cut to exhibition day. I go way downtown after work, in my suit, to a GIANT department store near Shibuya called Parco (think Macy's or Bloomingdales). I enjoy the very small but interesting art show of Jerry's. In a few places throughout the store are these GINORMOUS promotional posters of Jerry with lots of Japanese written on them. I really want one as a memento. So I start asking around to the staff to see how I could get one. They basically couldn't/didn't/wouldn't understand what I was asking or what I wanted and kept saying ""no, not for sale"". Picture a foam core-backed poster board, maybe 3 feet by 5 feet. I keep asking for managers, supervisors, who is in charge and who can help me. Nothing. So in a moment I'm not particularly proud of (but sort of) - I literally take one off the wall and make a bee line for the exit. You have to picture an (almost) six-foot tall white guy, well-dressed in a suit taking stuff literally off the wall in a Japanese department store and running. I quickly make for an exit, get outside and duck into the nearest store and hurriedly request a garbage bag (which I managed to get). Of course it doesn't fit inside because it's so big so the top of his head is sticking out of this bag. I get on a very, very packed train with this thing and commute 2+ hours back home. When it came time to leave Japan I wanted that poster but there was no way I was going to backpack through Thailand with it. So I very carefully and meticulously spent my evenings gingerly peeling the poster from the foam core backing. Then I rolled it up and shlepped it through Thailand for a month and ultimately back to Canada. Flash to today: I see a similar image, start Googling, find what I'm looking for and that's my story. I have no idea where it is today.

TLDR: I stole [this](https://www.proxibid.com/3-Jerry-Garcia-1993-Parco-Art-Gallery-Tokyo-Poster/lotInformation/24189025) Jerry Garcia poster in Japan 25 years ago from the same store where I first bought Junta and Lawnboy.",phish,1541714463,sal139,1,1,True,2018-11-08

Reflections on Halloween and 3.0+,"So Halloween has since past and there seems to be an ominous theme emerging across the horizon. This years costume set was their best yet, a set that left everyone more than satisfied while trolling the fan base with one of their quirky jokes. ‚ÄúKasvot V√§xt - i rokk‚Äù was perfect, an imagined band, a ghostly album as per the Phishbill, a whole set of not-quite Phish Phish, but it‚Äôs very telling.

What I noticed about this set is that the band is once again steering into a more creative direction.  So what‚Äôs next for Phish? What‚Äôs next for Halloween?  Why does it matter?   

Let‚Äôs start with the last question first, it doesn‚Äôt matter, the band has clearly found where they want to be. 

As for future Halloween‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not holding out for Zeppelin or Zevon anymore.  They‚Äôve gone from the kids that trick or treat in superhero costumes to insanely original designs of their own. My guess is that they‚Äôll play themselves again one year, but something different ‚Äî like TMWSIY, but maybe a parallel ‚Äúsenior thesis‚Äù of sorts. 

As for the band, nothing but good things in their future, as long as they steer clear from shady investments and the lure of the backstage environment, they‚Äôll be doing this for a while.",phish,1541752133,jam705,3,1,True,2018-11-09

PSOTD #100,"Well, I made it to 100 of these. It took a while, but I did it. If I really buckled down I probably could have done more in the time frame. Really the slower I go the longer everyone gets to enjoy PSOTD because there is only a finite amount of Phish songs. Eventually it will become a show of the week email, but now is not that time. A promise is a promise so here's the [complete list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y49kC1A1x5SPPzgF8yh0k-PhKX9zJBMaJ5FG1a8oIv8/edit) of songs I've done. If there's any specifically that you'd like to read please let me know and I'll do my absolute best to get them to you in a timely fashion but I am just one man and believe it or not I do have one other hobby outside of this band. Today we're getting bitten by the (kind of) deep cut Access Me.

Access Me was written by Mike and is sung by Mike. It debuted on [2004/06/26](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-26-2004-alpine-valley-music-theatre-east-troy-wi-usa.html). It's on the 2004 album Undermind. The song has a walking reggae bass line and includes some of the sonic dissonance that 2004 Phish became very well known for. Access Me tells the story of someone pursuing love with another individual and doing everything in their power to please the object of their affection. This includes confirming to ""their thoughts on the way"" the narrator should be. I, for the most part, tend to like the lyrics Mike chooses to write. Every time I hear it I get taken back to being love sick about someone for the first time. Or how exciting it is when you first meet someone so intriguing that you're willing to open up all of yourself to them in hopes that they do the same.

Undermind as an album holds the distinction of being comprised of songs that have statistically seen the least amount of live performances. Unsurprisingly, Access Me has been no exception. To date there have been five performances of the song, one for 2004, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The song has been played twice at Alpine Valley and is always in the first set. It's currently enjoying a 243 show gap. Today we'll [play the part](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-_YrhKxs8V7XHY8UK0Yps7XO3-1619mL/view) of the debut performance from 2004/06/26. I'm also going to [plead and beg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10wl7LP8uDDLLN1IYmR6Z0Yym-3ggCxwr/view) that you check out the studio version as well.

Statistics:         
Access Me was played at 0.28% of live Phish shows.         
It was last played July 1, 2012, which was 243 shows ago.          
There have been 401 shows since the live debut.         
Access Me has been played approximately once every 363.6 shows.        
Since its debut, Access Me has been played, on average, once every 80.2 shows.

How did Phish benefit from the death of Jerry Garcia?,"I know the subject is macabre, and no one wants Jerry alive today more than Phish, but I read that the Phish Phollowing expanded when Deadheads where left leaderless. Obviously to answer this question I need someone who can compare the paths of Phish's trajectory from let's say '93-'95 and with where they went from '95 and beyond the infinite. So my question is, would Phish have continued playing ""second fiddle"" if the Dead never broke up?

Have you ever gone to a show where you just knew that this sound was the one.

No
 
It won‚Äôt.  Your moment is always derived by that moment in the jam that you plug in.  Where nothing will pull you away from the groove.  

You find your note, you find your key,  you set your gear shift into the correct gear.

With New Year's Eve approaching I'd say its time to reflect on Phish 2018 just a little,"So I've always thought of NYE as a transition into the new year and not completly a part of the year before. NYE 2017 brought us the introduction of Soul Planet, which carried heavily into 2018. I think Hampton might have been the only ""soul-less"" run (someone will correct me if I'm wrong). With that said, what has been your personal highlights and accomplishments with Phish in 2018? How many shows did you see and where? After my introduction to Phish at Alpharetta 2016 and a loooong year and a half of waiting, I got back with the fam at Alpharetta, Hampton, and Nashville. Alpharetta N1 was my first time on the floor and it ended up being a top 5'er for the year. Got both Baker's Dozen bustouts (Sexy Thing Alpharetta and Strawberry Letter 23 Hampton). First time at the Coliseum did not disappoint and it was my first time travelling for tour. Miracled 3 first timers and got another buddy to come to his first shows. Hit show number 10 my last night in Nashville! So many personal first time heards. I can say after 5 shows in one week I was a little fatigued on Phish, maybe some of the jaded vets need to find something different to listen to for the first time in 20 years. Oh yeah, and I drove 15 hours to see beautiful upstate New York for a few days before coming home, nothing special!",phish,1541942963,helpingfriendlyneph,17,1,True,2018-11-11

PSOTD #101: Happy Birthday To You,"The idea of celebrating your birth date is a pagan tradition. Many Christians didn't celebrate birthdays historically because of that. Pagans thought that evil spirits lurked on days of major changes, like the day you turn a year older. Starting around the 19th century ones date of birth was regarded as something worth celebrating and the ritual of birthdays began to spread. The song associated with the birthday tradition is an entirely different animal. The 1893 songbook Song Stories for the Kindergarten included a song called ""Good Morning to All"" written by the Louisville sisters Mildred and Patty Hill. A man named Robert Coleman came along, changed the lyrics from ""good morning, dear children"" to ""happy brithday, dear (name)"" and claimed ownership. The sisters would sue, win and began claiming copyrights and royalties of their own. That was the end of the disputes, sort of. In 1935 The Summy Company registered a copyright to the song ""Happy Birthday"" which is essentially the same thing as ""Happy Birthday To You"" but shorter. This kicked off a whole new round of legal battles that wouldn't get all the way settled until 2016 when the courts officially ruled the song as public domain. By some estimates it is the highest-earning single song in history with estimated earnings of $50 million since it's inception.

Way back on [1983/12/02](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-02-1983-harris-millis-cafeteria-university-of-vermont-burlington-vt-usa.html), however, Phish debuted for the first time and Happy Birthday To You closed out the first set. Phish would go on to perform the song for various people close to the band many times over the course of their career. Sometimes they play the song traditionally other times they give it a different spin. Mike has had two performances of the song dedicated to him on stage (1988/06/03 and 1989/06/03), Fishman has also had two (1991/02/19, 1993/02/19) and Page has three performances for him (1991/05/17, 1992/05/17, 1994/05/17). Long time Phish set and light designer Chris Kuroda has also had three performances of the song in his honor (1991/07/26, 1999/07/25, 2013/07/26). The 1999 version is particularly notable because it featured a solo from each band member and then a light solo from CK5 himself. It doesn't appear that the band itself has had Trey sing Happy Birthday, to, well himself. However, on three occasions the audience did the singing for him (1990/09/29, 1999/09/29 and 2000/09/30). Other targets for the birthday treatment have included a Heather, Erica, Dimitri, Wesley and Greenpeace Dana. On 1989/10/06 Fishman performed the song, including the vacuum, for his brother David. Fishmans, father Leonard, would get the same treatment on 2009/03/08. The tradition continues with the most recent performance coming from 2016/06/25 at Wrigley Field for their tour manager.  Today [we'll check out](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rWHK8JQbUpzWUaRQgaidW77X1P3D1bXp/view) the [2015/08/21](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-21-2015-watkins-glen-international-watkins-glen-ny-usa.html?highlight=248) version where Trey had the audience sing the song for his daughters 20th birthday.

PSOTD #102,"Mercifully my life is just about halfway over. Thanks to all of you for the birthday well wishing. If I could I'd take you all out to Dinner and a Movie.

Dinner and a Movie made it's debut on [1987/11/19](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-november-19-1987-hunts-burlington-vt-usa.htmlhttp://phish.net/setlists/phish-november-19-1987-hunts-burlington-vt-usa.html) and is written by The Dude of Life aka Steve Pollak. The Dude became friends with Trey in high school and would play with him in the band Space Antelope. He's co-authored numerous Phish songs including but not limited to Suzy Greenberg, Fluffhead (which is about his brother who died of cancer, don't worry we'll get there) and Sanity. He's been known to appear on stage sporadically at Phish shows to sing his songs and occasionally get up to other hi-jinks such as throwing out rubber animals with sharpie inscriptions from himself and members of the band. To the best of my knowledge he is currently teaching elementary school.

Anyway Dinner and a Movie is a classic Phish song where the only lyrics are ""Let's go out to dinner and see a movie"". Before the band played the song on 1991/05/18 Fishman remarked that the song celebrated ""America's favorite prenuptial ritual"" and that's basically the joke. The song was played heavily from 1989 until 1992, typically as a first set opener or before Bouncing Around The Room. As time wore on the band agreed the joke had worn thin and the song was essentially taken out to pasture. It was played on [2004/06/17](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-17-2004-keyspan-park-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) as a nod to the fact that the show was being simulcast in movie theaters across the country. The song has seen 8 performances since 2009. I'd like to encourage you to check out the [1991/07/12](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-12-1991-the-colonial-theatre-keene-nh-usa.html?highlight=158) performance which is easily accessible on Live Phish 19.

None of the other members of the game are Phish fans, so when I told them my name, their minds went to the Occulus Rift. I didn‚Äôt bother correcting them, but eventually I‚Äôll explain the origin of the name to them. One player suggest I take on ‚Äúthe Rift‚Äù as my title, becoming Icculus, the Rift.

Phishy Synchronicities CONTINUED,"I saw the post about the cool coincidence the guy playing D&amp;D had with his character Icculus and Rift. I posted this story in that thread but reliving it just now inspired me to make my own Phishy Synchronicity post.

So this is a kind of long one but the payoff is worth it.

I bought tickets to Tahoe earlier in the year off stub hub about a week prior to the event. I received email confirmations for both saying the tickets were in the mail, second night arriving first, first night arriving a day later. Fucking sweet.

So I go to my local karaoke haunt a fee days before the shows and decide to see if they have any Phish. It was slim pickings but they had Free so I sang it gleefully in anticipation of my Tahoe trip.

The first ticket arrives. It's one if the physical tickets too, not a Ticketmaster ticket. So cool. Can't wait for second one to arrive. 

So I decide to check the tracking and I discover that the seller did not put the ticket in the mail on time and it was expected to arrive at my house by end of day THE DAY OF THE SHOW. 309 miles away from the venue. Oh HELL no.

So I call StubHub. They are very nice but after about an hour they tell me there are zero more tickets for that night available and all they can do is refund my money. 

But I already took vacation days! I booked the Airbnb! 

Sorry Charlie. 

They refunded my money and threw in a $20 credit to ease the blow.

I'm totally deflated. Sure I can probably find a scalper roaming stateline but I REALLY don't like winging my vacations.

My coworker, who was overhearing my conversation, tapped me on the shoulder. 

You should call UPS, dude. 

Naw, StubHub said there was nothing they could do. It's over, man.

You should just call.

So I call. In ten minutes the UPS guy is able to intercept the package, FREE of charge, and I can pick it up at one of their distribution centers on my way to the venue. 

So I go to the designated place at the designated time on my way to Tahoe and sure enough there's my ticket.

So now I have a FREE ticket in my hand as well as $20 credit on StubHub which I used for a FREE ticket to the forum a few weeks later.

I get to Tahoe. We eagerly wait and wonder what the summer tour opener would be.

PSOTD #103: Fast Enough For You,"My apologies for missing yesterday. I had to write a different article for a non-Phish based email I send out and I really only have one long email in me per day. Recently I was talking to someone about fear based anxiety in relation to me getting all my shit together. I happened to remark how no one told me how long it would take and how it wasn't going nearly fast enough for me.

Fast Enough For You debuted on [1992/11/19](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-november-19-1992-ross-arena-st-michaels-college-colchester-vt-usa.html). It is sung by Trey with Mike and Page providing the backing vocals. It is written by Trey and Tom. The lyrics of Fast Enough For You ask what relationships would be like if the burden of time were lifted and we were free from the pressure to rush forward to the next milestone, crisis or resolution. Ideally we wouldn't burden each other with unmet needs and things would be a lot happier. That's not the way it is though and the lover the narrator of the song speaks to is not happy with the pace of their relationship and becomes the object of their scorn. Musically the performances vary very little from one attempt to the next with the exception of the outro solo. However, some performances just have a little more heart in them than others.

Phish ballads seem to come and go as does my enjoyment of certain ones. Fortunately we are at point with the band where they have a large selection of them to choose from, but this wasn't always the case. When Fast Enough For You debuted in November 1992 they really hammered it home. They played the song 9 times in five weeks after it debuted. 1993 saw 17 performances of the song. New ballads were introduced early in 1994 but FEFY was still performed 14 times. After this the frequency with which the song was played would begin to slow down. By 1997 the song had become a relative rarity and it has essentially stayed that way. The band was good for two performances a year in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The song took a year long break in 2012 and 2015. It was performed twice in 2013 then once in 2014, 2016 and 2017. It has yet to make an appearance this year but I'd imagine we'll get a glimpse of it on NYE. Slightly over half of the performances come in the first set. Today we'll [pile another stone on](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xVG-xRKgla9ngSalgfsMEMuhj8-w1Puj/view?usp=sharing) my homer shrine with the [1996/08/13](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-13-1996-deer-creek-music-center-noblesville-in-usa.html?highlight=194) Deer Creek performance.

Statistics:                         
Fast Enough for You was played at 4.13% of live Phish shows.          
It was last played January 14, 2017, which was 61 shows ago.        
There have been 1,128 shows since the live debut.

PSOTD #92,"Of course, of course, we can't talk about The Horse without including it's companion piece Silent In The Morning. The Horse has been played without Silent In The Morning two times. One time was because the fire alarm went off as they started the show and the venue had to be evacuated and the other time was because Trey hit some sour notes and abandoned it. They did play Silent the next night to round it out though. Silent In The Morning is occasionally played without The Horse but to see the song by it's lonesome is still a rarity.

Silent In The Morning debuted along side The Horse on [1992/03/07](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-march-07-1992-the-music-hall-portsmouth-nh-usa.html). It is written by Trey and Tom and sung by Page with the rest of the band providing backing vocals. Silent rounds out the Rift concept. It has the narrator waking up and beginning to question the events he has seen. Silent showcases the bands fantastic ability to build tension and create a cacophony of sound that washes the listener with an ethereal sense of relief. Silent also makes frequent appearances on New Years Eve because it gives the audience a chance to cheer for ""just last year"".

The duo has seen frequent rotation since their inception. The longest time the band has gone without playing the songs has been 45 shows. This occurred after the first hiatus from 2003-2004 when the song was only played twice. Currently they work the songs in about three times a year.

PSOTD #93,"Today we'll be wrapping up ungulate songs and moving on to [spooky](https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/d22/8d/8d9536a8cb5c7bf1.jpg) Halloween stuff. Steam debuted on [2011/06/04](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-04-2011-blossom-music-center-cuyahoga-falls-oh-usa.html) and is written by Tom and Trey and sung by Trey. The first verse comes out of an ambience cesspool and into a slow groove that drives the song onward. The pressure builds toward and out-gassing which is followed by some jam space. tHe band claims the song is inspired by A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin but overall consensus is that it's obviously a song about The Dark Tower series by Stephen King. On multiple occasions the lyrics reference the tower, a solitary flower and a mysterious man that someone needs protecting from. Anyone who has read these books can tell you that those are direct references to the series. In 2013 Stephen King released the sequel to The Shining called Doctor Sleep and in it these people are feeding off a ""steam"" that gets emitted when children with the shining are slowly tortured. This is enough confirmation for me to conclude that Stephen King is as much of a fan of Phish as they are of his.

Steam is one of my top 5 Phish songs released after 2009. The layers, effects, intricate jams and fantasy lyrics in this song just get me there. Steam can almost always be found as the third or fourth song in the second set. It's where it debuted and it's where it has mostly stayed. There have been two first set performances. The band is usually good for about four performances of the song a year and we've already reached that in 2018 so perhaps it won't appear during the Halloween run this year. Piper has followed Steam 21 percent of the time (7 out of 32 performances). On [2013/12/28](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-28-2013-madison-square-garden-new-york-ny-usa.html?highlight=1355) we saw a 12 minute [emission](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FPhFxMXynUV_AEnZW9lM2qW--iYcP62Q/view) and that's what we'll be checking out today. [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwAVi_hHEFc) from the performance too because they really do a great job of making it look like steam is encapsulating the band.

Statistics
Steam was played at 1.76% of live Phish shows.           
It was last played September 2, 2018, which was 0 shows ago.

PSOTD #94,"Buried Alive is an instrumental written by Trey. It debuted on [1990/09/13](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-september-13-1990-the-wetlands-preserve-new-york-ny-usa.html) the fast frantic pace of the guitar leave the listener with an image of a person who is buried alive and fighting to escape. In 1992 Jimmy Herring was in the crowd because Aquarium Rescue Unite had opened for Phish. Trey remarked that the song was inspired Jimmy and it does kind of sound like something Jimmy would play.

The song is usually used a show opener because it sets the mood right with it's fast beat and screaming guitar. From it's debut in 1990 until 1994 the song was played frequently. It saw 3 or 4 appearances a year from 1995 until 1998. The song wasn't played in 1999 and had one appearance in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. 2012 and 2014 both saw two performances of the song. The two longest gaps are 90 and 60 shows. The song hasn't been played this year so I'd assume at some point here we're going to get our one shot of it. We're going to [check out](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Aw_m2o0BjcNv2Zv3PFnUtGq1nUK_jAr/view) the show opening [2014/10/31](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-october-31-2014-mgm-grand-garden-arena-las-vegas-nv-usa.html?highlight=96) version.

Or was the show just one long Buried Alive?

The Anatomy of a Tour Announcement (classic repost),"Anatomy of a Tour Announcement:

1) Initial flurry of selfings, ranging from tour date predictions to mistaken venues.

2) Complaints about tour dates, venues, ticket price, and the band itself.

3) Noob influx, as noted by the second round of selfings - multiple orders on same card, etc. General inability to read instructions becomes apparent.

4) Sporadic conflicts erupt over perceived abuse of the lottery system, coupled with demands that a merit system / old mail order system be put in place. 

5) Noob anxiety escalates as the lottery closes. Within hours, people demand to know when the results will be announced.

6) General chaos ensues, as holds appear and disappear from cards, cards are lost, ex-girlfriends cancel cards. 

7) Results come out. The ""Haves"" mercilessly taunt the ""Have Nots"". More fights break out over multiple orders, and scalpers flood the board. Noobs begin to chart StubHub prices. 

8) Preparation begins for the great TicketMaster rodeo. Practice threads pop up, along with potential backdoor links. Noobs crowing about ""scoring on StubHub"", and not having to worry about TM. 

9) Ticketmaster onsale. Server crashes immediately, 23 ""f*** TM"" threads simultaneously appear. 

10) Three minutes later, all difficult shows sold out. Front page consumed by ticket trade offers. People lick their wounds, exchange TM queue wait times. Back door link folks rejoice.

11) The forum slowly devolves back to ""normal"". Random outbreaks of anger and selfings occur as ticket trades go south.",phish,1539121016,thatsrickdiculous,3,1,True,2018-10-09

My Phish sob story,"I got into Phish back in late 2015. My first show was supposed to be 7/6/16 in Portland, ME. Unfortunately, I was injured with a really bad concussion and couldn‚Äôt make the show. I also had 7/9/16 tickets to Hartford and had to skip that show as well. My fianc√© went to the Portland show and I told him to miracle my Portland ticket and both of the Hartford tickets outside the venue.  We live right in Portland so it didn‚Äôt make sense for him to skip that show but he didn‚Äôt want to go to Hartford without me. 

Fast forward to this spring. I surprised my fianc√© with Curveball tickets. I don‚Äôt really need to go into detail about this because I know many of you experienced the same heartbreak that I did. Months of planning, time off work, arranging a dog sitter, buying supplies, driving 19 hours straight round trip all for naught.  Another missed opportunity of seeing my favorite band. 

And then the NYE announcement came. I put in for the lottery for 12/30 and 12/31 knowing that there‚Äôs a good chance I won‚Äôt get tickets. Booked a refundable hotel room for good measure. My fianc√©‚Äôs birthday is 12/29 and this would be his birthday gift from me. I owe him big time for introducing me to this band. But of course, like so many others, I got my rejection email last night. 

I‚Äôm going to try to battle the Ticketmaster machine on Friday. I‚Äôll be at work so I‚Äôm going to plan my lunch break around the on sale time, but I‚Äôm still expecting to get shut out. 

So! If anyone out there got extra tickets or can‚Äôt make the show and would be interested in helping this girl see Phish for the first time and selling me their tickets to 12/30 and 12/31, you would be an absolutely amazing human being.  I‚Äôll pay face + fees + shipping + a little extra to make it worth your while.

I‚Äôve been in love with this band for the last 3 years and have yet been able to see them live. I‚Äôm starting to believe that the universe has something against me. ",phish,1539165696,JheriGarcya,17,1,True,2018-10-10

Some Things I'd Love to See During Fall Tour,"Despite somewhat of a weird vibe around the scene (really mostly on facebook/reddit) this summer, I thought there were definite steps forward. For the first time since 2009, I think first sets were the strong point of summer. Many shows had big first set jams (ie Alpharetta Ghost), good song placement (ie Dick's Down with Disease in the 1.2 slot rather than the standard 2.1 slot), and the introduction of some cool toys. This summer, more than any other in the 24 years I've been seeing em, I noticed the lack of bust-outs, rarities, and one-offs from deep in the catalogue. Can't remember the last time they didn't play Scent of a Mule during a tour. Mellow Mood was the only real bustout that I can think of this summer. Not a big deal, just an observation...but some songs were in really tight rotation. For fall, I'd love for them to continue what they did this summer...continue the big first set jams. I'd like to see maybe a little more variation in setlists, maybe more long-form jamming, and definitely a looser rotation of songs with some bust-outs and rarities tossed in the mix. Lastly, and I know it's a stretch, but I'd love for Trey to use that wah pedal a bit. Looking forward to the 10 shows I'm hitting, sure to be lots of great moments. I'm also happy to say that I'm keeping my Hampton streak alive -- I haven't missed a single Hampton show they've ever done! \*\*WHAT ARE SOME THINGS YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THEM DO THIS FALL?\*\*",phish,1539217876,ski4theapres,17,1,True,2018-10-10
"I can't believe it, but your boys hooked a long time ""hater"" and I'm pretty sure I'm a phan now.","Hey guys just thought I'd share this with you all on here. I'm a long time head from a family of heads, and well I've never really enjoyed phish because I've always had this preconceived notion that they were just a goofy weird band, and I found the vocals and lyrics to be really off putting. The few times friends tried to play some Phish for me it never really clicked and I can honestly say I was probably pretty high brow and douchey about it. I'm a humble enough guy to admit that I was dead wrong and I feel pretty embarrassed that I've always looked down on them for some unjustified reason. 


     It started months ago when I started a new job were I spend 3-4 hours driving per day. It also lined up with me getting unlimited data for my phone, and streaming random and new music while driving. Driving one day Blaze On came on and I really dug it, it was followed by Possum, Piper, and Mellow Mood. While listening to this ""new band"" it put me in such a great mood, and my jaw nearly dropped when I got home and checked out the band I've been listening too. (I get bad anxiety from a accident years back so I never take my eyes off the road) It was Phish. I was listening to fucking Phish and I fucking LOVED it. I listened to the summer 2015 tour for weeks falling more in love.


     Fast forward to the present day and I've been listening to Phish nearly every day for 3 hours a day. All of my previous thoughts about this band have gone out the window and I've realized that I just never gave them on honest chance. All my thoughts about vocals and lyrics have changed once I realized that the vocals are nothing more then a simple vehicle to propel jams and the music forward. Every song doesn't need to have deep meaningful lyrics and its honesty some of the best music I've ever heard. A bad day at work can easily be fixed within 1 or 2 songs. 

     I'm going to stop my rant here, but I get it. I get you guys. I get the music. I get the community. And I get the band.

PSOTD #94,"
Wolfman's Brother is written by Phish and Tom Marshall. It debuted on [1994/04/04](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-april-04-1994-the-flynn-theatre-burlington-vt-usa.html). The song recounts the events surrounding Trey's first meeting with Jon Fishman. Here's [a photograph of Fish](https://mrminer.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/phish-1.jpg) from 1991, so you can only imagine what he was walking around looking like a few years earlier. The band struggled with the song from it's debut. After the [1994/06/24](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-26-1994-municipal-auditorium-charleston-wv-usa.html?highlight=683) show it was shelved for 88 shows. This would turn out to be the longest gap in the songs history. Starting in March 1997 the song would double in size and really step into it's own. This trend would continue into 1998 where it would stay on the cutting edge of exploratory Phish jams. The song came back down to earth in 1999 but would be featured (along with four other Phish songs) during a four night Phil and Friends stand in April 1999. The song continued in regular rotation until the first hiatus. 2003-2004 saw the song return for eleven attempts. The return of Phish in 2009 also meant the return of Wolfman's although the song wouldn't see the same 30-minute heights it had in the mid-late 90's. The song is usually found in the first set. Today we'll be [coming down on](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fO1_iByQhrS0CLskIM3LKIQGuzDwlRlz/view) the [1998/10/31](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-october-31-1998-thomas-mack-center-las-vegas-nv-usa.html?highlight=683) version that opened up a three song second set. It also features Fishman on the vacuum, which is something we're yet to talk about but will get to eventually.

Statistics:            
Wolfman's Brother was played at 10.8% of live Phish shows.            
It was last played September 1, 2018, which was 1 shows ago.            
There have been 979 shows since the live debut.                           
Wolfman's Brother has been played approximately once every 9.3 shows.                
Since its debut, Wolfman's Brother has been played, on average, once every 5 shows.               
It was played 196 times.

Contact the Attorney General and complain about TM unfair trade practices.,"The only way Ticketmaster has a chance of being brought to justice is if we make this known by the state. It wont hurt to pick up the phone for 30 seconds and leave a message. Power in numbers maybe we can make a change who knows, but we cant make it worse. 

I saw this copy/paste on another post about this but something should be said along the lines of this. 

If you want to do something productive, contact your states Attorney General and let them know how wonderful Ticketmaster is instead.

Here's what I sent, feel free to copy/paste it if you'd like:

‚ÄúIt has been proven time and time again that Ticketmaster is fixing the secondary ticket market in conjunction with StubHub (a TM owned company) and other secondary marketplaces, including their own platinum tickets. They've already lost a class action lawsuit and were forced to pay a massive fine and give a huge number of tickets back to consumers as compensation. Now more lawsuits have been brought against Ticketmaster in both the US and Canada. However these have already been proven useless, as the last one did not stop Ticketmaster from charging up to 40% of the value of a ticket in fees, and withholding large numbers of tickets to scalp at 300%. They need to be targeted at the state level for effective action to take place.

Please consider using the powers of your office to investigate and prosecute Ticketmaster and their monopoly.‚Äù",phish,1539366487,susfux,8,1,True,2018-10-12

An interesting data project concept related to NYE tickets,"It would be really neat to actually calculate the true market value of NYE tickets over time. This wouldn't be possible, even on a rough scale, without access to about 8 years of mostly complete price records for primary and secondary ticket prices, attempted number of individuals who tried to purchase unsuccessfully, and dollar value adjustments. It would also be interesting to add things like adjusted cost of travel and lodging, distance travelled to get to the shows, and SES statistics for phans who actually go to multi-night runs other than NYE. 

Are there any data scientists or economists who want to weigh in and add/remove other categories that would be needed to calibrate a model? Again, this isn't something that would be possible given lack of access to data sets, but it is a neat thought experiment. ",phish,1539373746,Jimlish,0,1,True,2018-10-12

CashOrTrade Vent,"This web site, CashOrTrade is just so frustrating and unfair.

The whole idea is selling extra tickets for face value.  So I have some extra Hamptons and I go to sell them.  For face value, the whole point of the site.

When I start looking at the postings, I see Hamptons are selling for half price.  One guy offers $50 for my 3-day ticket, which cost me over $250.  

So I am really baffled, are free markets and capitalism good and useful when market prices are below face value, but not so when market prices are above face value?  I am going to lose $500 on my Hamptons.  Why would I possibly want to sell an extra hot ticket I have on that site instead of making a few bucks on StubHub?  I am not a Wook charity.  If I am expected to sell my hot tickets at cost, I expect to be paid cost on my less hot tickets.

Saw It Again is written by Trey and Tom and made it's Phish debut on [1997/06/14](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-14-1997-the-sfx-centre-dublin-ireland.html). The song itself was first performed by New York! on 1997/05/21. New York! was a project that featured Mike and Trey. Saw It Again is a sufficiently [spooky](https://media.giphy.com/media/R7mR1YmHaOwlW/giphy.gif) song about waking up in the middle of the night with the feeling that somethings in your window. In your state of near hysteria you approach the window and see the shape of the being you fear. That's when the curtain's blow open revealing your own reflection. The music consists largely of heavy bass bombs from Mike and ripping guitar from Trey to help set the mood of being frightened. The song averages in at five to seven minutes. Saw It Again got a slight refresher from the 2014 Chilling, Thrilling Show sound affects. A lot of times at the end of the song Page will hit the creaking house sounds or the sound of a person screaming. Some other songs have received similar treatment with various affects and honestly, I kind of like it.

In it's debut year of 1997 Saw It Again had seven attempts. It wasn't played at all in 1998. 1999, 2000 and 2003 saw three performances. The song was not seen in 2004. With the return of the band many fans (myself included) wondered if we'd ever see it again. The question was answered on [2010/06/27](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-27-2010-merriweather-post-pavilion-columbia-md-usa.html) when the band played the song twice and referenced the lyrics in five other songs during the show. From there the song would make it's regular one or two yearly appearances, with the exception of 2016 when the song was played five times. Saw It Again usually can be found in the first set although it's not uncommon for it to be played in the second set. Today we're going to get [fully awoken](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G8jShBCHZHzU9iX5Dg6DFhzfgp2iUUgs/view) to the [1997/07/01](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-01-1997-paradiso-amsterdam-netherlands.html?highlight=282) performance.

BBFCFM is a song written by Mike and sung by Mike with the rest of the band providing backing vocals. The song debuted on [1987/08/21](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-21-1987-ian-mcleans-farm-hebron-ny-usa.html). The song opens with some metal rage followed by Mike asking ""Why are you running?"". There's a brief pause and the band responds with the repeated refrain of ""Cause your a big black furry creature from Mars"". There a second pause with Fishman usually counting out 1-2-3-4 just before the band dives back into the initial metal. Up until 1996 the song would feature a lot of dry ice, strobe lights and Trey running around swinging his guitar or megaphone. The song frequently features teases of a television theme including, but not limited to, Flintstones, Leave it to Beaver and The Brady Bunch. Several shows have also featured multiple appearances by the song, the most notable of which is [2003/07/15](http://www.phish.net/setlists/phish-july-15-2003-usana-amphitheatre-west-valley-city-ut-usa.html) when the song was interwoven with Buried Alive, Ha Ha Ha and Mr. Completely.

The song was performed very, very frequently up until the end of 1995. It saw just two performances in 1996, one in 1997, two in 1998, one in 1999 and one in 2000. The lone performance after the first hiatus came in 2003. The bands return in 2009  saw a relative uptick in performances of the song. 2010 leads the pack with four performances. Since 2014, however, the song has been performed once per year. The song has also been performed on Halloween proper four times (1987, 1990, 2010 and 2014). Historically the song is usually a late set affair with the majority of performances coming in the second or third set and the encore. Since 2012 the song has been played exclusively in the first set.

The LivePhish iPhone app has been terrible for a long time yet I keep paying for it.,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong. That LivePhish even exists is one of the things I love about the band.

Phish Thoughts,"So, I'm going to preface this by saying I've been a 
long time phan, been to about 30 shows, and have 
spent considerable time and money seeing and 
supporting them over the last 15 years. My best 
bud and I were having a really in depth discussion 
about the way the fan base idolizes the band, and 
this led to some perspective changes on a number
of issues and I wanted to  get some feedback if 
anyone else has considered these things.

First of all, I think a lot of what makes up a band 
(the individual personalities, the ethics, the
motives, and the collective stance) get lost on a lot 
of the fans in the whirlwind of idolatry. I am guilty 
of this as well, which is why I'm putting this out 
there. It's important to continue to hold your 
heroes to the same standards as your closest 
friends.

The first thing that struck me is the ""prank"" that 
Trey did in college with the hand and heart. 
Regardless of whether it was a human or goat 
heart, the very notion he would send some severed organs to someone and consider it a joke 
is troubling and shows a lot of privilege. It's in such 
bad taste that if a friend of mine thought to do 
that and expected me to laugh it off, I would cut 
them right out of my life for good. This has tones 
of sociopathy and not giving a flying fuck about 
the deceased and defiling their dignity. Just think 
about it on an emotional level - would you really 
think that's an okay thing to do? Would you just 
write that off as your friend being their crazy self? 
I would be concerned for their mental health. The 
fact that he still refers to it as a joke makes it 
worse in my view - he doesn't see it as a big deal 
and 30+ years to reflect on it hasn't taught him 
anything about the way people should or shouldn't behave.

The second thing - Trey's drug addiction. He had 
every example of what not do to from looking at 
Jerry's life and all the various other artists who 
went down that path, and yet he went right ahead 
and did it anyway. He also was not faithful to his 
wife while out on tour, and I think some of this 
attitude came from Zappa's way of life, which was 
also extremely questionable. If you look at some of 
the footage that shows Zappa hanging out in a 
house full of groupies and a very young 
Dweezil seemingly being raised by them while on 
the road, it paints a bad picture and explains a lot 
of the trouble that exists in the Zappa family now 
between Dweezil and Ahmet. Zappa was also 
completely unapologetic for this lifestyle, and 
while he did manage to accomplish more than 
almost any other single composer in recent 
history, every other part of his life had to suffer for 
it. I think Trey either consciously or 
subconsciously gleaned some of these traits from Zappa and was himself a victim of idolatry without 
consideration for the real-world implications of 
these kinds of actions. The only reason he stopped 
with the heroin is because he was being extremely 
careless and got himself arrested, otherwise I'm 
not sure he'd be alive today. Either way, it shows 
disregard for the consequences to the band and 
his family, which is not something to be admired.

Thirdly, I take issue with the fact they are still 
incessantly touring, even at the point where they 
have won the game and made their millions, but 
they aren't pushing themselves to write creatively or get deep into improv like they used to. Add on 
top of this the fact they are selling $6k all-
inclusive resort tickets to Mexico, and it really 
makes me question what the hell they are 
doing anymore and what the point is to keep 
going. They all have families now, and I'm sure 
whether the family tags along or stays home, they 
would prefer to have their fathers around more 
instead of chasing more and more money and a 
bigger fan base. I found Big Boat to be a definitive statement of the band's lack of trying lately. Most 
of the songs on there are completely awful and 
out of character, with maybe one or two 
exceptions. Joy and Fuego were great examples of 
them finding ways to be creative without having to churn out progressive jam opuses like in the early days. It would be a different story if they decided 
to play for the benefit of charity, like in the Mexico 
shows if the proceeds from the exorbitant ticket 
prices went to the surrounding areas living in 
abject poverty. But I don't see this as a 
consideration from them, which makes me really 
think it's all about the money at this point.

And finally, it's important to consider what a band 
pushes out into the world with their message. The 
more I look at Phish songs and lyrics, while many 
of them are very beautiful and poetic, they don't 
really convey a sense of being in touch with 
what's going on in the world. In fact, it seems that 
with Gamehendge and many of the lyrics, they are 
mostly focused on fantasy and escapism and 
directing the listener away from the happenings of 
the world. Contrast this with Robert Hunter and 
the Dead, they were single-handedly carrying a 
cultural revolution and their lyrics are very mindful 
of what was happening at the time, while also 
being highly poetic and ethereal. Jerry also 
maintained that he and the band shouldn't be 
followed blindly and treated as gods (Estimated 
Prophet), while Trey himself has repeatedly said 
that if he can help someone forget about the 
problems in the world for a few hours, then he 
feels he has done his part. I disagree, mainly 
because when you're as big of an influence as he 
is, there is a certain responsibility to engage the 
listener and encourage them to be mindful and 
involved in the world rather than escaping it. This is reflected in the fact that the first 15 years or so of the band's existence were basically an 
ever-expanding drug party and I think this has 
shaped a lot of what the current jam scene lacks - 
critical thinking and self-awareness. It's this kind 
of environment that births bands like Twiddle, 
where they can put in 1/10th the effort of writing 
music that the Dead and Phish have and can still 
become huge. And before you jump at the chance 
to call me a hater, really consider the depth of 
their content and their message (if any) - can you 
honestly say Twiddle stands for something? Can 
you honestly say they really try to push anything 
innovative out there? It's watered down, derivative 
millennial jam music with atrocious singing, and it 
was created on the shoulders of giants by copying 
their formula. 

Overall, I think the band has diverged from my own 
sense of ethics and while their music will always 
hold a special place in my heart, it feels different 
thinking of things in this way. I also look back on 
the thousands and thousands I've spent following 
them around and wonder what more productive 
use I could have gotten from that time and money. 
At the time, I was loving every minute of it and I 
did make some great memories, but ultimately I 
got swept up in the scene and wasn't thinking 
towards my future. I was only concerned with how 
to get to the next show and I think this obsessive 
attitude is very misguided and does some subtle 
damage when you're sorting it out later on. It 
doesn't help that everyone in the scene is 
concerned with stats and getting more shows 
under their belt than the next guy. I don't think 
this is what it should be about and there are so 
many criminally under-appreciated artists out 
there trying to make a living - why not diversify 
and support those acts as well instead of using all 
my efforts supporting one band that ultimately 
doesn't even feel the impact of my presence or 
contribution?

I don't expect many people to agree with me here 
- these are just the conclusions I have arrived at 
through a deeper look into their history. I'm happy 
to discuss any part of this and I'm open to
information that may prove me wrong on any 
accounts. Cheers. ",phish,1539542204,Grand-wazoo,1,1,True,2018-10-14
Some Considerations on Phish,"So I'm going to preface this by saying I've been a long time phan, been to about 30 shows, and have spent considerable time¬†and¬†money seeing and supporting them over the last 15 years. My best bud and I were having a really in depth discussion¬†about the way¬†the fan base idolizes the band, and this led to some perspective changes on a number of issues and I wanted to¬†get some feedback¬†if anyone else has considered these things.

  
First of all, I think a lot of what makes up a band (the individual personalities, the ethics, the motives, and the collective¬†stance) get¬†lost on a lot of the fans in the whirlwind of idolatry. I am guilty of this as well, which is why I'm putting this out¬†there. It's important¬†to continue to hold your heroes to the same standards as your closest friends.

  
The first thing that struck me is the ""prank"" that Trey did in college with the hand and heart. Regardless of whether it was a¬†human¬†or goat heart, the very notion he would send some severed organs to someone and consider it a joke is troubling and¬†shows a lot of¬†privilege. It's in such bad taste that if a friend of mine thought to do that and expected me to laugh it off, I¬†would cut them right out¬†of my life for good. This has tones of sociopathy and not giving a flying fuck about the deceased¬†and defiling their dignity. Just think¬†about it on an emotional level - would you really think that's an okay thing to do? Would¬†you just write that off as your friend being¬†their crazy self? I would be concerned for their mental health. The fact that he still¬†refers to it as a joke makes it worse in my view -¬†he doesn't see it as a big deal and 30+ years to reflect on it hasn't taught him¬†anything about the way people should or shouldn't¬†behave.

  
The second thing - Trey's drug addiction. He had every example of what not do to from looking at Jerry's life and all the¬†various¬†other artists who went down that path, and yet he went right ahead and did it anyway. He also was not faithful to his¬†wife while out¬†on tour, and I think some of this attitude came from Zappa's way of life, which was also extremely¬†questionable. If you look at some¬†of the footage that shows Zappa hanging out in a house full of groupies and a very young¬†Dweezil seemingly being raised by them¬†while on the road, it paints a bad picture and explains a lot of the trouble that exists¬†in the Zappa family now between Dweezil and¬†Ahmet. Zappa was also completely unapologetic for this lifestyle, and while¬†he did manage to accomplish more than almost any¬†other single composer in recent history, every other part of his life had to¬†suffer for it. I think Trey either consciously or¬†subconsciously gleaned some of these traits from Zappa and was himself a¬†victim of idolatry without consideration for the real-world implications of these kinds of actions. The only reason he stopped¬†with the heroin is because he was being extremely¬†careless and got himself arrested, otherwise I'm not sure he'd be alive¬†today. Either way, it shows disregard for the consequences¬†to the band and his family, which is not something to be admired.

  
Thirdly, I take issue with the fact they are still incessantly touring, even at the point where they have won the game and made¬†their¬†millions, but they aren't pushing themselves to write creatively or get deep into improv like they used to. Add on top of¬†this the fact¬†they are selling $6k all-inclusive resort tickets to Mexico, and it really makes me question what the hell they are¬†doing anymore and¬†what the point is to keep going. They all have families now, and I'm sure whether the family tags along or¬†stays home, they would¬†prefer to have their fathers around more instead of chasing more and more money and a bigger fan¬†base. I found Big Boat to be a¬†definitive statement of the band's lack of trying lately. Most of the songs on there arecompletely awful and out of character, with¬†maybe one or two exceptions. Joy and Fuego were great examples of them¬†finding ways to be creative without having to churn out¬†progressive jam opuses like in the early days. It would be a different¬†story if they decided to play for the benefit of charity, like in¬†the Mexico shows if the proceeds from the exorbitant ticket¬†prices went to the surrounding areas living in abject poverty. But I don't¬†see this as a consideration from them, which makes¬†me really think it's all about the money at this point.

  
And finally, it's important to consider what a band pushes out into the world with their message. The more I look at Phish¬†songs and¬†lyrics, while many of them are very beautiful and poetic, they don't really convey a sense of being in touch with¬†what's going on in¬†the world. In fact, it seems that with Gamehendge and many of the lyrics, they are mostly focused on¬†fantasy and escapism and¬†directing the listener away from the happenings of the world. Contrast this with Robert Hunter and¬†the Dead, they were single-handedly carrying a cultural revolution and their lyrics are very mindful of what was happening at¬†the time, while also being highly¬†poetic and ethereal. Jerry also maintained that he and the band shouldn't be followed blindly¬†and treated as gods (Estimated¬†Prophet), while Trey himself has repeatedly said that if he can help someone forget about the¬†problems in the world for a few¬†hours, then he feels he has done his part. I disagree, mainly because when you're as big of an¬†influence as he is, there is a certain¬†responsibility to engage the listener and encourage them to be mindful and involved in the¬†world rather than escaping it. This is¬†reflected in the fact that the first 15 years or so of the band's existence were basically an¬†ever-expanding drug party and I think this¬†has shaped a lot of what the current jam scene lacks - critical thinking and self-awareness. It's this kind of environment that births¬†bands like Twiddle, where they can put in 1/10th the effort of writing¬†music that the Dead and Phish have and can still become¬†huge. And before you jump at the chance to call me a hater, really¬†consider the depth of their content and their message (if any) -¬†can you honestly say Twiddle stands for something? Can you¬†honestly say they really try to push anything innovative out there? It's¬†watered down, derivative millennial jam music with¬†atrocious singing, and it was created on the shoulders of giants by copying their formula.¬†

Odd request; would anyone have a drawing/picture of something associated with the lyrics from Fuego?,"I'm trying to throw together together a goofy image  on Photoshop, which portrays some of the lyrics or a ""scene"" from Fuego - doesn't matter which section  of lyrics from the song, but preferably something that can depict  imagery easier  over some of the lyrics that don't accomplish this task as much (think ""viking warriors with animal heads"" vs   ""I asked Diego if it was stolen"").

I have a hard time getting the creative side of my brain working until I find something I can work off of, and I'm trying to put together a simple image on Photoshop that portrays some section of this song (or a ""scene"" from the song, I like to put it). I looked online to see if anyone has  drawings or pictures in reference to this song, but nothing  - hand drawing, computer drawing, whatever. I looked up images on google to see if I could work off something off that, such as a drawing of viking warriors with animal heads, but still couldn't find anything.

I know this is an odd request. Does anyone have any pictures or drawings they could link/show me that somewhat references any of the lyrics from this song?!

In Nashville we are going to be playing Cedar Hill the morning of October 24th. I plan on starting around 11 AM for both days, so dont party too hard the night before, or do, I'm not your dad.

Welcome to Phish: A Guide for Beginners,"*Over the years, I've been asked by several friends to help them get into Phish (and been mostly successful, although Phish themselves should rightfully take the credit on that). On the eve of Fall Tour 2018, I thought I would compile and edit information and advice from various emails I've sent in this effort. Hopefully this will be helpful to some of you - feel free to hit me up with suggestions or corrections if anything seems off. Here goes:*

Dear friend,

I hope this message finds you well. Contained within it is a rather large amount of information, but you need not process it all at once. You are about to embark upon a fantastical journey, and like all good journeys, there is no ""right"" way to go about it. As you progress down this rabbit-hole, my words can act as one guide, but you will find that, as always, your truest guide is your own taste and curiosity. Also, as extensive as this message is, it will be impossible to fit in everything, so there will be much more to explore.

In general, I would advise not to overthink it too much (I know, it's hard), not get too overwhelmed by the volume of content, and just dive in and start swimming!

To quote their song [""AC/DC Bag""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCdQ5R5IgP4) - ""Let's get down to the nitty-gritty! Let's get this show on the road!""

**Basics**

Phish is a phenomenal band, and I mean that literally. There are other jam bands, and others that they are often compared to, but there is only one Phish. I can say without hyperbole that they are four of the most talented musicians and composers out there, and I doubt even Phish-haters would deny their technical chops (they would just state that Phish uses those incredible technical chops to make terrible music, but to each their own...). Like any band that's been around for 30+ years, they have gone through many phases and sounds, and you'll definitely find ones you like better than others.

A great way to get into Phish is to explore both their songs and their famous improvisational jams. In the live setting, the two are usually paired together - a song serves as a springboard into an extended jam. Many songs can be best discovered through their studio albums, which usually forego any long jams. Their songs run the gamut: rock to blues to funk to progressive to modern classical. They are amazing composers who take inspiration from Hendrix, Zappa, the Beatles, the Talking Heads, and many others. Many of their lyrics are very quirky and bizarre, and yet if you listen enough, you'll probably find many weird truisms.

They're also the world's best cover band. They've covered everyone from the Stones to Bill Monroe to TV on the Radio. And they always make the songs their own. In addition, they have a longstanding tradition of performing shows on Halloween in which they don a ""musical costume"" and cover a classic album in its entirety (beginning in 1994 with The Beatles' White Album and most recently in 2016 doing David Bowie's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars).

**History**

Phish formed in Burlington, Vermont in 1983. They've had the same lineup since 1985:

* Trey Anastasio - Guitar
* Jon Fishman - Drums
* Mike Gordon - Bass
* Page McConnell - Keyboards

Their evolution has been profound and constant, with dramatic shifts in style across years and even tours. Generally speaking, 94-98 is considered their strongest period, but there's greatness to be found across their entire career. There are a few hard barriers (relating to the hiatus from 2000-2002 and break-up from 2004-2009) and much overlap, but to roughly summarize their eras:

**1.0**

1983-89: Formative years - from college band to local bar band to regional (Northeast) touring band. Sometimes loose, in-jokey, and juvenile, but with a hunger and energy that clearly points towards something greater.

90-92: Relentless touring of the national club circuit. Fast, aggressive playing. Developing a cult following and building a reputation as a must-see band.

93-96: Shifting towards an emphasis on long-form improvisation and exploration. Growing from small clubs to medium venues, then exploding into arena-size shows. The massive influx of fans from the Grateful Dead scene following Jerry Garcia's death in August 95 fundamentally changed the atmosphere of shows and trajectory of their career.

97-2000: More of a focus on funk, rhythm, texture, and groove. Contains many career highlights (including Fall 97 aka the ""Phish Destroys America"" tour, Spring 98's 4-show ""Island Tour,"" and their New Years 99-2000 festival at Big Cypress in Florida wherein they welcomed the new millennium by playing a nonstop 7-hour midnight-to-sunrise set). In the fall of 2000, the band announced they were taking a hiatus, and stopped playing together until New Years 2002-03.

**2.0**

2003-04: Return from hiatus. Colloquially known as ""The Oxy Years,"" this era was the height of drugs and the party scene on-, off-, and backstage. Forgotten lyrics, flubbed compositions, and mistaken notes galore, but also some of the most exploratory and emotional jams. The beast that was Phish Inc. became too large and unwieldy to manage, and due to a combination of financial issues, drug addiction, and intra-band tensions, they broke up (apparently for good) following their Coventry festival in 2004.

**3.0**

2009-Present: In 2006, Trey was arrested in upstate New York for a DWI, and was found to be in possession of prescription opiates. He went to drug court and rehab, and finished treatment in 2008 (becoming an outspoken advocate for compassionate drug laws and rehabilitation since). Shortly thereafter, he began writing new music and reached out to the other members of Phish to reunite. They played their first show of the current era in March 2009, and have been playing consistently since then. In terms of sound and style, this era is marked by a more mature, direct, and egalitarian approach to improvisation. 2015 was a highlight year, with Trey joining the living members of the Grateful Dead for their ""Fare Thee Well"" concerts, and the accompanying practice and focus translated over to Phish, producing some of their greatest musical moments in recent memory. In 2017, they staged ""The Bakers Dozen,"" a 13-night residency at Madison Square Garden in which each show had a unique setlist with no repeats, performing over 230 songs over the course of the run.

**Music/Performance**

The proper format to experience Phish is to attend a live show. I realize this may be difficult for you in the near future, but definitely put it on your to-do list. If possible, find a friend to attend with you, but if not, don't worry about rolling solo - you'll make plenty of friends at the show :)

Aside from seeing them live in front of your face, there are the recordings. Every Phish show is recorded either professionally or by fans (and most of these fan recordings are with professional equipment and of the highest quality). The official place to check these out is http://www.livephish.com/ (soundboards direct from the band), and audience recordings for all shows can be streamed for free at www.phish.in There's also plenty of good stuff on YouTube and the like. A good place to start with live shows is the mid- to late-90s ('96-'99 or so). They got super funky and melodic then, and it'll be really easy to get into. From there, you can move backwards or forwards as you like.

Their studio albums are good, but are mostly useful for familiarizing yourself with various songs and stylistic periods. My favorite studio albums are as follows: Story of the Ghost (1998), Hoist (1994), Rift (1993), Junta (1989), Farmhouse (2000), although that's just my personal preference (Ghost, Hoist, and Rift and pretty universally loved by phans, Junta is their first album and contains some of their best songs, and Farmhouse is kinda poppy/divisive but I like it a lot). Here's the wiki article of their discography http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phish_discography

Also, they have active YouTube and Vimeo accounts with tons of amazing videos. One thing you'll probably notice, if you haven't already, is their lights are fucking crazy. They always have a massive light rig and the man who's been their lighting designer for 25 years, Chris Kuroda, is widely considered to be a pseudo 5th member of the band. He is always in sync with them and often uses the lights to help influence the jams (sets different moods with colors and patterns, which the band translates into different keys, melodies and rhythms). The videos will give you a sense of what I'm talking about, but seeing it live is definitely the way to go. It's pretty uncanny.

**Advice/Recommendations/Resources**

So that was a lot - where to go from here?

Here are some resources that will prove invaluable in your research:

- The official site (news, tour dates, official releases, etc) http://phish.com/
- The largest phan site (encyclopedic collection of setlists, song histories with recommended performances, blog posts, message boards, etc) http://phish.net/
- Free streaming site phish.in
- Official YouTube and Vimeo profiles https://www.youtube.com/user/phish https://vimeo.com/phish 
- The Phish subreddit http://www.reddit.com/r/phish
- Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, etc all have large collections of studio albums and official live releases

As I said before, your best guide will be your own taste and curiosity. A good approach that worked well for me and others I've brought into the fold is to: 1) Dive in and listen to a show. 2) Pick a song you really liked from that show and look it up on phish.net 3) Pick a recommended version from that song's history. 4) Listen to that entire show. 5) Repeat, either with another version of that song or another song you liked from that show.

This way, your exposure grows organically, and you can appreciate the variations in performances of a single song as well as changes in style and sound across years.

To help you get started, here is a Spotify playlist full of some of my favorite shows, as well as their studio albums:

https://open.spotify.com/user/1235530512/playlist/3Wqg14MKQTuAoxgQAahMwK

I organized them in an order that I think highlights the diversity of styles from each era, but feel free to skip around. I'll break each show down to give you a bit more guidance:

**12/1/95** - A great starter show. The opening frame of Buried Alive &gt; Down with Disease &gt; Theme from the Bottom highlights Phish's ability to manage energy and flow.

**11/17/97** - One of my personal all-time favorites. Almost every song is a highlight and landmark version, but especially the Tweezer, Ghost (contender for my favorite Phish jam ever), Johnny B Goode -&gt; Jam, and YEM.

**6/14/00** - In 99 and 2000, Phish did short tours in Japan where they played small clubs. The more intimate settings led to mellower, more ambient textural jams. The Twist-&gt;Jam here is legendary. Rumor has it the boys drank mushroom tea before this show (they were legal in Japan at the time).

**2/28/03** - 2003 and 2004 comprise what is referred to as Phish 2.0 - the band broke up briefly from 2001-2002 and 2005-2009. The era prior to the first breakup is 1.0, in between the breakups is 2.0, and the current era is 3.0. Phish 2.0 is marked by a darkness more prevalent than in the other eras (drug use and intra-band tension were at their highest levels during these years), but there are still gems to be found amongst the rough. Highlights of this show include Birds, Gin, Tweezer, and Hood.

**4/2/98-4/5/98** - This run of shows is referred to as ""The Island Tour,"" since the concerts took place in Long Island and Rhode Island. Funky, catchy, goofy, and playful, this is peak Phish. Highlights: 4/2 Twist, 4/3 Mike's &gt; Old Home Place &gt; Weekapaug, 4/3 Roses Are Free -&gt; Jam -&gt; Piper, 4/4 Birds &amp; 2001, and 4/5 Disease &amp; Cavern.

**7/6/98** - Similar to their 99 &amp; 2000 Japan runs, in 97 &amp; 98 they did a string of small club shows in Europe. This one from Prague features a blistering Ghost with a buttery smooth transition into a cover of the Talking Heads' Cities.

**12/7/97** - Just an all-around great show from start to finish. One of the strongest first sets they've ever played, with perfect transitions in the opening Bag -&gt; Psycho Killer -&gt; JJLC, an extra-funky Tube, and a gorgeous Slave to the Traffic Light.

**12/31/95** - An epic New Years show, their second at MSG. Nonstop energy and virtuosity. I could list highlights, but then I'd just type out the entire setlist.

I also included their studio albums: **Junta** (1989), **Lawn Boy** (1990), **A Picture of Nectar** (1992), **Rift** (1993), **Hoist** (1994), **Billy Breathes** (1996), **Story of the Ghost** (1998), **Farmhouse** (2000), **Round Room** (2003), **Undermind** (2004), **Joy** (2009), **Fuego** (2014), and **Big Boat** (2016), as well as **A Live One** (1995), which contains curated performances from their 1994 tour arranged to resemble the flow of a real show.

Even though this seems like a lot, hopefully this information is helpful and makes it a little less overwhelming. As ridiculous as it may seem, this is only scratching the surface, and I had to edit my choices down a lot. I didn't even provide you with anything pre-1994, and some of the best stuff is in 90-93 when they were so young and hungry. I also didn't include any 3.0 shows on the playlist, but those are worth exploring as well (Fall 13, Summer 14, Summer 15, and Summer 17 are all excellent tours - definitely listen to all of their 2015 festival [Magnaball](http://phish.in/2015-08-21) and the 2017 MSG residency [The Bakers Dozen](http://bakersdozen.nyc/)).

And I didn't even mention [Gamehendge](http://phish.net/faq/gamehendge)...

Am I listening to a different Dicks Night 3 than everyone else?,"I'm a little confused. Me and my small crew were geeking out Sunday night, second set, at the slow pace Phish found, similar to the Ghost&gt;Crosseyed from N1, that I thought kind of turned that whole 46 Days&gt;Tweez&gt;Golden Age&gt;Steam into some of my favorite Phish of this summer.

It seems like the majority of the reviews are pretty negative. I thought it was as good as Night 1, and I think Night 3 set 2 was the best set of music of the weekend from to back.

The slow weird cowbell pace gave way to some creative new types of jamming. Maybe nothing went 20 minutes but I honestly thought the highly lauded Night 1 Set 2 they went too far out with nothing really to play, whereas this night everything seemed to be inspired with the intentions of trying something new and different.

I get if you're a perfectionist and some of the ""flubs"" or rough parts while the band found their groove turned you off, but I dont get how you could think the set was standard.

The pace out of Tweez was perfect for Golden Age - I usually hate that song but with a slow and funky Mike beat holding it down, the song was a completely different animal. I also heard essentially a full band Manteca tease throughout the Tweez&gt;Golden Age transition.

Maybe it didnt show up on the stream but it just felt extremely unique and not like the let down everyone's making it out to be.",phish,1536113365,bruiserbrody45,62,33,True,2018-09-04

So I went to Phish Dick‚Äôs this weekend..,"So, as the title states I attended Phish Dick‚Äôs this weekend and I sure am glad I did. You see I‚Äôm a Deadhead who never had crossed streams, so I figured I would give them a listen and if I liked what I heard I would attend PD. Well, I loved what I heard and bought the tickets to take the ride, but the ride got fucking bumpy. I was diagnosed with Leukemia last year and it was obviously a wake up moment, but everything was going well with treatments and we thought we would just cruise into remission  - so fast forward to Phish Dick‚Äôs week and I get a call from my doc saying that the cancer is worse and we have to go back to the drawing board. So, tests were ordered etc... I was devastated and absolutely fucking wrecked, but I was still looking forward to the shows and just spacing out for a few nights. And I could not have asked for better medicine. The shows catapulted me into a stratosphere of joy. I just remember Night 2 watching 2001 and I just couldn‚Äôt stop smiling.  Watching all the glow-sticks flying and the ever-moving crowd took me exactly where I wanted to be, but I got so much more than just a great show. I met so many great people that wanted to make sure I enjoyed myself and the music and at one point I just stood looking at the lot and just fucking cried because of how heavy the positive vibes were and how much I realized I needed this weekend. I truly needed these shows and this band more than I ever knew, but at this point the band and the shows were just the cherries on top. It was the people and the community that lifted me up and for that I am forever grateful. So I just want to thank you all and say I hope to see you all many, many more times on the road.

Let's have a chat about audio only streams being attacked.,I mean some of us are barely scraping by and want to share in the groove.  Some of us stream mixlr while we are at work. Why would we pay for a live video feed that we could never get any use of.  Most of us die hard phans have spent thousands buying tickets and CDs and supporting these guys everywhere we can.  I have seen Phish in at least 20 states.  We dont all have funds to buy streams to every show but I like to listen to every show they play live.

Notes on Attending a Phish Concert for the First Time,"1. Beautiful Weirdos. The ethos at a Phish concert is ‚Äúcome as you are.‚Äù Before the show, the parking lot of The Forum, in Inglewood, where the Lakers used to play, resembles the set of a Fellini movie grafted onto an ancient Grateful Dead memory. All clothing and barbering choices are acceptable. Smiling at strangers allowed. Dancing for no reason strongly encouraged. People who attend Phish concerts tend to be uninhibited; the absence of inhibitions makes them beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Traveling Economy. A tribe of Phish-heads tours with the band, selling veggie burritos ‚Äî or grilled cheese, or fruit smoothies, or glass pipes, or art, or handmade clothes, or whatever. The broad avenue of campers and pickups backed up for business is known affectionately as ‚ÄúShakedown Street,‚Äù in homage to the Dead who came before us. Whatever you seek will be found at this carnival-like bazaar, especially if it‚Äôs a consciousness-altering substance. Or if it makes you laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The Nitrous Mafia. For five bucks, you can buy a big round balloon filled with nitrous oxide. The businessmen who own the tanks, one hears, have earned a scurrilous reputation in some quarters. I have not investigated further, other than to perform quality control on their product, which I can report does indeed make one laugh and feel slightly faint and euphoric ‚Äî for a very brief time, maybe a minute. This is why you often see folks at a Phish concert walking around the parking lot with three (or more) balloons in hand.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Fabulous Forum. Old school. A floor and two mezzanines. No corporate skyboxes. No separation between the swaying bodies. No obstructed or partial views. A fabulous place to see a rock concert.

&amp;#x200B;

5. A Seasoned Quartet. Jon, Mike, Page and Trey have been jamming together for something like 35-years; the depth of their groove goes beyond ‚Äútight.‚Äù It‚Äôs a kind of telepathy. Aficionados consider them Phish 3.0; twice before they broke up/went on hiatus. This version, I‚Äôm told, is slightly less rapid-fire virtuosity and more transcendent grooviness. They play appropriately loud, but not punishingly loud. By the rumble in your chest, you know you‚Äôre at a rock concert, but you don‚Äôt need earplugs, and you can actually talk with the person next to you without shouting. Phish music is pleasure music. Pain isn‚Äôt part of it. The band seems happiest when every single person in the arena is up on her feet, dancing his ass off. Singing along. Or not. Having a good time ‚Äî however you define that, so long as no one is harmed ‚Äî is paramount.

&amp;#x200B;

6. CK5. The band‚Äôs lighting designer, Chris Kuroda, is considered ‚Äúthe fifth member of Phish.‚Äù His contributions definitely enhance the sensual experience. His lights don‚Äôt just change colors and move about on mobile rigs, they dance. And at the perfect moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs always coming ‚Äî his lights fall on the audience, illuminating revelers in various stages of ecstasy.

&amp;#x200B;

7. E, L, and Maryjane. Phish is a great band. Their light show is magnificent. The crowd they draw is kind and goodhearted. But surely some measure of the amazingness must be attributed to the splendid effects of mind- and mood-altering drugs like MDMA, mushrooms, and LSD. In addition to dancing for about three hours straight, I spent most of the concert laughing out loud with tears streaming down my face, overwhelmed by the wonderful, marvelous, beautiful absurdity of life, of being human. For one night, I was in on the cosmic joke. And when you need an attitude refresher, cannabis is omnipresent. Joints ‚Äî and pipes, and vape pens ‚Äî get handed around like a collection plate on Sunday. Nothing‚Äôs surreptitious, and no amount of indoor blazing seems to bother the relevant authorities. So, yes, a happy, happy-happy, trippy, trippy-trippy crowd. What would happen if we replaced flouride in our municipal water with trace amounts of LSD? Nothing bad, so far as I can tell.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Encore. Some experiences you‚Äôre glad to have had, but you wouldn‚Äôt choose to repeat. Some you want to repeat every day. I‚Äôm not joining the vagabonds yet, not traveling around the country for camping, raving and dreaming. But the next time Phish is in town, you‚Äôll find me there, effortlessly blending in with my tribe of beautiful weirdos.",phish,1536161066,misterkonik,48,74,True,2018-09-05

Since the last Hampton show she's been diagnosed with Graves Disease and the resulting opthamology has given her extraordinary light sensitivity.

PSOTD #73: The Sloth,"/u/TheSharpestTool posted about potentially having a song of the week thread going on here and it reminded me that's it's been a while since I shamelessly promoted my song of the day email. I just recently wrapped up all of The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday stuff and am going to be moving on to the Gamehedge auxiliary songs. I have a substantial amount of soundboards on my computer and use them curate a daily sampling of Phish. Thanks to /u/asimpleplant making [this post](https://imgur.com/a/LCnLmpF) and abiding by the old rules of B+P I am going to be able to fill in some gaps in my collection. I'd like to cross post the emails to reddit but the fact of the matter is I work twelve hour days. It's easier for me to write them the night before and hit send at six in the morning when I wake up. I send the emails as a blind carbon copy so you won't end up in an email chain and no one but me will see your email. If you want on the train email me at int4rweb@gmail.com. [Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y49kC1A1x5SPPzgF8yh0k-PhKX9zJBMaJ5FG1a8oIv8/edit?usp=sharing) all the songs I've done so far. I repeated TMWSIY because at the time it was just emails from me trying (unsuccessfully) to get my friend into Phish by force feeding him once a day. This is today's effort:

We've reached what is essentially the end of the Trey's senior thesis portion of Gamehedge songs. The actual last song on the project was Possum but since that was covered on PSOTD #36, I will be skipping it. If that was before your time a picture of the write up can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/Uc2UJMe).

When we last left our hero's The Famous Mockingbird had delivered the Helping Friendly Book to Col. Forbins shack. Errand Woolf realizes that he has all the keys he needs to secure power over The Lizards and thus, Gamehedge. With the help of Rutherford he ties up the Famous Mockingbird using glue and rubber bands and sets off to find the one man who can help him eliminate Wilson once and for all: The Sloth ([TMWSIY version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wr7Jibshm-JjyZ-w7jdGlaK_YiPISsse/view) and [final narration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18t_1tOYKmp6TtpFSVPbCxBnzkE04I4Z3/view) are back there).

The Sloth was written by Trey and Tom and is sung by Trey. It debuted on [1987/08/09](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-09-1987-nectars-burlington-vt-usa.html). The song is sun from the the perspective of The Sloth, who is essentially a hit man. During the piece he highlights his acumen as a human being (sloth?). These things include: sleeping all day, spending nights in bars, singing falsetto and slicing nipples. Very early versions of the song are short and to the point but after completion of his thesis Trey added a bridge that extends the song to about 3 to 5 minutes. It's played the same way every time.

The song remained in Phish rotation until about 1994 when performances kind of died off a bit. Since 2009 the song has been performed 15 times. It was part of the 2011/09/02 show where all the songs started with an S. The Sloth has only emerged from hibernation five times since 2012. The song is usually played in the first set, in fact it only has one second set appearance this century. Today's Sloth is coming from [1993/02/20](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-february-20-1993-roxy-theatre-atlanta-ga-usa.html?highlight=602) and it can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18b_Dru6nJcM4vyc9hTKE-7XOSOZUPGwG/view).

The narration after The Sloth focus on Col. Forbin who is now incarcerated looking at the door to his jail cell and thinking about the door he stepped through to get to Gamehedge in the first place. The familiar open e echoes in the background but instead of saying Wilson, they are now saying Errand. Before Possum starts Icculus is looking down at Gamehedge and smiling. So there you have it, the long Phish lullaby, or childrens story or whatever it really is. Tomorrow we start with songs from the land of Gamehedge that were either not included in Trey's thesis or just written after the fact.

Statistics:
The Sloth was played at 9.39% of live Phish shows.
It was last played August 5, 2017, which was 29 shows ago.
There have been 1,726 shows since the live debut.

PSTOD #74: McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters,"Hello it's me again, the PSOTD guy. If you like this kind of thing and want to guarantee a daily dose of Phish through a [gavage](https://www.google.com/search?q=gavage&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab) then email me at int4rweb@gmail.com and I'll put you on the list.

Today we are going to discuss a Gamehedge song that pre-dates Trey's senior study but for some reason was left off of The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday. Of course I am talking about McGrupp And The Watchful Hosemasters.

McGrupp was written by Trey and Tom and is sung by Trey. It debuted on [1985/04/06](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-april-06-1985-finbars-burlington-vt-usa.html). The lyrics are derived from a poem that Tom had sent to Trey during Trey's fall 1985 semester at Goddard College. Trey attached the poem to his door and would perform it with Phish as a spoken word piece up in 1986. At this time they began to perform the song with the music that originally accompanied [Skippy the Wondermouse](http://phish.net/song/skippy-the-wondermouse/history) (which was promptly retired and never heard again). Since it's inception the song has gone largely undisturbed. Versions from 1986 and 1987 however, have some weird chanting and a lack of a piano section. Trey would use McGrupp as the basis for a significant number of characters in the Gamehedge saga (Tela, Rutherford, The Famous Mockingbird, the Unit Monster, and of course, Col. Forbins dog McGrupp). The song follows more or less the same pattern of music everytime it's played. An intro leads into all the songs lyrics, followed by a full band instrumental suite, then a Page solo before an outro that echoes the introduction. On the four occasions that the band has performed TMWSIY with narration McGrupp has usurped Possum at the end.

McGrupp was played pretty frequently up until the end of 1997 when it slowed down a little bit. Since 2009 it has made 13 appearances with nine of them being in the first set (three second set and two encores). The song is usually good for one or two performances a year still. Today we'll be checking out the lone 2.0 performance from [2003/07/29](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-29-2003-post-gazette-pavilion-at-star-lake-burgettstown-pa-usa.html?highlight=365).

For me it was about six months. My uncle (who is probably reading this right now) would play me songs off rift and eventually gave me a copy because I thought ‚Äúweigh‚Äù was funny. I would listen to it from time to time but always found it ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.  Then somewhere around 13 I brought rift with me on an overnight school field trip as my cd to listen to. 

I distinctly remember fall asleep to it and being awoken by the groove transition in My Friend My Friend and being like wtf was that! I gave MFMF a real listening to and everything spread from there. Next album was Picture of Nectar and my teenage brain exploded. I realized I have to see them live just in time for the first hiatus and had to wait a couple years to see them and if I‚Äôm being really Honest I didn‚Äôt start getting deep into live material until the last few years with a few exceptions like ALO, SSP and Hampton comes alive.

PSTOD #75: (The) Divided Sky,"I figured I can just post the PSOTD at night. This is during non-peak reddit hours though so we'll see how well the posts do. If you want to recieve these via an email at around six am email me at int4rweb@gmail.com and I'll put you on the list. Today we are going to discuss the what is arguably the best Phish composition piece. Gamehedge wise it's a chant done by the Lizards to praise Icculus. Of course, I'm talking about Divided Sky.

Divided Sky first debuted on [1987/05/11](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-may-11-1987-nectars-burlington-vt-usa.html) and was written by Trey with vocals by Mike, Page and Trey. Allegedly Trey has said the song was written during his first year at Mercer Community College on a night enhanced by psychedelic mushrooms. The chant originated while Trey noticed that the sky appeared divided into a light half and a dark half due to the lighting of a nearby chapel. Divided Sky has origins that predate this adventure however. Trey and his mother used to write Christmas songs together and they had written a musical called Gus the Christmas Dog. Two themes from that musical were lifted to form part of Divided Sky.

The song begins with a short introduction followed by the brief chant of ""The Divided Sky, the wind blows high"". After the chant it moved into a section referred to as the ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" or ""Palindrome"" segment which is comprised of an intricate note pattern with a shifting time signature. This is played foreword and then backwards. This segues into a tension and release style of playing. After the main theme is presented, there is a brief pause in the song before Trey plays a theme-resolving note. Today this pause is usually filled with a lot of happy people cheering. In several early 90's interviews Trey has said during that pause he can hear the jam continuing in his head. He also described the pause as an exercise in audience behavioral study because it almost results in three waves of audience cheers. When Divided Sky debuted in 1987 it was a four minute version of itself. The music that now forms the meat of Divided Sky was being appended to [No Dogs Allowed](http://phish.net/song/no-dogs-allowed/history) (another song from the Gus the Christmas Dog musical). In 1988 Divided Sky went on a six month hiatus and when it returned on [1988/09/24](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-september-24-1988-humphries-house-the-zoo-amherst-college-amherst-ma-usa.html) it was the song as we all know it today and No Dogs Allowed was cut down to a four minute radio edit and then all together abandoned in 1990.

Divided Sky was played very frequently from 1990 to 1994. From 1995 until the first hiatus the song was played more sporadically and with less accuracy than the early 90's versions. 2003/04 saw the song being performed with greater frequency, however, it was still suffering from major accuracy issues. Upon their return in 2009 the band seemed like they were wanting to resolve the issues they had had in the past with their epic compositions and proved that by playing Fluffhead into Divided Sky to open their first show back. Divided Sky is almost always played in the first set. You have to go back to 2003 to find a second set performance. It's been used as an encore four times, the most recent being in 2004.

[Today's version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/187vsil9p3u8GPWui1uOkFwwSAUcakOy9/view) is going to come from [1992/11/19](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-november-19-1992-ross-arena-st-michaels-college-colchester-vt-usa.html?highlight=161) where it was played after Mound and before Esther in the first set. If you've got some time to take a Divided Sky deep dive today you can also check out some video of Trey performing the song with a symphony orchestra. Trey has actually performed the song with orchestras and string quartets on many occasions. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5CdsqZxDPU) is a video of him doing with the LA Philharmonic on 2014/09/26.

Statistics:                         
Divided Sky was played at 22.86% of live Phish shows.             
It was last played August 4, 2018, which was 9 shows ago.

Unpleasant experience at Harveys Casino in Lake Tahoe a couple days ago for the Lake Tahoe Summer Concert Series to see Dave Matthews....,"...you know, the Lake Tahoe Summer Concert Series that Phish played at and some of you were at earlier THIS year? I didnt even realize it was the same venue but was checking into the hotel for the Dave Matthews concert this past Friday and noticed the Summer Concert Series poster and saw Phish. ""Oh shit! Sweet. This is where they played!"" And happily walked my ass off to pay the folks at the front desk for my room. Check in. Drop the stuff off and head down to the casino to play some blackjack.

I'm not rich nor a great gambler but I love the action of a casino, one of my many vices. Feeling happy and buzzed for my continuing 40th bday celebration that began at Dicks with the boys and some of you reading this.  I sat down at a blackjack table and while I was waiting to play looked down at my Phish Dick's wristbands I still had on remembering what a great time I had in Denver. Couldn't have been more than 45 minutes (and $300 down mind you) this lady who turns out to be the PIT BOSS comes up to me and starts talking to me. It was a bit distracting considering I was in the middle of playing and I'm not good enough Blackjack player (or mathematician) to play without thinking, but I'm friendly enough and in a good enough mood that I was fine obliging her.

""What are those from?"" she asked, pointing to my Curveball and Dick's wristbands. ""Oh, they're from the band Phish. I was just at their concert in Denver for my 40th birthday celebration."" She stared at me blankly so I continued,  ""I saw they just played here at your venue earlier this summer."" She watched me silent for a second then, ""I dont like those Phish fans, all loud and walking around drunk"". That was the last thing I was expecting to hear out of her mouth, ""Oh"", I said. ""I'm sorry you had that experience, Phish fans in general tend to be pretty nice folk so you must've encountered some bad apples"". ""Yeah I dont like any of them"", she said.....I'm still being dealt cards fyi on a $25 per hand table....""Well I'm sorry you had a bad experience"", I said consoling the PIT BOSS of the fucking table I'M losing money on. ""Yeah just walking around drunk, their long hair stinking like pot over the place""....she said standing on ground where it is LEGAL now mind you....I lost the hand in front of me, BUST....""Now hold on one second,"" I said cupping my hands over my remaining chips. ""I have been going to Phish shows and interacting with the fans for about 25 YEARS now and most of their followers are pretty good folk so I'm not quite sure what your problem is here. But I will tell you one thing I dont like the way you're speaking to me so I'm gonna take my money elsewhere"" and I picked my chips up and stormed off, before I left the casino floor I chucked their stupid fucking players card in the trash.

Seriously though what gives, I know this is just one dumb cranky old bitch but what the fuck Harrahs/Caesar/Harveys entertainment? Phish fans have spent ALOT of money on your properties over the years whether it be in Tahoe, Vegas, or Atlantic City (all of which I've been to and spent money at for Phish shows) and you're going to interrupt an obvious fan who was minding their OWN FUCKING business LOSING money on YOUR table at YOUR Hotel and Casino I was also spending money to stay at to see a show at YOUR venue that I was buying tickets and booze at to come up and tell me that you DON'T LIKE ME? 

WHAT THE FLYING MONKEY FUCK

Sorry to bring a bummer of a story to this board but that fucking pisses me off and I just wanted to throw this experience out there since the only language stupid stuck in the past fucks understand is one that involves money. And I wanted to make Phish fans aware that that is what Caesars Entertainment (owner of Harvey's) thinks of you before you spend your hard earned $ there later this year in Vegas and into the future. Thanks for listening. Needed to get that off my chest while I formulate the most effective social media response.

PSOTD #76: Walls of The Cave,"Shout out to /u/OnlyDeanCanLayEggs who posted about this song before I could copy and paste my email from this morning.

In 2001 Phish was in the middle of an 815 day hiatus that would end on [2002/12/31](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-31-2002-madison-square-garden-new-york-ny-usa.html). With the return of Phish came the debut of new music, one of the songs would address the tragedy (or meme depending how old you are) of 9/11. So get out your dirt and charcoal because we're about to looking at Walls of the Cave.

As I stated earlier Walls of the Cave debuted on 2002/12/31, it's written by Trey and Tom and sung by Trey with everyone else providing backing. Plato's [Allegory of the Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave) suggests that what we see as reality is actually a collection of shadows cast on the walls of the cave that is imprisoning us. Once we acquire higher knowledge, we evolve and are inclined to return to the darkness of the cave to illuminate others of what we have learned. As opposed to forcing our newfound enlightenment on those still trapped inside the cave, we instead choose to leave subtle messages inscribed on the walls of said cave.

The lyrics of Walls of the Cave contain subtle reminders marking the transition from one reality to another, which is essentially what happened 17 years ago today. As time passes year in and year out we are constantly reminded of those we couldn't save. During that same time, however, ground zero has transitioned from a from a hole in the ground to monument of the resiliency of Americans.

Musically Walls of the Cave sounds like what it is: two shorter songs mashed together in a longer hybrid. The Walls of the Cave segment begins with a piano introduction that builds into a slow groove. The Walls of the Cave portion ends with a moment of silence and the beginning of the more up beat rock of Listen To The Silent Trees.

The song usually clocks in at about 12-15 minutes. Some of the 2003/04 versions wandered a little bit. Most notably the 21 minute attempt on [2003/02/22](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-february-22-2003-us-bank-arena-cincinnati-oh-usa.html?highlight=648) (a show that also features a rocking 5 song second set). At this juncture I'd be surprised if it breaks free again. Walls of the Cave would go on to be performed 15 times before the band took a much longer hiatus. The song sat on the shelf for the entirety of the 2009 run but would emerge once again in 2010. From there it's been played pretty frequently with 8 performances in 2016 and 7 in both 2015 and 2013. It's a good thing it came back too because almost all of the 2003/04 versions are not great. The song usually has a home in the first set, though it's been known to make second set and encore appearances. [Today's version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ckAMCNqWpwm701DC_Az1KixBt5cAVmb/view?usp=drive_open) is the lone attempt made in [2012\(06/17\)](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-17-2012-bader-field-atlantic-city-nj-usa.html?highlight=648). It was in the first set after Fluffhead and before a set closing Character Zero.

Statistics:            
Walls of the Cave was played at 2.98% of live Phish shows.

PSOTD #77,"Today's song is about the author, the highly exulted, the knowledgeable, of course we're talking about Icculus. First performed in [1986/04/01](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-april-01-1986-hunts-burlington-vt-usa.html) Icculus is accredited to Trey and Tom and spoken by Trey with the whole band doing backing. Icculus is another song that pre-dates The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday. Unlike most Phish songs the music to Icculus never changes but the words spoken by Trey do. Overall the narration is always a testament to the greatness of the author of the Helping Friendly Book and how much you should really, really, read it. Trey's exuberance in describing the exalted one escalates until it's essentially just shouting. It ends with a quick jam. Really the whole thing is just an exercise to enable Trey to say ""yeah, my children are old enough to read Icculus"" and that's what the whole thing is. Ridiculous. And I love it.

[We'll check out](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16UgCntSvSzZQhLsExZjg0b8eF9EXmCeP/view) the [1994/06/22](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-22-1994-veterans-memorial-auditorium-columbus-oh-usa.html?highlight=296) version that occurred the middle of Mike's Groove after Simple. So it reference's the greatness of skyscrapers and has a few references to Simple itself. There's also some references about the greatness of basketball players but how they would be better if they would read the book. The whole thing is actually very impressive; it went Mike's Song&gt; Simple&gt; Catapult&gt;Icculus&gt; Simple&gt;Mike's Song. Icculus is a rarity and with the exception of mid to late 80's it's always been that way. When it is performed it's usually found in the last set of the night or as an encore. It's made four appearances since 2009 and is currently enjoying a 166 show gap.

Statistics:                        
Icculus was played at 1.49% of live Phish shows.                   
It was last played December 31, 2013, which was 166 shows ago.                  
There have been 1,761 shows since the live debut.              
Icculus has been played approximately once every 67.1 shows.                
Since its debut, Icculus has been played, on average, once every 65.2                  shows.                 
It was played 27 times

PSOTD #78,"Punch You In The Eye debuted on [1989/08/17](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-17-1989-the-front-burlington-vt-usa.html) and is written and sung by Trey. PYITE actually has roots in a one off performance of a song titled [Punch Me In The Eye](http://phish.net/song/punch-me-in-the-eye/history). The only similarity between Punch You and Punch Me is the inclusion of the words kill you til you die and punch you in the eye. To Furthur confuse things when PYITE as we know it debuted it was called Punch Me In The Eye. The song recounts a narrators kayak journey into the land of Prussia. There he is captured by the evil King Wilson and his henchmen. He is bound to a chair and tortured but eventually escapes vowing to kill Wilson until he dies. After the lyrics are sung the song cuts into the Storm Dance instrumental which is an elaborate composition containing Santana-type guitar. This would eventually be extracted and recorded as [The Landlady](http://phish.net/song/the-landlady/history) for A Picture of Nectar.

The rise of PYITE is interesting because it was played six times 1989 before going on a 415 show gap. The song wouldn't rest again until the first hiatus. When Phish returned for 2003/04 the song was played four times but nothing compares to it's state of semi-retiredness from 1989-1993. The next closest gaps are 37 shows ending in 1994 and 29 shows ending in 2017. After the end of second hiatus PYITE would come out strong with 11 performances in 2009. For the last four years the song has been performed twice a year (which means we still have potentially one left this year). Since it is fairly structured most versions clock in at about 9 to 10 minutes. Placement wise PYITE is well balanced between sets but the band does like to use it to start a set. Since 2009 it has opened a set 20 out of the 37 times it's been played. Today we are going to [take a look](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ao2SVoxl4_QY-e69gh-BpH8aEYiAaPBh/view) at the [1996/08/16](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-16-1998-loring-commerce-centre-limestone-me-usa.html?highlight=447) version where it fell in the first set between Rift and Lawn Boy.

PSOTD #79,"I've got two Gamehedge songs left. We've got today and probably Sunday since I need a short break before we switch topics. Because we all like Phish here; I'd assume everyone is into seamless transitions from one thing into the next. The last Gamehedge song will do just that. But first, Axilla (and by extension Axilla Part II).

Axilla (I) was first performed on [1992/11/19](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-november-19-1992-ross-arena-st-michaels-college-colchester-vt-usa.html) it is written by Trey and Tom and sung by Trey with the rest of the band doing backing vocals. It was the last Gamehedge song written. Axilla is another name for an armpit. The lyrics tell the story of a battle with a witch. After it's debuted it was played regularly until 1993. It's brother, Axilla (II) debuted on [1994/04/16](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-april-16-1994-mullins-center-university-of-massachusetts-amherst-ma-usa.html) and is another Trey and Tom joint once again sung by Trey with the whole band doing backing. It filled the role of Axilla (I) in 1994 until it's retirement in 1995. Musically the songs are essentially the same, but part II has a slow guitar lick ending that is occasionally tacked on to Axilla (I). The song(s) are straight forward heavy rockers with little variation between versions.

Axilla (I) was initially used to open sets. Axilla (II) could be found anywhere before it's absorption into it's younger sibling. Currently you have better odds of seeing Axilla in the first set than the second, but that doesn't mean they don't play the song in the second set. Today we'll [get a glimpse](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Fy5vtr1ewCyHRltl5TASTF-TkDcVzpP/view) of the most recent attempt at Axilla (I) from [2018/07/24](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-24-2018-bill-graham-civic-auditorium-san-francisco-ca-usa.html?highlight=37).

2.0 Show By Show,"Following a hiatus that began in 2000, Phish returned to perform on December 31st, 2002, and continued to play until the last night of the Coventry Festival on August 15, 2004, marking an era in the bands lineage referred to as ""2.0"". This era has had its quality of play highly debated, and in a fit of stimulant fueled sleeplessness, I decided to write a brief review on every single show, more or less commenting on the highlights of each night. Enjoy!

12/31/02 First show post-hiatus. The type of show that if you weren't physically there, then its nothing special. Waves, Seven Below, and Walls of the Cave debut, all being played fairly well.

1/02/03 Chalkdust &gt; Gin opener similar to 8/09/04, but not as long/improvisational. Back on the Train is a good listen, energetic and moderately fluid. Simple -&gt; My Friend, My Friend is not super well played, but I love the combination of those two songs. 46 Days debut is awesome, clocking in around 20 minutes, setting its place in the Phish rotation immediately.

1/03/03 Pebbles and Marbles debut. Nice peak and clean play. All of These Dreams also debuted, not much to talk about there. Aside from a well played Wolfman's, this show is largely banter. Instrument switching during rhe second set closer, Possum, so you know it's not going to be gorgeous, but still some good on stage antics.

1/04/03 Anything But Me and Friday debuts. Aside from that, great song selection, 
 but nothing spectacular- just a well played Roggae and Weekapaug, as well as a nice Maze.

2/14/03 Fee -&gt; Taste, Bathtub Gin, WOTC -&gt; Carini. Good playing and decent transitions. Fun listen. Late second set AC/DC Bag -&gt; Caspian is a nice way to send you off.

2/15/03 Good moments in both sets, particularly the Ghost and the Hood. Ghost is an atypical (for the era) euphoric groove with nice work from Page, and Hood is mostly type I predictable jamming, until the band breaks into an extended, ""angry"" outro jam.

2/16/03 Piper -&gt; DWD Reprise (funkalicious... very captivating/moderately sad video on YouTube). Very very good listen with high dancing capabilities and a full band Disease jam. One of my favorites from 2.0... possibly my favorite Piper, if I'm being honest. David Bowie -&gt; Catapult -&gt; David Bowie and Disease -&gt; Seven Below -&gt; Disease are also worth listening to.

2/18/03 2.0 MOMAs are always a treat. Some decent, above average playing at times, and a debut of a capella The Lion Sleeps Tonight (see 04/30/94 for good instrumental versions, most notably the David Bowie found on Faux The Archives Volume 3).

2/20/03 Waves &gt; Simple, Jibboo, Tweezer (baby brother to the 2/28/03 tweezer), second set is exceptional, nothing that captivating.

2/21/03 Fairly average, but satisfying. Dark Mike's jam, segue into a decent Free. Lifeboy break out (last played 11/25/98).

2/22/03 Not amazing but definitely one of the better shows in 2003. Piper is really nice with some blissful keyboard work. Mildly intense and quick build up leading into the segue into Weekapaug (the first of this song without Mike's Song) which is especially fluid. Both are very type I versions with nothing that stands out other than good musicianship. Nicely played Tube that goes into near ""noteworthy"" territory in terms of length (11:30 min) by today's standards, with clean full band interplay. Gin follows and is played well as well, with a couple neat teases. Clocks in at 26 minutes and change, making it one of the longer ones ever performed (perhaps only surpassed by the Winston-Salem '97). Beautiful rendition with a very euphoric, ""hose"" jam, until they change their tone and start going into a darker, more daunting jam that plays on the ""Gin"" theme, which almost sounds like a digital delay loop jam. Set II &gt; Set I in my opinion (isnt that generally the case, though?).

2/24/03 Nothing particularly great. B.B. King played with the band for Everyday I Have The Blues through Rock Me Baby. Not fantastic, but not deplorable.

2/25/03 Just solid playing. Worth a listen if you find yourself craving 2.0 but something aside from the standouts. First set is fairly well played with some good energy, and the second set is nice song selection, but nothing special. Talk was played for the first time since 8/06/98.

2/26/03 Beautiful and energetic YEM, serene Roggae, √ºber funky MOMA, above average Stash (despite it being rather straightforward), nice and a Ghost filled with improvisation, including a segue into Low Rider. Honestly one of the better shows of this era. A great listen start to finish with plenty of stand out moments. Lots of fun debuts in the first set of some short songs previously performed by various side projects of the band.

2/28/03 One of the (if not THE) best 2.0 shows. Destiny Unbound bustout. Phenomenal ""hose"" type Gin that's exceedingly euphoric, followed by a calm Sleep to bring us back down to Earth, right before the super high energy and quite possibly best (or at least my favorite) Back on the Train. Tweezer is one of the best ever in my opinion. Extremely cathartic with some really great work from Fishman. Nears the 30 minute mark and not a single second is wasted. The young folk might refer to this jam as ""epic"". A weird Bowie (pretty hard to listen to, but unique, I suppose...?) follows after the first Soul Shakedown Party since Amsterdam '97, which is proceeded by Round Room before a nice, tension filled, climactic Hood to close the set. Destiny Unbound was played for the first time since 11/15/91. This show is in contention for one of the best shows ever played in my opinion.

3/01/03 A fairly great show to end Winter Tour '03. Fun song selection as per my taste, A nicely done Foam marks the ""best"" part of the first set. The second set does not disappoint, with a high octane Piper that hints at Oye Como Va at times, and is just generally excited in nature, coming to a conclusion at around 17 minutes. YEM -&gt; Proud Mary is absolutely worth listening to. Very nice playing all around followed by some fun, full band a cappella, on a song that hadn't been played since the very first time Phish performed together. 

7/07/03 Not much to mention, aside from the spacious yet groovy Wolfman's Brother that segues into the debut of Scents and Subtle Sounds, which has a fairly intense jam section. More or less the only part of the show worth a visit.

7/08/03 Two type II jams in this one. Down With Disease to open Set II, then after two stops at Vultures and the debut of Secret Smile, we get the first type II Harry Hood of Summer Tour 2003. 

7/09/03 YEM -&gt; Simple to start the show. I think this might be the only time they've ever -&gt;'d between the two.  Chalkdust is pretty cool, with an interesting ending that is based off of the rave-up in The Mango Song. A type II Gin ends the first set, with multiple sections and some abstract space/dissonance, transporting the listener into another planet. Piper &gt; Twist -&gt; Scents is the bulk of Set II, including the first ""big"" Piper of Summer Tour 2003 (honestly, I think 2.0 was the prime era for Piper. Between the 2/16/03 version and the 7/31/03 version, I truly believe there was something in the Worm's water.) A very groove oriented jam that climaxes before falling into a calm ending. Twist is pretty standard, but still a solid version with a good segue into Scents. Good show to listen to start to finish, but not that phenomenal.

7/10/03 Pretty good MOMA in the first set that's repetitive at times, but nonetheless funky with some good energy behind it. Interesting Divided Sky with a jam akin to Dave's Energy Guide. Rest of the show isn't great honestly.

7/12/03 A very driven Taste starts of the show, which carries some momentum; however, not much else follows. Interesting song choice, which some might have a distaste for. Maze is always a nice ending to the first set, and this time around the band gets real nasty with it. Lots of angry and dark vibes coming from this Set I Closer. Set II isn't anything special, either, for the most part, until a nice and heavy hitting Ghost comes out to play, with some beautiful, varied jamming with Izabella-esque moments. After they hit the peak of the show in that late second set performance, a Bowie follows to close Set II and prepare us for an energetic Frankenstein &gt; Tweeprise encore. Average show with some real nuggets of greatness. 

7/13/03 Seven Below. Featured on the 7/29/03  LivePhish release as filler. Strange, but cohesive with a cool, darker toned metal jam that comes out later on in this improvisation fueled rendition. Rest of the show isn't anything special, but this Seven Below is.

7/15/03 AC/DC Bag &gt; Ya Mar, Mike's Groove, Mr. Completely (with an abundance of segues and transitions for this debut, including BBFCFM, Low Rider, and Ha Ha Ha), Walls of the Cave (aggressive type I WOTC work). Great beginning to the show in Bag &gt; Ya Mar, setting up the night to be filled with energy. Ya Mar especially has fantastic interplay between Trey and Page. Mike's is very standard, but nonetheless played well, with the grit that you should expect from 2.0, and leads nicely into Hydrogen and ultimately a rocking, groovy Weekapaug to end Set I. The debut of Mr. Completely consumes the majority of Set II, with some incredible funk jamming, proving early on that this new song means business. They begin to jam on Low Rider for a bit, and then jovial madness ensues when they segue into Big Black Furry Creature From Mars, followed by an uptempo Buried Alive, Continuing with the mayhem, they play BBFCFM again, with a brief stop at Ha Ha Ha, and then BBFCFM once more before returning to what you could consider Mr. Completely to end a nearly half set long series of segues and jams. Walls of the Cave is played shortly after, and it stays pretty type I with some San-Ho-Zay teases and high tempo shredding. Definitely one of the better shows from this era, and a show that's worth a listen from start to finish.

7/17/03 A decent first set with a good performance of Back On The Train (followed by a &gt; into Divided Sky) as a highlight. A fun Set I closing sequence that includes dancing and transcendence in a span of  25 minutes. A fairly good second set starts with a spacey Tweezer that segues into a moderately jammed out Makisupa Policeman, followed by a well played Limb by Limb. Some more or less standard renditions of some songs common to the era and some songs that are staples in the Phish rotation follow, before ending Set II with a nice Antelope that has a major mode jam in the midst of the traditional buildup to the ""Rye, Rye, Rocco"" segment.

7/18/03 The first set is really only marked by very exceptional version of Roggae that is a bit more rocking than usual; however, the Bathtub Gin -&gt; Mango Song is definitely interesting. A improv filled Disease that segues into Catapult starts us off in the second set, with mediocrity to follow until a very spacey, effects laden Twist takes over for a bit, which is quite enjoyable, and then leads into a less than spectacular Character Zero to end the set. A 16 minute type II Hood is provided for the encore, which is very similar to other versions of the song played this tour, albeit significantly shorter, and caps off the show very nicely.

7/19/03 While there's nothing special about the first set, the second set could stand alone. An extended, exploratory Piper starts us off, spreading itself out and filling any and all empty holes in the sound surrounding the listener. Some great, spacey yet driven and energy filled jamming with no particular destination, until they decide to move forward and play Rock And Roll almost immediately after ending the jam. A well played, type I Rock and Roll proceeds and adds some more liveliness to the set before segueing beautifully (near flawlessly) into an equally type I Seven Below, which stays withing the boundaries of a conventional -7, until it segues yet again into a Prince Caspian that is a bit more gritty, perhaps even angry, than usual, as is customary with 2.0. A nice, predictable peak ensues, and then the band arrives upon YEM. A well played composed section is followed with an extended jam section that's reeeaaalll funky and very characteristic of the time period, being very rough around the edges yet somehow clean and funky,  which leads to a vocal jam, sans bass and drum segment.

7/21/03 The first set includes a fairly straight forward, yet well played, Stash and a nicely jammed out Birds that has an ominous glow behind it which leads into a calm transition into a pretty typical Mike's Groove, aside from Weekapaug, which after some typical, high energy type I jamming moves into more percussive and exploratory space, and concludes with an atypical rave-up outro. Set II doesn't have too much depth, but does include a nice, rocking Taste with a strong peak, followed by an exceptionally improvisational 46 Days. Your standard, run of the mill, Summer Tour 2003 performance,

7/22/03 Some atypical song selection/placement is accented by two great performances of two great songs. An 18 minute Gumbo in the first set flirts with dark and light themes and provides equal parts contemplation and excitement. Very characteristic of 2.0 Phish, and an amazing version of this classic.  A 23 minute Split Open and Melt is the prominent part of the second set. Although about half of this rendition is pretty typical, maybe even lackluster, the boys eventually navigate their way into a multi-sectioned, dark, uptempo, rocking jam that might fit in in the soundtrack of a horror film. 

7/23/03 Although this show has multiple great moments, the most important part to me is the late Set I Sneakin' Sally. I firmly believe that this is the best version of this cover (which really only means it's my favorite), Replete with gnarly funk, this jam rages on for over 15 minutes, which, at the time, was the longest version performed (San Francisco 2016 having recently dethroned it). No vocal jam is included, just straight up, fiery, sludgy, dance inducing greatness. I should probably mention the Scents, Disease, and Antelope that go beyond standard format from this show, but just give them a listen if you're interested. They're pretty damn good too.

7/25/03 A nice, proper Chalkdust early on in the first set sets the tone for an exciting show. One of several lengthy 2.0 Bathtub Gins fills the role of jam vehicle for the first set, with multiple sections that provoke emotions of both euphoria and anxiety. After a fairly standard remainder to the first set, and an equally non-spectacular beginning to the second, Harry Hood has begun in the second to last slot of this portion of the show. A sloppy composed section leads into a monstrous type II jam that is pretty atypical for Hood, with an extremely exploratory section with great depth in the place where the band usually builds to a peak after around 12 to 15 minutes, and brings the whole song near the 30 minute mark before reaching the proper Hood peak. Type II beauty filled with dark tension,  and overall great interplay between the band. As an added surprise, Set II closes with a very nice Bowie that includes a full band Tweezer tease in the midst of the jam. Another 2.0 show with a lot of musical merit, worthy of praise.

7/26/03 An It's Ice that could easily be found in an early 90's setlist is featured early on in the first set. Lots of improvisation, as one would expect, and a very well played version overall. Average playing follows up to Taste to close Set I with some really beautiful peaking and an extended solo from Trey who brings the volume down real low before bringing it all the way up for a fiery close. One of the acclaimed Summer '03 Pipers leads off Set II, and is practically the only part of the set that is worth talking about. Over 20 minutes long, multiple sections, and heavily improvisational, as you should expect from these Pipers. Just incredible, fluid, full band play, that includes a Can't You Hear Me Knockin' tease. The show as a whole has good song selection in my opinion, with a nice balance between jamming and your standard rock and funk that Phish bases many of their songs upon.

7/27/03 A near 20 minute Ghost and an over 10 minute Caspian are the highlights of this show. Nothing that far out there, with Ghost being your standard Summer 2003 exploratory version, culminating in a rocking peak, and Caspian barely make its way beyond Caspian proper, but definitely being with inspiration. Good song selection, regardless.

7/29/03 (Spotify release) The first set has a very nice Jibboo, which is played very well and peaks very nicely albeit predictably, but lasting a bit longer than most versions. Definitely a good energy to it. Scent of a Mule is always a treat, being played 5 times in two years post hiatus. A well played composed section, with a digital delay loop jam prior to the klezmer, which briefly leads into an angry, heavy metal type jam before concluding in standard fashion. Includes a ""Wouldn't It Be Lovely"" jam from Trey, Fish, and Mike during the ""Mule Duel"". Fee leads up to a Maze tease in the outro, with synth work from Page, before  segueing into a rage filled Timber that nearly goes beyond conventional format before concluding. Two songs later, the band plays the only performance of McGrupp and The Watchful Hosemasters during this era, and a great one it is, with Page leading and full band participation during the jam before coming to an end. Set II opens with Crosseyed and Painless, which develops into a behemoth of a jam. Over 20 minutes of percussive, rocking, energetic heat capable of melting steel beams. A great version that's the trademark of one of the most notable shows of 2003.

7/30/03 A phenomenal first set Scents and Subtle Sounds sets the tone early on that this show is going to be great, with 30 minutes of rock, funk, space, grunge, sludge, and grit, driven by an amazing performance by Fishman. Perhaps the best performance of Scents to date. Chalkdust is brief but worth noting, as it's played pretty well and has an even darker theme to it than your typical ominous Chalkdust. Second set is nothing to sleep on either. Twist is very 2000-esque, being somewhat ambient with a 2003 edge to it, and a good amount of exploration that almost peaks before shifting towards a dark sentiment. Bug, which is always welcome for me, follows and this one is played well, but frankly there's nothing special about it. One of my favorite YEMs (if not my favorite) proceeds it. Transitions between ""composed sections"" are so clean that you hardly notice them, and the playing inside each part is very crisp. The jam segment is very high octane, being equal parts funky and rocking. WOTC is your standard, well played 2.0 version. Worth a listen nonetheless, ending a great four song second set of a great show

7/31/03 Pretty good show overall. Nice MOMA with some cool sound provided by Mike's ""Meatball effect"", followed by an average yet enjoyable Divided Sky, providing a nice transcendent energy to contrast with MOMA's funk. The final ""big"" Summer 2003 Piper kicks off Set II. Beautiful, yet a bit more eerie than the two preceding it, and a bit unsettling at times, with the expected full throttle race to the finish. Mike's Song comes next, with nothing really worth noting, and after wrapping up and transitioning into Hydrogen, we arrive upon Weekapaug, and it's predictably as funky and bouncy as the other versions performed this year, with an In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida tease following an extended funky outro. Another type II Hood closes out the set, and while still dark and exploratory, this performance is a bit more melodic than its 7/25/03 counterpart, and ends about 7 minutes earlier. Good song selection in this show, excluding a late second set Friday prior to Hood.

11/28/03 First Crimes of the Mind since 1994. Well played Waves with an extended intro and a jam on the scarier, jarring side. Disease moves a bit past type I, but nothing that far out there. Not all that spectacular.

11/29/03 Pretty below average. Lots of San-Ho-Zay teases. Banter in the middle of the second set. Twist is the only real noteworthy moment, with a major mode jam that makes its way into the realm of dissonance before reconvening on a more groove oriented theme, and then getting dissonant again with some added anger before segueing into Simple. Good song selection; however, the majority of them are played with a degree of mediocrity.

12/01/03 Cool show. Somewhat of a nostalgia act, with Jeff Holdsworth coming on stage for Camel Walk through Fire, and that being the first time he played with the band since he left in 1986. Wolfman's is played nicely with a euphoric ""type I on steroids"" jam. Tweezer opens the second set, with Trey particularly absent from the jam. Enjoyable and fun but not too hard on the mind.

12/02/03 20th anniversary of the first ever Phish performance. Some fairly inspired playing with a nice, driven Piper in the middle of Set I. Rock and Roll opens Set II with a nice bluesy/groovy jam that segues into Weekapaug, which was played without Mike's Song preceding it; however, Trey sang the lyrics to Mike's Song over the Tweezer Reprise that followed. Late second set Boogie On Reggae Woman is played with some gusto, and is followed up with a very brief Cities. Maze follows with an unusual style following Page's section and continues into Trey's part. Lots of segues in the second set, which is always pleasurable, but not quite as high quality as others. Good song selection in my opinion.

12/28/03 Pretty solid playing throughout. Tweezer has a nice Trey solo in the middle of a fairly standard jam that gradually brings the song to a peak. A very well played Frankie Says comes along a few songs after, with some beauty as well as darkness, followed up with Llama with a bit of an usual Trey section, accompanied by some good playing by Page. A strong, happy Jibboo opens the second set with a very strong peak with some great synchronization among the band members. The Suzy that follows is almost violent in nature, and includes a second jam, similar to the Darien 2000 Suzy, with this one being more angry and heavy metal based. A nice Theme from the Bottom follows, which is played a bit calmer than usual. A standard Hood ends off Set II with a nice, pristine peak. Definitely a show that has more value start to finish as opposed to its highlights.

12/29/03 First set has its moments. Piper opener is strong but conventional, with a return to the refrain at the ending. Limb by Limb has multiple peaks and some great energy. Second set starts off with five segues: Rock and Roll -&gt; Twist -&gt; Boogie On Reggae Woman -&gt; Ghost -&gt; Free, but none of them are particularly fortuitous. Worth a listen, though. Followed by a strong Divided Sky with some powerful moments of silence prior to a beautiful conclusion.

12/30/03 Super funky 2001 with Parliament-Funkadelic, Bathub Gin, Sand, and Auld Lang Syne teases, initiating a dance party to end Set I. Tube -&gt; LA Woman &gt; Birds &gt; LA Woman is fun, fairly well played, but in my opinion, Tube would've been better off standing alone. Extended jamming with a very nice funk groove characteristic of Tube. P-Funk Medley is so bad that it's funny and I love it for that reason. George Clinton sings Lil Jon... all I can say... A calmer, melodic Disease ends the set.

12/31/03 Wilson was finished from the night prior to open the first set. Mike's Groove climaxes with a rocking Weekapaug jam that grows dissonant at times, with Jungle Boogie teases, followed by an energetic return to Weekapaug with Divided Sky teases. Tube is finished from the night before, Stash turned into a jam with multiple sections, including a lot of effects, some more rhythmic sections, and some good old upbeat major mode jamming. Runaway Jim is jammed out, with a lot of intensity and improvisation, making for a great, unique version. Overall, New Years 2003 was a decent run with some great moments sprinkled throughout, but no real consistency.

3/13/04 The boys play the National Anthem at a UVM Basketball game. Go Bengils! That's college level!

Vegas '04... sad, although I did enjoy listening to Trey sing the lyrics to Meatstick over Tweezer Reprise. 

6/17/04 Live In Brooklyn (available on spotify) is a pretty good show across the board. ASIHTOS has a nice jam that's fairly dark at times, and definitely rocking. Later on in the first set there's a great version of MOMA Dance, with some awesome abrasive funk rock to start, leading into the verses, followed by a dark, Death March-esque outro jam that segues into Free. 46 Days -&gt; Possum is an excellent way to start of the second set, with a great pulsing jam out of 46 Days leading into an excellent segue. The Suzy that follows is very jammed out and improvisational, seemingly played with a lot of drive and purpose. The remainder of the second set isn't half bad at all, but nothing out of the ordinary.

6/18/04 Jay Z SPECIAL GUEST. 99 PROBLEMS, BIG PIMPIN'. Monumental time in Phishtory.

6/19/04 Great show, up there with some of the greats. Song selection is key here. First set doesn't have any serious stands, but rather operates as a beautiful unit. Mid second set Piper -&gt; 
Tweezer Reprise jam -&gt; Piper -&gt; Gotta Jibboo is the highlight, incredible, lengthy jam with a great segue from song to song. Absolutely a must hear, perhaps the trademark 2004 jam. Some argue that this is one of the best Pipers of all time.

6/20/04 I believe that this show is In contention for one of the best shows ever. Waves is the centerpiece of the first set, with a nice rhythmic jam included some Maze teases. Aside from that, the first set has some great songs and some well played short jams, capped up with one of the best performances Drowned, with an amazing, celebratory uptempo shred fest, with Trey landing on a really enjoyable theme towards the end. Second set functions best as a whole as opposed to having stand out moments. Dark, yet celebratory and energizing. A great set to end a great run at SPAC.

6/23/04 Nothing spectacular but I really enjoy the song selection in this show! A calm and groovy Gin as well as a tension filled Scents with some NO2 teases are highlights of an otherwise decent show. Good combination of fun, catharsis, space, and improvisation.

6/24/04 Really cool first set, unusual placement with the Loving Cup opener. A nice Cities -&gt; Back on the Train follows, which is combination I'd love to see more of. DWD -&gt; Rock and Roll is not spectacular, but still enjoyable. Personally, I'm not huge on this second set, but Tube and Timber are great. I really enjoy the way those two songs are played in 2003-2004.

6/25/04 First set highlight is a Wolfman's that's nastier than Watkins Glens' water supply. Awesome funky groove that stays within the bounds of Wolfman's proper with a signature 2.0 abrasiveness. Good Seven Below to open Set II, albeit pretty tame. Love Buffalo Bill and Lawn Boy in this slot. Another good 2.0 Weekapaug also with inspired celebratory shredding, making for a very fun to listen to second set. Interesting YEM &gt; 2001 -&gt; YEM.

6/26/04 Sick Moog work from Mike in this Boogie. Very dancey and bouncy. Free and Ghost are played exceptionally well, with Ghost being a bit more upbeat than usual for 2004. Friday separates this sequence from a snappy and rocking Piper that provides the set with a bit more energy before closing with a relatively standard version of Hood.

8/9/04 Mostly a pretty poor show with Trey suffering technical problems; however the Chalkdust and the Gin to open the first set are great and could easily find themselves at home as a second set opening combination. Chalkdust is around 20 minutes long with some melodic jamming that goes beyond your conventional Chalkdust. Lots of emphasis on Page in this one, and the jam is very driven, emotive, and powerful. One of the better Chalkdust jams out there. Bathtub Gin comes in right after to keep the momentum going with some intense, 2.0 typical jamming that peaks really beautifully. Sadly, the momentum fades and the rest of the show is rather mediocre.

8/10/04 The first set starts and ends with some phenomenal jamming in AC/DC Bag and Birds. Both jams are extended and inspired, culminating in very celebratory peaks. Yet another good 2.0 Weekapaug is played during the second set, with an unusual, slowed down ending. Rest of the show is between average and less than average.

8/11/04 A Page driven Suzy in the second song slot adds some fuel to the first set, with a superb jam segueing into a dark, exploratory Disease. Fishman is particularly strong throughout this jam. Antelope opens the second set, and instead of peaking like normal, makes its way into a more melodic, groove-oriented jam, with the ending verse being excluded. Later on in the second set, the band packs some serious energy into a 10 minute Waves. A beautiful intro leading into the verses followed by a very inspired jam. Straight to the point and delivers its message effectively with euphoric excellence.

8/12/04 YEM -&gt; Ghost &gt; Maze -&gt; Catapult -&gt; Maze is enjoyable. Good transitions/segues, but lacking any spectacular jamming. Second set starts off very mellow and low key, with a nice and calm Piper opener followed by a Sneakin' Sally that's equally as tranquil. After taking several steps along the way, Scents closes out the second set with a typical improvisational jam, combining themes of rhythm, groove, dissonance, and ambience. 

Festival notes

IT: DWD, Ghost, Chalkdust, 46 Days, Waves, Ya Mar, Reba, really the whole weekend is worth listening to. A great performance overall. Fantastic improvisation that extends for longer periods of time, similar to jams of the early 90s. 40 minute 46 Days, very dark Waves and Ghost, extended Ya Mar jam -&gt; Runaway Jim, and possibly the best Reba for the era. Chalkdust jams for over 20 minutes. Night one is very segue heavy, especially the third set,  with every jam seemingly hitting full potential, with a nice balance between high energy rocking and deep, dark, exploration. Night two has a similar balance, however the extremely ominous jams in Ghost and 46 Days are hard to match up against. The Tower Jam on night one is worth mentioning, however your time is better spent listening to the in-set performances. Seriously, these shows are worth listening to start to finish on all accounts. A definitive conclusion to an excellent summer tour. The soundcheck is widely regarded as one of the best ever (although I think Bethel Waves or Clifford Ball takes the cake).

Coventry (8/14/04 - 8/15/04)  WOTC &gt; Runaway Jim -&gt; Gotta Jibboo, AC/DC Bag -&gt; 46 Days, SOAMelt, Drowned, Ghost, Wading In The Velvet Sea (if you're in the mood to cry), both nights are worth listening to in their entirety if you can tolerate sloppy composed sections that are tainted with sadness... seriously some great, cathartic, tension and emotion filled jamming. AC/DC Bag is divine, jamming for over 20 minutes with a great rocking energy leading up to a clean segue into a brief 46 Days. Split Open and Melt is one of the longest versions of this song, coming in at just over 31 minutes. Trey delivers an emotional speech before beginning, and this clearly affects his performance, as the composed section is atrocious, however the jam is phenomenal, with tons of improvisation and grooving with understandably melancholy undertones, before becoming a bit more optimistic for a few minutes, setting up a segue into Ghost and bringing the set to an angry, dissonant close. Overall, the soundcheck might be the easiest part of this festival to listen to, but there are moments of really great, inspired jamming.

Llama debuted on [1990/10/27](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-october-27-1990-rhythm-room-dallas-tx-usa.html) and is written by Trey sung by Trey with Mike and Page doing backing. Llama tells the story of of the last moments of a brave Game hedge rebel's life. He embarks on a suicide mission with a pair of bazookas mounted on the back of his Llama and detonates a cache of explosions killing the Wilson-loving loyalists and himself. He dies knowing he did all he could and his last vision is of his own Taboot (a wooden brick or stone monument placed over coffins in some religions).

From it's debut in 1990 until 1994 Llama could usually be found in the first set. In 1994 Llama found a home as a show opening song. After that it would again return to being a largely first set piece and occasional show opener from 1995 until first hiatus. Upon return from hiatus Llama again began to appear as a show opener, filling the role in 4 our of it's 7 2.0 appearances. When they came back in 2009 they were happy to leave well enough alone. There have been 13 performances of Llama since 2009 and 8 of them have been show opening songs. The longest Llama-less gap of time since 1990 has been 51 shows ending in 2017 and 39 shows that ended in 2009.

Trey wrote Llama during a stay at Page's parents house. At the time Phish was on tour with Aquarium Rescue Unit. ARU was as fantastic band with Col. Bruce Hampton, Oteil Burbridge (Dead and Co, Allman Brothers Band), Jeff Sipe (Leftover Salmon) and my man Jimmy Herring. The pace of the song is said to be inspired by ARU's performances. Today we'll [run game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K_SPA_2YpBHlFVyJa_g1_HS-ctl9l7GW/view) on the [1993/02/19](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-february-19-1993-roxy-theatre-atlanta-ga-usa.html?highlight=345) version featuring Jimmy Herring doing what he does best. But wait, there's more! While Llama is a fast paced song that doesn't mean that the band doesn't cool it down. From time to time (twice to my knowledge, though I'm sure I'll be corrected by someone) Llama gets played slowly. This first occurred on [2015/08/14](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-14-2015-walnut-creek-amphitheater-raleigh-nc-usa.html?highlight=345). We'll just grab [ourselves an earful](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kjBQs2d7SfX-eoNadmotSOtuq3NVD5-0/view) of that taboot.

Statistics:            
Llama was played at 16.81% of live Phish shows.         
It was last played August 12, 2018, which was 3 shows ago.              
There have been 1,363 shows since the live debut.           
Llama has been played approximately once every 5.9 shows.           
Since its debut, Llama has been played, on average, once every 4.5 shows.
It was played 305 times.

Weird song assosciations,"What weird associations do you have with Phish songs?

In 10th grade (mid/late 90s), you showed up as our substitute teacher and would be there for like 3 weeks. You were a white girl with colorful dreads which was, to say the least, an unusual thing for the Utah public school system. Additionally, you were only like 5-10 years older than us. My ""high school crew"" and I were way into Phish at this point and you commented on my Phish shirt one day. We found out you caught every show you could and were forever chasing  Horn live (which, IIRC, was a really rare song in the 90s). So now whenever I hear Horn (like at Dick's night 3 this year), I always think of you, and I hope you caught that Horn.",phish,1537261102,ummmmmnnmmm,4,23,True,2018-09-18
PSOTD #81,"We'll kick of our animal journey with a series of songs about man's best friend. Dogs Stole Things was written by Trey and Tom and has Trey singing lead with Page doing backing vocals. It debuted on [1997/06/13](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-13-1997-the-sfx-centre-dublin-ireland.html) alongside Limb By Limb, Wading in the Velvet Sea, Water in the Sky, Vultures, Ghost and Olivia's Pool. The show also features the Phish debut of the Sly and the Family Stone song, Stand and the Jimi Hendrix song, Izabella. It would not end up appearing on Ghost however. Realistically, I have no idea what this song is about and anyone's guess is as good as mine. The lyrics appear to outlines the habits of pets that steal the dreams of their human owners.

The song was in heavy rotation in 1997 with twenty performances and remained in decent rotation until the first hiatus. It had two performances in 2003 and wouldn't be seen for 167 shows until it opened [2011/08/10](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-10-2011-lake-tahoe-outdoor-arena-at-harveys-stateline-nv-usa.html). From there it would go on to be performed three more times and hasn't been seen since 2017. It's been played in the first set  The two longest gaps are 182 (ended in 2016) and 167 (ended in 2011) shows. The song is always found in the first set with the exception of two performances. It makes for an easy breather. Performances of the song don't vary much from attempt to attempt. We'll get a [big glass](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tcit1D7MDgBA9mND6Hi1l1LwBZBRC1xr/view) of the rare second set Dogs Stole Things from [2003/02/22](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-12-2003-gorge-amphitheatre-george-wa-usa.html?highlight=165) today.

PSTOD #82,"Now that the dogs have stolen your things where have they gone? Dog Log (originally appearing as Dog Gone Gone) was written by Trey and has Trey singing with Mike and Page doing backing. It debuted on [1985/10/30](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-october-30-1985-hunts-burlington-vt-usa.html). The song tells the story of someone looking for their dog. While they walking across the lawn they spot a steaming dog log and thin to themselves where has my dog gone? Musically it has walking beat and kind of a jazz funk feel.

The most well known appearance of the song is from [1995/12/11](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-11-1995-cumberland-county-civic-center-portland-me-usa.html) where Trey told the audience they were recording an album composed entirely of fifteen different versions of Dog Log. Trey then proceeded to coach the audience to get quiet and boo really loudly. Trey has also stated on several occasions that the song was a favorite of Paul Languedoc (former Phish sound engineer and builder of guitars). This wasn't entirely the case as Paul cleared up in an interview saying that one time Trey asked him what song he wanted to hear at sound check and he picked Dog Log. Out of this a running joke began with Phish constantly playing the song at sound checks. So while the song rarely gets performed it does get sound checked pretty often and they can be hilarious.

Dog Log has remained a relative rarity with 24 performances to date.  The song is all over the place set placement wise. It only has one performance since the band reunited in 2009. That performance came on [2012/06/20](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-june-20-2012-ntelos-pavilion-portsmouth-va-usa.html?highlight=164). It was taken by request with Trey stating ""Alright then, that's enough of [those damn signs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T_pPYFpgxPgYFj5xpm2_lGggS5kRwDy5)"". Currently it's on 236 show gap, it's second longest to date. The longest is 283 shows and the thirst longest is 218.

Statistics          
Dog Log was played at 1.32% of live Phish shows.           
It was last played June 20, 2012, which was 236 shows ago.

Alpharetta N1 Ghost (8/3/18),"Has been my jam. Summer Tour MVP jam. I love everything about it, beginning to the end. Almost no flubs, long jam that stays interesting all throughout, almost goes full hose at times, esp around 18 min mark. The jam stays both dark and uplifting. Mike‚Äôs bass sounds incredible. Trey and Page fucking shred it. Fish is a machine. My only complaint is the abrupt ripcord in the end. 

What is your favorite jam this past tour?

A Poem,"Last week's fears proved valid

Ignored, used, the end of the ballad

&amp;#x200B;

He remained true

My TV screen, his face not new

&amp;#x200B;

Shredding the strings

Twisting his face

I watch in the future

Our spirits embraced

&amp;#x200B;

Wondering if this will remain sufficient

I contemplate my feelings diminished

&amp;#x200B;

Will I need something more?

Am I setting the trail?

For something bleak in store?

I can not say

But I smile watching him

"So, I translated some Phish song into Korean","Basically, I saw a post about someone taking the lyrics to ""Ice, Ice, Baby"" and translating them into Korean and then back into English, and naturally my mind pushed me to do this to Phish lyrics.

Tube:

Asteroids crashed and baked anything
It made me wonder:
Does the tiger sleep with a lily patch?
Does the rhino play in the thunder?

I have a pain in my left ear.
I felt the truth but I could still hear.
I made you think I would not ride.
Rather give yourself to science.
I felt I could help.
In science, I felt I could help.

The doctors paranoidly ran away.
Shout his graphic translation.
Two weeks of confusion
Gang War and Fortune
Spewing their color
He deliberately waited until I was finished.
Tap the toilet door
I spoiled the fun and blamed me.
He knocked it a bit more.
Funny, he knocked at it a little more.

Alloyed suitors painted inside
Apple or grape
Mercury clouds out
He ran in the car.
On the highway in Los Angeles
Once spraying is over
Because of the necessary pain
You are a portrait of your past.
There is a mummy in the cabinet.
Are there any more arrows left?

What is the rubber bottle doing here?
How about a roof napkin?
Now 10 cents to dollars
Pregnant hen on the shelf
Robert Palmer
gams, gams, gams

Too big to live in this tube.
Such a great life in this tube
So this is a huge life in the tube.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps if you are also on phish.net you have seen me talking this up.  Anyway, I am doing a weekly Phish show on Mixlr, Wednesdays from 9-11 pm EST. As the subject says, this is going to be 1.0 Phish only. Baby grand era onward (1993-2000), 'open source' recordings. We will dig into deeper tracks, second tier stuff, with some legendary jams mixed in as well. To start, the format will be music only. I may add commentary in the future, but you want to hear Phish, not my stupid voice.

Before the show started I chatted with this very nice fella behind me. We ended up exchanging numbers, which is when I noticed the 850 area code and realized he was from Florida. Not the longest trip to get here, but still a nice drive. He had been seeing them since 93 and was at show number 61. 

Then of course the show started, and they absolutely turned it up to 11. What an incredible night. Can't wait to do it again tonight!

Anyone know what happened to the person that passed out in the page side of the lawn last night?,"I was walking on the main pathway between the pav section and the lawn and I saw a large team of EMT/venue security walking in a speedy manor with flashlights  looking like they were on a mission, being in my very spun state of mind, I figured I would follow behind them to see what happened, which I later realized was a bad idea because they were on their way to tend to someone that I think was a young woman who had a look in her eyes as if she literally had the life sucked out of her. It was a pretty scary thing to see... I‚Äôm just curious if anyone here knows this person or was around that section and knew more than I do about their situation. Once I initially saw the woman and what she was going through I went into a sort of state of shock and it was hard to just leave. I stayed there for a minute hoping praying and wishing her all the best. I‚Äôm just concerned. I‚Äôve been there before.

What songs haven‚Äôt been played this decade?,"From ZZYZX on Facebook today - thought everyone would enjoy!

After a few years playing the break the record number of songs played game followed by the no repeat for 13 shows Bakers' Dozen, I had a momentary curiosity as to what is left. What hasn't been played this decade?

That is the problem with bustouts. Like so many things they're a non-renewable resource. Every time one comes out after a long gap, people get excited, but then that one is burned [1]. I decided to see what hadn't been played this decade 8 years in. After coming up with the right thing to put into the Phish Stats Pattern Matcher [2], I went to the most common songs not seen, cranked it up to 50 and looked.

The most common song Phish have not played in this decade? ""Take the A-Train"". That fits a pattern. These songs can be largely (slightly under half) lumped into a few groups: Fishman songs , jazz numbers that might not scale to larger venues  songs that got swallowed by another or changed (e.g. standalone ""Fluff's Travels"" segments...), and a Capella songs. 

Of the ones that are left, a lot still aren't high up on most people's list. Is there clamor for ""Acoustic Army"" or ""Dave's Energy Guide?"" If you're looking for a real bustout, I think these are your best possibilities:

""All Things Reconsidered."" Pros are that it's really high up in the number of times played, hadn't been played in 21 years, and it's featured on one of the more popular studio albums. The con - of course - is that it's not a very forgiving song to perform on a whim. 

""Johnny B. Goode."". When Phish were in the mood, they blazed through this in the 90s and it's the kind of song that can be played reasonably well if someone randomly calls for it mid set. It is a cover though and a pretty common one, so that might damper the excitement a bit.

""Eliza."" Beautiful, short, and hasn't been played since 1992, this would be my first call for a bustout if they wanted one. I don't know how hard this is to play, but I would love to see it again.

""Talk."" It only barely hasn't been played outside this decade (last appeared on the 11/1/09 acoustic set), but it feels more like a common Phish song than its 14 actual performances. 

However, if I could choose one song out of the Top 50 Most Common Not Played in the Teens to return... it would be a cover, it would be a Fishman tune, but it would be my personal favorite. Not played since 6/10/94, played 9 times in Phish's history, I'd love to see the return of ""I Wan'na Be Like You.""

The remaining pickings are weird, but that's one I've wanted back since the time I saw it. 

[1] Mind you, if a song is only played once a year, while you don't get that whole thrill that the song hadn't been played since 1993, there still will be thousands of people seeing it for the first time by luck of the draw.

Checking one off the bucket list tomorrow.,"So I sort of live a charmed life. Snagged tix to The Gorge shows pretty close to go time, booked flights and easy camping, then flew out with my best bud and we had a total blast. VIP access, 24 hr concierge service that was amazing. Then there's the venue and surrounding area itself. Totally amazing. The downside being that I had to give up on the Camden and MPP shows to do it. 
.

So tonigh I'm rolling out of my night class and I get a text from one of the guys I see shows with telling me I have tickets to both shows for face value if I want them. FACK!!

I absolutely can't take off from work on either Wednesday or Thursday because I just took off a week for the Gorge and I'm taking ANOTHER wee next week for my wife's family reunion. Man, if I go...work is gonna be a struggle the next day. Plus I have a test in my class on Wednesday which is kind of a big deal. Decisions decisions... 

.

So I say fuck it and decide that seeing a show on BOTH coasts in the same summer that I turn 40 is just too awesome to pass up and I tell him I can take one for Tuesday only.   That is a REALLY important part of the plan for me making a LOT more money soon. Plus, I gotta start packing for a trip to South America for my wife's family reunion this weekend. Wednesday just ain't happening. 

.

So I meet up with dude, drop $45 on him and take my tired ass home. Get here and go to put the ticket in my wallet so I won't forget it tomorrow and realize it's a phuckin PTBM ticket. No idea how this stuff keeps happening to me, but I think I'm gonna ride this wave right up onto the beach.

25th Anniversary of My First Show,"I was only 15 years old on August 7, 1993, when I saw my first Phish show.  I couldn't (legally) drive yet, which made going to shows difficult.  Compound that with the fact that I lived in a small town and I really hadn't had much experience with live music at all.  (My first concert of any kind was the Grateful Dead at Rich Stadium on June 13, 1993.)  
  
Phish had played near my town on February 10, 1993, and I knew people who were going to that show.  At that point, though, I didn't really know anything about concerts...I'm not sure I even knew where to go about getting tickets.  I wasn't invited to go along with the older people going to that show anyway, and finding a way there myself would have been very difficult.  So, my first time seeing Phish would have to be delayed until August.  
  
I don't remember if I'd heard any live Phish tapes before that show.  I certainly wasn't familiar with all the songs they played.  The Picture of Nectar CD was definitely familiar to me, because that was my first exposure of any kind to Phish.  
  
Unfortunately, because I was so new to the band, a lot of great stuff from the show was lost on me.  I didn't know what the hell was going on during Kung, for example.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the show immensely and was definitely hooked.  
  
Listening to the show now, I hear a (somewhat) different band than the one I saw at the Gorge this summer.  The Phish of August 1993 is gone forever, which is somewhat sad.  On the whole, though, it's not only inevitable but necessary.  I don't think any of us would truly want to band to just stay the same as it was in any particular period of their music (though I would definitely like to hear another 1994 level performance now and again).  My relationship with the music has had its ups and downs.  I was checked out for pretty much all of 2.0, and before the Gorge shows this summer the last time I'd seen Phish live was in 2012.  They have to keep changing, though, because they always have.  Pick any two years in the band's history and you're likely to hear big differences.  There is a noticeable difference between 1993 and 1994, 1994 and 1997, 1992 and 2000, etc.  With that continuous evolution comes the possibility of the band entering territory that I, or you, do not like as much.  I just have to accept that, because it's certainly happened before (let's be honest, they've written some downright bad songs in recent years) and will happen again, as long as they keep playing.  The only thing that will keep them playing, though, is being able to evolve and change.  I don't think any of the band members want to be up on stage trying to recreate the sound of 1993 (or any particular year) forever.  And let's be honest, we don't either.  ""1993 Phish is dead, long live 1993 Phish!""  
  
I've gone a bit off track here, but suffice it to say that if you haven't heard 8/7/93 before, you owe it to yourself to give it a listen...

Dude that collapsed in the pit 8/5 Sunday Alpharetta,"Did anyone else see this?

We were Page-side in the pit midway through the first set.   About 5-6 people to the right of us, in the center, this dude started puking then collapsed onto the ground.

Security was there very quickly who radio'd to EMS.  It took EMS about 90 seconds to get there, and 3 of them helped to pick dude up and help carry him out.

There were lots of people around trying to give him water, and at first I thought it was just heat stroke and alcohol, but as soon as everyone cleared from around him and I could see the look in his wires, he was clearly spun.  Had no clue where he even was or what was going on.  He couldn't even figure out how to drink out of the bottle.   He never lost conciousness but was totally out of it.

Knowing we wanted to see them again as soon as possible, we made plans to drive up to New York for what will probably be the best set of shows this year. Only problem is that we missed ticket sales - by a lot. Now we're desperately looking for tickets, and dont want to stoop as low as paying double for them. 

Cash or trade is swamped with requests, and ebay is getting ridiculous. Does anybody know of a better way to find curveball passes? Time is running out quickly, and any help would be greatly appreciated!

Want to go to Curveball but were reluctant to go solo? Hit me up.,"Here‚Äôs the deal.  I have one extra wristband and I‚Äôll be a Wednesday arrival.  I‚Äôm renting a campervan in Newark and driving up on Wednesday.  I‚Äôll be going through Scranton, PA and passing into NY State around Binghampton.  If you are on or close to this route and you wanted to go to Curveball but were reluctant to go solo, this could be your chance.  I am coming solo but hooked up with another Redditor that is also flying solo and was looking for a ride from the NYC area.  So we‚Äôre looking for a third solo act to fill out our campsite.

Ticket is face value plus fees ($270).  You get a ride, a wristband and a camping spot (obviously you‚Äôll be bringing your own tent).  I plan on doing some shopping in the Binghampton area (cooler, beer, snacks, maybe another shade tent, etc.) so if you need to grab some things as well, there is a planned stop.  My campervan has a duel burner propane stove although I‚Äôve learned many moons ago that the vendor food at festivals is inexpensive and tasty so I rarely cook anything at festivals.  Point being is you are free to use it if you want to go the cooking route.

Again, I am not putting this wristband up for sale for just anyone that needs one, it‚Äôs specifically for the person that was reluctant to go alone.  Also, this isn‚Äôt a first come, first serve situation either.  PM me and we can open a dialogue.  Since the fellow Redditor I‚Äôm picking up and I are from very different demographics (a/s) I‚Äôm looking for someone to round out the group.

"You Enjoy Myelf - I told my little brother to follow the etiquette for enjoying one's self at a Phish show, and I was dead wrong ...","... according to Trey.  


My bro has only been to like 7 shows in 3.0.  I've been to 49 and started in 2.0  We went out to the Gorge together which was the first time he has seen them outside of our home town (ATL).  


So Saturday night he gets a good and drunk before show, not fall down drunk but more of a healthy buzz.  Myself and the other two we were with (his friends) were dosed so we were in a different state of mind than him.  So we get down to the pit area and the show starts and he is having a good drunken time dancing around.  Then he started to woo.  He would do it like 3 or 4 times a song, loud and long, and not during the peaks.  Knowing how the phanbase feels about that, myself included, I started telling him to stop.  I'm mean I'll let out one or two woos a show during an intense peak and during Vultures, but what he was doing was wrong.  But he insisted that this is Phish concert and everyone should enjoy how they wish.  He said the people around him don't mind and were giving him high fives.  


By the 4th song his friends had moved elsewhere in the pit away from me and my bro.  They agreed with me but were making me play the big bro role and were enjoying their spun state of mind.  I was getting pissed and it was ruining my vibes and head state.  At set break I darted away to get closer and away from him.  But he followed.  That is when I told him I don't want to watch the show with him and to leave me alone.  I enjoyed the second set on my own.  


Back at the campsite a brotherly verbal fight ensued.  I told him that is not how you do it a Phish shows, especially on the west coast.  That he was definately pissing people off around him.  People came to hear the band, not him screaming at the top of his lungs.  But he was been a stubborn, think-headed little bro.  He said he can enjoy himself how he wish and that the people around him liked him.  


Things finally cooled down the next day and by night 3 we were all together in the lawn.  My bro cut out the woos (he said because he had partially lost his voice and his throat hurt) and we raged to the best show of the run.  


Then I listened to the Ask Trey.  


Maybe that is why Phish raged in Alpharetta.  They love the drunk rednecks wooing it up.  


TL&amp;DR: My chomper little bro was a wooer, I told him to stop and we got in a fight about it, but Trey said I was wrong

Here are my questions: Can I show up to MPP, get a parking pass and hang out on lot? Would I be able to find some tickets on lot at a sold out show? Normally, I have my tickets taken care of beforehand. This is my first time having to do this and making sure I can get my crew in to have an amazing experience. Thoughts?

If you are in the front of the house tonight..,"Please, please look out for people throwing glow sticks at the band. If you see somebody throwing glow sticks at the stage, alert security who is all over the pav. I was in the pit last night and saw maybe 10 glow sticks get launched with force at the band. Most of the glow sticks were aimed at Fish and Mike. Every time I saw a glow stick go over the railing I could tell it was coming from the from the pit/very front of the house because of the velocity and upwards direction the stick was traveling. One was thrown with some serious force and it just missed Fish‚Äôs Head. I put my hands up in anger. It really bothered me, but nobody else in the pit was phased. 


Their rigs are super duper large and complex which is why they don‚Äôt move around the stage much when the play. All it takes is one poorly thrown glow stick to fuck it all up for everybody. Can‚Äôt imagine what would happen if a stick got lodged in one of the spinning Leslie speakers.


Treys Rig - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nG-jXPQe1ak


Mikes rig - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8NDxginP3fk


Page‚Äôs rig - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1EyKV1wRvT8 (biggest/best setup)



I believe Trey and Mike recently upgraded their rig to a more simplistic setup, but it still goes to show all the moving parts and pieces situated on the stage. 


I know the people who throw glow sticks at the band are very unlikely to be on this sub, reading this comment, which is why I‚Äôm imploring you to go to security if you see somebody else doing it.



Last night was my first time being in the pit at major amphitheater and it really bummed me out the way people so close to the stage disrespected the band. As a life long resident of the greater Philly area, I could say this behavior  stereotypical Philly BS, but I imagine this problem persists elsewhere, so I‚Äòll leave it and not mention the trashy, ‚Äòruin it for everybody‚Äô, classic Philadelphia behavior. Not gonna mention that at all.



Just wanted to make this PSA because I was so disappointed with people pegging shit at my
favorite band. Hopefully people chill out tonight. Enjoy night 2 of Camden!

She spent 30 hours in jail charged with 1 misdemeanor and 2 felonies, she has a lawyer and is going to try to fight it.

How does the band pack for tour?,"Just a random thought my Driver started pondering the other day...

How exactly do they prep for tour?  (Like, non-musically).  Do they have assistants who pack for them?  Do they pack themselves?  I'm sure they pack at least a few things for themselves; they are still just people, obviously.

But, seriously... I don't know why, but I'm suddenly so curious about this -- do their buses have wardrobes that are always packed and ready?  I'm sure this is the more plausible answer, but even if that's the case, do they own the buses?  Or are they rented?  If they're rented, they can't leave stuff on them...

And especially when they start a tour on the west coast -- they all live in the northeast, so they have to fly out to the first venue -- who preps all their shit?  The crew takes care of all the gear and stage equipment, but who takes care of Fishman's dresses?  Page's shirts?!  Trey's 3-button pullovers?

"VENUE PROFILE: MPP ‚Äì what‚Äôs new regarding the recent renovations, with photos.","I was there a couple weeks ago to feel the Byrne, and thought I‚Äôd post an update on what‚Äôs new at Merriweather since a number of people have asked about it. Any other pointers/corrections/clarifications are welcome in the comments, of course.

**1) Parking:** the lots are now paved, striped, and numbered. They have ‚Äúno tailgating / no alcohol‚Äù signs but we‚Äôll see how serious they are. Byrne crowd wasn‚Äôt exactly partying, so it was hard to gauge. If you don‚Äôt have a pass (which is free, a welcome relief if you were at Camden), try a distant space at the Mall or Hickory Ridge Rd. I‚Äôve parked up in the neighborhoods there before with no problem.

**2) Security:** used to be pretty cool, now they have a ‚Äúno backpacks‚Äù rule, size limits on other bags (15‚Äù x 15‚Äù I think), bag searches, and metal detecting wands. All relatively casual as far as that kind of thing goes, more like Nashville than the Gorge.

**3) Merch:** the merch booth is now only over on Mike side, I think, so if you want a poster line up at the West Box Office Entrance, the booth is right inside that entrance. Poster tubes were $5 each at Byrne, not sure if that‚Äôs the norm now or if it varies with the band.

**4) The roof:** the roof has been raised way up from where it used to be, with these added and as-yet unfinished elevated decks on the sides, likely not open 'til next season, possibly ADA-related as they‚Äôre served by elevator shafts. There are also separate stairs down to the pit in addition to the old walkways through the pav seating. The view has really opened up, should be great from the lawn, and it‚Äôs a little brighter inside the pav. There are also two screens flanking the stage now, and just one central screen on the roof facing the lawn.

**5) The lawn:** the lawn now has a paved walkway running across the middle from Mike side to Page side.

**6) Drinkin‚Äô:** cut-off is about 10:30, seems to be the norm now.

**7) Smokin‚Äô:** they‚Äôre trying the ‚Äòno smoking‚Äô thing again, but it‚Äôs likely nothing to worry about, same as most pavs these days. I did see some vapers but didn‚Äôt bring mine so I can‚Äôt say how that shakes out with security.

**8) What hasn‚Äôt changed:** if you haven‚Äôt been there since 2015 the new bathrooms and concessions closest to the pav may be new to you, I forget when all that was added, but otherwise the surroundings are the same. Shade trees are still there, picnic tables are fewer but still there, and the surrounding development isn‚Äôt really noticeable from inside, it‚Äôs still trees and sky, which is nice.

**9) Photo album:** [https://imgur.com/a/9oXQvNx](https://imgur.com/a/9oXQvNx)

"Thanks, Phans!","Wed, 8/8/18 was my 4th Phish show and 2nd time bringing my daughter, now 7. I was VERY nervous about the crowd. Her first show was when she was 1 in Atlantic City 2012. That day we found a nice spot by a light pole and had lots of other families crowd around us. The first set went very well but during the set break and as the 2nd set was starting, it. got. weird. the crowd just swarmed in, pushing around. we weren't even close to the stage. we left and missed the 2nd set.  the crowd felt off, not sure if it was protective daddy or what but we didn't feel safe.

Fast forward to last night, we found a nice spot on the lawn, near another family. People started filling in as it got closer to show time but there wasn't any crowding. first set goes off nicely. second set starts and.... everybody still respected each others spaces!!! the group behind us had a drunken friend that they kept holding back, he accidentally hit me and his friends promptly apologized. he got close to my daughters chair and they moved him to the side.  the crowd felt safe and fun and groovin'.

so thanks for being a great crowd last night and i look forward to bringing the family to another show or two next year!

tldr: daughters first show in 2012 had off drug/drunk fueled crowd, left cuz didn't feel safe. last night was a great respectful crowd. had a great time.",phish,1533859691,xiceburnx,9,11,True,2018-08-09

20 years ago today Phish magic happened for me and Brother.,"20 years ago today my brother and I went to see Phish in VA Beach. I don't have any pictures or keepsakes, just my memory of one the most beautiful concerts I have ever been to. They played ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" which was a song that was very special to me and my brother after my  Uncle Mark played on his cello at his wife's and my Aunt Linda's funeral just a few years before. Just imagine the feelings that my brother and I shared at that moment. Then, the encore happened, Phish covered Terrapin Station as the band commemorated the third anniversary of Jerry Garcia‚Äôs passing. The first and last time it was ever played by Phish. An emotional moment shared for me and my brother with üåà &gt;YEM, followed by an emotional moment shared by everyone in attendance üê¢. Listen to the crowd erupt when they figure out they are playing Terrapin Station, you can almost hear the audience crying. 

I also want to mention that my brother and I were together for our first Phish show in 7 years at Bakers 8/4/17. And the next day was our grandfathers, so emotions were running high, and the first song they play is ‚ÄúI hope they keep my grave clean‚Äù. Are you kidding me?

I tell people all the time that magical and unexplainable things happen at Phish shows. Whether it‚Äôs something that you experience, or with someone you love, or an entire crowd, magic happens at Phish shows. 

I want to hear about the magical moments that have happened to any of you. Set your soul free.

[GIVEAWAY] Summer Tour 2018 is *just* about here...so I wanted to celebrate by giving away some stickers and a shirt,"Hi, everyone! You may remember me as the guy that made all the Phish/NHL logos in 2016.

If you don't recognize me from that or have a clue what I'm on about, [check these out](https://imgur.com/a/Z3TCE).

Summer Tour '18 is *just* around the corner and I'm dying of excitement. **THREE NIGHTS AT THE GORGE?** *(foams at the mouth and falls over backwards...or falls over backwards to foam at the mouth)* And Curveball??!?!

I want to celebrate the upcoming tour with giving away a sticker to five people and a t-shirt to one person of any of my designs. Details below:

WHO CAN ENTER? Anyone. I'm going to regret this when someone in Tanzania wins the t-shirt, but whatever.

WHAT AM I ENTERING? A random drawing. I'm just going to put names into a hat, literally or metaphorically, and choose winners that way: the five sticker winners first and then the t-shirt winner last.

WHEN DO I ENTER BY? I'm going to do the drawing after noon EST on 7/13/18, but I will be taking new entries up until the moment I do the drawing.

WHERE DO I ENTER? In this thread.

WHY DO I ENTER? Cause you like Phish and/or free stuff.

HOW DO I ENTER? You post your favorite(or one of your top five favorite) Phish jam in this thread, including the date and song name. Leave out the date or the song name and your entry doesn't count. But really, it's as simple as saying something like ""7/15/16 Crosseyed"".

IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET A LEG UP ON OTHER PEOPLE IN THE DRAWING? Man, you're a horrible person for asking that...but, yes, there is. **Do one altruistic action between now and the time I do the drawing.** As in, help someone across the street, donate a dollar to charity, etc. Doesn't have to be big. Just do something(something above and beyond just holding the door for someone, at least). After you've done it, add ""did something"" to the end of your original entry post(either by edit or insert it when you originally write it, I'm not chasing down replies). I'll make sure to get you a second entry into the drawing.

SO SAY I WIN, THEN WHAT? Well, I'll PM you on here and ask for your mailing address and what logo you want and then I send out your prize(ETA probably end of July). You'll have seven days to get back to me. If you don't, I redraw your prize for someone else.",phish,1530837486,PhishLShirts,195,50,True,2018-07-05
What's your most unbelievable Phish-related story?,"Last summer at Dick's I raged with Trey's kids purely by accident.

My dad took me as an 18th birthday present/HS graduation present. It was n2 and was trying to find any one of my Twitter friends to spend the show with, but they were all in the stands/nowhere to be found. My dad was also in the stands - he's a lifelong straight-laced Deadhead who just wanted a place other than the ground to sit. So here's me, freshly 18 (seriously, by a few days), all alone at my 3rd-ever Phish show. I was leaning on the fence around the soundboard area hoping someone official would notice the horribly sad look on my face and offer me a spot to sit and a backstage pass or some shit. (Wishful n00b thinking, huh?) *Shit*, I think to myself, *I'm going to have a horrible night and spend the show by myself and be all lonely.*

But just as I was about to throw in the towel and accept my pitiful fate, I turn around, and I see none other than Eliza Anastasio. I just knew it was her. I pulled out my phone and checked Instagram to compare faces and realized I'd hit the jackpot. I didn't think I'd see her or Bella (2nd of Trey's kids) in the crowd, mingling with all the dirty wooks who'd probably all give their left nut to meet Trey for even like 5 seconds. I knew I had to talk to them. I played up some sob story about how I needed Advil, my head hurt so bad, my dad's phone died and I couldn't find him, it was my birthday and my friends ditched me, my mother never hugged me as a child, etc etc. They were SO nice and welcoming and gave me some water and took me into their group. (I should mention that it wasn't just the two of them; they had some friends too, one of whom actually runs a lil Etsy business who I've purchased things from before!) So I got to know this group of wooks very close in age to me. After a few minutes of playing it cool I told them ""Look, I know who you guys are. It's so cool to see you mixed in with everybody else!""

They were super chill about it, and let me ask as many questions as I wanted. I of course had to shush my urge to ask ""IS PAGE REALLY AS SWEET AS HE SEEMS IRL????"" 8 million times, but overall, I kept it really mellow. I actually had super great convos with most of the group. 

Once the show started, they lit up a joint (!!!) and passed it in my direction. I HAD NEVER SMOKED WEED BEFORE! I'd sworn myself away from drugs. I was on a lifelong purity streak and I didn't want to mess anything up. I said ""Um, I'm not too sure about this. I'll pass. Thanks though!""

But then I realized, holy shit, Trey's daughter just PASSED ME A JOINT. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE COOL YOUNG PADAWAN PHISH THING. I MUST DO IT. 

So I said, ""Wait! You know what? I'm going to give it a try."" They were like, ""Hell yeah girl! Your limbs might get heavy and your mouth will get dry. If your heart starts beating too fast, let us know and we'll drag you to the hospital."" I took a hit and gave them some candy in return and have never felt more badass in my life. (Luckily, I did not get high, despite taking an unbelievable amount of hits that night. It would've probably been scary for me if I got fucked up.)

Rest of the night went on like any old normal show, really. I hugged Eliza at the start of Reba. Bella held my fanny pack while I went to the bathroom. Some guy 12 feet away from me kept hitting me in the ass with his long ass wook dreads. I cried during Lizards. I hugged some ladies around me at the end of the show but never exchanged a word with them. It was the greatest thing.

So yeah, that's my story! Let me know if you've had any awesome experiences like that. I would love to hear them! :)",phish,1530848139,k4ngfirmmmd,2,0,True,2018-07-05

Opie is a rottie/boxer rescue and about 4 years old. He is very sweet and friendly even though he might bark initially. He jumped the fence and was last seen in the Norfolk Highlands neighborhood.

A true hater this girl was. It wasnt like she dug in any claws or really was shitty towards me about it, it was always just kind of an amusing debate whenever we'd be hanging out.

I'd ask her ""well, have you ever been to a show?"" 

""No, and I never will.""

""Well its never going to happen.""

""Just go to a show and then we will talk.""

Every conversation about Phish was always some iteration of that. She'd hate on Trey and Phish, I'd retort with ""see a show"". 

Her boyfriend, my roommate at the time, who is not a huge phan, but casually likes TAB, took her to a Trey show that happened before BD. She came home and said she ""didnt have a terrible time"", but still was clear that she wouldn't like Phish because TAB and Phish are different sounds (which is definitely true). I again said ""go see a show and then we will talk"".

Well, she is a hair stylist, and she had this big industry thing going on in NYC one week that she had to travel to...just so happened to be the first week of BD as well. I told her it was fate and she needed to go. She laughed about it and said ""well, I've never seen MSG before so I guess that would be cool to see."" 

I said ""it can't hurt to walk by the venue on one of the weeknights and see if any cheap tickets are around. If they were cheap, would you go?"" 

""I guess if they were really cheap.""

She goes off on her trip, and Jam Filled night comes up. I am watching the stream and losing my goddamned mind to Lawn Boy, when I get a photo message on my phone from her with a picture of the stage, and then a follow up text:

""you were so right.""

---------------------------


LADIES AND GENTLMEN! We‚Äôve hit 5 years of the annual /r/phish summer tour contest. Apparently in marriages the gift you should give your significant other is wood (or silverware to be more modern).

**What is this contest?** I‚Äôm glad you asked. Simply put, YOU, the user of reddit and subscriber of /r/phish will guess what songs Phish will play each night of their summer tour from Stateline, NV to Commerce City, CO.

**How do I enter?** In the Google questionnaire linked above submit your guesses on what you think Phish will be playing. Select the date, enter your songs, and submit!

**What are these categories?** The standard categories to guess are set 1 opener, set 1 closer, set 1 wildcard, set 2 opener, set 2 closer, set 2 wildcard, and encore. There is also two bonus categories, bustout and cover song. There will be a separate form for Curveball N2.

**What does wildcard mean?** A wildcard guess is any song that they play in the set.

**Are there determined point values we can earn from each category?** Yes! Openers, closers, and encores will be worth 5 points. Wildcards are worth 3. Cover songs are also worth 3 points and guesses that are submitted as ‚Äòno covers‚Äô (which means Phish will play all of their own originals) will net 1 point if guessed correctly (if Phish plays all originals). Bustouts, which are must harder to guess, are worth an outstanding 10 points this year! If you don‚Äôt believe Phish will bust anything out for the night, enter ‚Äòno bustouts,‚Äô and they do just that then you will earn 1 point.

**Last year I didn‚Äôt like the partial points system. How will it be updated this year?** I did take in the feedback and made sure to put in what you all suggested into practice. If you select a song (let‚Äôs say Sample In A Jar) as the set 1 opener, but it‚Äôs played as either the set 1 wildcard or set 1 closer then you earn 2 points. If it‚Äôs played in a different set (anytime during set 2, the encore, or set 3 during Curveball) then you earn 1 point.

**What do you consider a bustout?** A bustout is a song that hasn't been played in 50 shows, minimum. 

**What constitutes as a cover?** A cover is a song that is considered a TAB/Mike/Vida Blue/Pork Tornado song (god forbid they play Pork Tornado) or obviously by another artist (Bowie, Talking Heads, etc). I consider everything on an album an original (Manteca, Bug) plus SOME songs that haven't really found a home on an album (Halley's Comet, How Many People Are You). Please ask for certain clarifications on what you think is considered a cover. If enough people disagree then I‚Äôll put up a poll to decide.

**I want to make my bustout call also be a guess in the standard categories. Can I do that?** Your bustout call can be the same as the opener, closer, encore, or wildcard. An example is that you say your bustout call is All Things Reconsidered. You can also say that All Things Reconsidered can be a set 2 wildcard. However, if you pick a song like Sing Monica as your set 2 wildcard, then pick All Things Reconsidered as your bust out call, and only Sing Monica gets played then you get just the appropriate point amount for that guess from that category. To look at songs with a 50+ show gap you can look here: http://www.phish.net/songs 

**I‚Äôm feeling lucky and want to put my bustout and cover as the same guess.** If you wish to put the same guess for a cover and bustout, you can. Covers and bustouts are rare. If you're crazy enough to call those categories together you may go ahead.

**Phish is totally going to pay respects for [insert artist here] that passed away last week. Can a debut be called as a bustout?** Debuts can count as a bustout.

**Can‚Äôt I just comment my guesses in here instead of using Google? Google scares me‚Ä¶** Sorry, you must post in the Google Form for your calls to count. If your call is posted in this thread rather than Google Form I'm not responsible for tracking it.

**The second day of Curveball will have 3 sets and possibly a secret set. What are you going to do about that?** Curveball N2 guesses must be entered in on a SEPARATE form. It is linked above. There is also a mini-bonus point possibility in there too!

**What is the point of this whole contest?** Well, there are real life and virtual prizes! 1st place gets $25 from the Dry Goods store with a month of Reddit Gold, 2nd place gets to choose any show to download from livephish.com with a month of Reddit Gold, and 3rd place gets one sticker/patch from the Dry Goods store and a month of Reddit Gold. 

**That‚Äôs awesome! Can I help donate money to increase the prize pool?** There is a link at the top of the page for donating to the contest! All money collected will be turned around to the contest. I will not be keeping any of it. 

**When do my guesses need to be in by?** Your picks must be in by the scheduled show time. Here is a [time zone converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) to make sure you don't miss the start of each show. 

**When are winners announced?** Winners will be announced the a few days after the Dicks' run. It takes some time to double check scores and verify everything.

**I‚Äôm impatient. Can I enter all of my guesses right now?** You can enter in all of your guesses today or guess each show the day of the show before it starts each tour date. Either will work. Just remember to enter it in before the band takes stage or else I'm going to throw out the responses. I will use [@Phish_FTR](https://twitter.com/Phish_FTR) tweets to get accurate times to cut off.

**I have more questions‚Ä¶** No problem! If you have any questions please shoot me a reply in this thread or in a PM.

**How come your answers aren‚Äôt nearly as funny as the ones from the Curveball FAQ page?** Idunno, leave me alone.

Gorge camping questions,"This run won't be my first run at the Gorge, but it'll be my first time camping there and I'm going solo. Just had some questions the venue website FAQ isn't totally clear on and some other stuff. I tried prowling through here and .net forums and wasn't quite finding anything either.

- Shower fee for standard camping. Is it quarters? Single bills?

- Is a small butane stove okay on campground? Gotta grill me some cheese.

- Any insight on a tent vs. sleeping in my car? Leaning towards the latter, and just putting up some curtains and cracking the windows so I don't roast alive in the morning.

I copied the following from my post in r/R/travel but hopefully you can assist. We are driving to the Raleigh and Columbia shows but making a road trip out of it the week leading up to it!

My girlfriend and I are taking a road trip from Chicago and Asheville is one of our first stops. We will be stopping in Louisville the first night just as a resting point and the following morning heading to camp somewhere near Asheville off of I-40. We've looked at numerous campgrounds and there are a ton of options near the Great Smoky Mountain National Park but it's fucking huge with tons of different sites. Does anyone know of any campgrounds in particular that won't take us too far off of I-40 and that is more so car camping? We aren't exactly looking to backpack too much our sites and would like some great hiking near the camp site. We are staying there for 2 nights.

TL;DR: Looking for some names of campgrounds near Asheville, NC that isn't too aggressive and with some nice spots to go hiking near the site. Thanks!",phish,1531317287,franandharpua,6,3,True,2018-07-11

Set the gearshift for the high gear of your soul! Summer 98...,"I am deep in the thick of summer 1998, especially July, and loving every second of what I'm listening to right now, psyched for what's right around the corner, summer 2018.

For my own tastes, summer 98 was an especially great moment for Run Like an Antelope -- they're all explosively good. Most recently I was struck by the fact that while Riverport Gin gets all the love, that particular show was bookended by Bathtub Gin at the start and Antelope closing it out (before encore). And damn, what a hot Antelope.

Anyway, I am loving Riverport, Shoreline, Ventura, Phoenix, etc - heaing an amazing blend of funky and psychedelic - and if there's something I shouldn't miss from summer 98, please let me know.

Should I go to Curveball?,"Ok so a little about me: 

I'm a new, very casual fan. I've been to three shows (all during the dozen) and loved all of them, but I don't really feel the urge to listen to Phish all that much outside of a live show setting.

I have exactly zero friends who are phans, so this would definitely be a solo mission. Obviously, since I've seen Phish before, this isn't exactly new and I usually don't mind it at all, but a three day festival is more than I've ever even considered doing on my own.

I genuinely just love live music and probably go to 50-75 shows a year. That being said, I'm kinda all over the place and not super into the jam scene, although there are definitely some other jam bands out there that I am into (my only real issue with the scene is that even mentioning some of them could get this conversation very off track and probably get some of us a little too heated).

Logistically, its only a 4-5 hour drive and the money shouldn't be an issue (not like I couldn't think of something else like another show or festival to spend it on). Time off of work isn't an issue and I have no other plans that weekend.

So what does everyone think? Am I crazy to even think twice? I'm open to hearing any comments/tips ya'll have to offer. Thanks!",phish,1531788994,ASAP1492,24,6,True,2018-07-16

Twas the Night Before Phishmas,"Twas‚Äô the Night Before Phishmas All have through our nook Not a creature was stirring Not even a wook The hoodies were hung by the chimney with care ... In hopes that Phish would soon be there And I in my lot shirt and my heady mama with her booze Had just settled down for a quick summer snooze

When out in the lot there arose a great cheer I sprang from the bed to grab a freshie beer Away to the shakedown I flew like a flash, Cracked open a brew and smelled some faint hash The moon shone down on the freshly laid out wares As the cops walked around but clearly didn‚Äôt care When what to my bloodshot eyes did I hear? But a mini vw bus with 6 n00bs driving it down the street in low gear

With a ginger for a driver, so torn and so frayed, I knew at that moment it must be Trey! Faster than Llama his phanners they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name: ‚ÄúOn Fee! On Rutherford! On Mule and Tela the spy! On Horse! On Guyute! On all of you guys! To the top of Tahoe! To the heart of Nevada! Now dance away! dance away! dance away faster!‚Äù

As unsold extras that before the dance party did fly, When they meet with the ticketless, hoping for The Divided Sky, So up to the rooftop the phanners they flew, With the VW bus full of jams, and Fish Mike and Page too! And then just like that I heard on the roof The dancing and jumping of each members foot. As I put on my dance shoes and was twisting around, Down the chimney Trey came with a Mound!

Trey was dressed to the nines, and Mike in purple pants Page munched on a sandwich, Fish simply danced The bundle of Jams Trey had flung on his back, Made him look like a traveler, just opening his pack. His eyes how they sparkled! his gingerness so merry! His cheeks were like roses are free, his nose like Jerry‚Äôs! His floppy head of hair and rounded glasses framed his face And his beard was red as though he ran like an antelope to get to this place

The stump of Mike‚Äôs bass was held tight in his hands It fucked my face with the smoke, it was something quite grand; Page had a smiling face and a nice new shirt on his chest, And when he laughed it was like he had just Brought in the Dude his absolute best! Fish was chubby and stout, like a hellborn child elf, And I laughed when I saw him and I enjoyed myself; A wink of his eye and a hi-hat intro, And soon I realized I had to surrender to the flow

They spoke not a word, it was a silent vocal jam, And filled all the hoodies with dry good merch, hot damn! And they touched their heads as the evening shocked their brain They each gave a nod, and up the chimney they went as they came Trey sprang to the VW bus and to his team gave Reba‚Äôs whistle, And away they all flew towards the Mountains in the Mist(le) But I heard him exclaim, as some green tea he poured,

I have a 17 ft Colman lantern series camper but no vehicle. It's me and my dog, we are in need of a spiritual, kind, responsible and free spirited man or woman or a couple people who would want to share the camper and have a safe vehicle to pull it. This might be a long shot but crazier things have happened. I'm on a spiritual journey and have healing to do. I'm not looking for a relationship.  Dancing, music, nature and people filled with light and love is what my soul needs. I make art out of wood and plan to travel with some tools and supplies. I am a 43 year old woman, used to travel with the dead and no stranger to being a gypsy. I don't drink, but 420 friendly and  enjoy psychedelics. 
 I need to pick up the camper and the truck will need a hitch and sway bar. Also I need to get a generator so my dog can be in the a.c. while in shows. This trip is a huge turning point in my life and im putting the desire out to the True Source of unconditional love to find a person or people to become friends, family and possible business partners with for how ever long it's a blessing to us all.

I think it's crazy coincedence that he'll be arriving to NY the day I leave- so I want to just say FUCK IT and get tix and use every last bit of vacation to attend- logistics is how to get myself to the fest and back for a flight Sunday (have to leave the fest a bit early Sunday but I think it's worth it to attend)  

 \&amp;nbsp;  

I have a decent amount of money- but not enough to fly myself with a private jet. Probably 80-150 each way to Watkins I could spend. Would you do it? Find a way to get there no matter what? Greyhound bus is a possibility- but I'm nervous about all the transfers- it's kinda  mess to catch connecting bus /walk to next spot/etc etc.  Thanks yall",phish,1531931014,ccsunflowr,12,0,True,2018-07-18

Stereo panning in the SB mix.,"Relistening to Free with headphones and it appears there is some kind of stereo panning happening with Trey's flange effect laden solo starting around 4:56. At 6:36, it becomes localized and the panning stops when he switches effects. 

Either the mixer is having some post-show fun,  or it's somehow going into the mixing board in a way that separates the single signal. Can an audiophile with better ears than mine tell me how they are achieving this effect? ",phish,1531933418,Figgywithit,4,2,True,2018-07-18

"The Scientific, Indisputable, and Completely Not-Subjective Rankings of Phish's Studio Albums","1. Rift (18 points)
2. Billy Breaths (17 points)
T3. Farmhouse (15 points)
T3. The Story of the Ghost (15 points)
T5. A Picture of Nectar (12 points)
T5. Junta (12 points)
T5. Hoist (12 points)
T5. Lawn Boy (12 points)
T9. Joy (11 points)
T9. Fuego (11 points)
11. Undermind (10 points)
12. Big Boat (9 points)
13. Round Room (2 points)

My scientific and completely not-subjective methodology: I listened to each album all the way through in a single sitting and then rated the album on a scale of 1-5 in three separate categories (Cohesiveness, Accessibility, and Originality). The most cohesive album (Rift) was the one where the songs all seemed to fit together most naturally; the least cohesive albums (Junta, Lawn Boy, and A Picture of Nectar) were more like sushi-pizza (they combine things I like, but that had no earthly business being combined). Accessibility measured how likely someone who wasn't already a Phish fan or on a variety of substances was to be able to get into the album. I don't know about you, but if you're telling me I need to snort some horse tranqs to unlock the transcendental musings of an album, I WILL DEFINITELY snort some horse tranqs (but I'm not giving it a high accessibility score). Originality took into consideration how unique the songwriting was relative to other bands as well as to Phish's own existing catalogue. But much like sushi pizza, originality on its own doesn't always equal good. Now, if you mix sushi-pizza with horse tranqs, you might have something.

Additionally, I rated each song on each album on the Y.E.M. scale. As in: Y = Yea, this is great! +1 point. E = Ehh, this isn't great, but it's not bad either. 0 points. M = Meh, this sucks chode. -1 point. I thought this was a good way to reward albums that had great songs and punish Round Room. I'm kidding. But not really. In any case, an album's total point value was the sum of their Cohesiveness, Accessibility, and Originality scores combined with their net Y.E.M. score.

I should also add, my enjoyment of a song had nothing to do with how much or little I like to hear it live. For example, I'd MUCH rather get a Tweezer at a show than a Bouncing Around the Room, but the former got an E and the latter got a Y, because studio albums are, by definition, not shows. In fact, sometimes I felt obligated to penalize an album if it was trying too hard to capture Phish's live sound at the expense of the aforementioned criteria.
 
Finally, you're entitled to disagree with my ratings. In fact, as I was going through it, I kind of disagreed with some of it and if I did it over or started in a different order (I went chronologically), things would probably be different. But they're not, because this is science and if you disagree with me, your opinion is wrong. But as long as you're polite, you'll get an upvote from me anyway.

I need a Phish pen pal.,"I love Phish. It's 80 percent of the music I hear. I drive my co workers crazy playing it everyday and asking their opinions when they clearly don't care. I text my friends who are casual fans about it and they also have very little interest. I write a Phish song of the day email and currently have four people that are willing to humor me with it but I'm sure it's just a daily delete email. I've got 65 days of Phish shows (6,000 songs) on my computer with probably another 1,000 songs that I just haven't categorized the way I like them. In summary, I'd like someone else to talk to occasionally about the band and their songs that can at least fake interest. Obviously I like the band as a whole and I'm enjoying finding myself liking songs I didn't used to like as I grow as a person. Light and Wading In the Velvet Sea are both examples of this.

It remains to be seen. I much prefer writing emails as opposed to working within reddit's editor. But if you like the idea and you want in email me at int4rweb@gmail.com and I'll put you on the list. Anyway, this is basically a copypasta of today's email:

Well, what started as a way for me to introduce Phish to my friend Nick has quickly evolved into a fairly decent sized almost daily email. It's primary purpose is for me to jack my mack off about Phish once per day in some form or another. The emails will vary in quality and length depending on how much I've had to drink and the time of day, not unlike Phish's music. But without futher ado I'd like to welcome some of you to your first Phish Song of the Day (or automatically deleted) email. We're going to start with one of my all time favorite songs: Vultures.

It's not an all together common song but it has all the elements of Phish songs that I enjoy. It starts out with rippling pianos and soaring high guitar notes. It's typically used as a mid set one rocker, the Vultures have only come looking for dead carriage 5 times in the second set. For me in evokes a feeling of being encircled, not unlike vultures themselves. The lyrics discus timing, expectations and those expectations not being met. The song itself has never, and probably never will, make it onto an official Phish album. The round of songs it debuted with all ended up on Ghost. My one and only Vultures experience was 2012/07/01 at Alpine Valley.

Statistics:  
Vulture's debuted June 6, 1997It was played at 2.15% of live Phish shows.
It was last played July 29, 2017, which was 13 shows ago.

There have been 668 shows since the live debut.

Vultures has been played approximately once every 46.5 shows.

Since its debut, Vultures has been played, on average, once every 17.1 shows.
It's been played 12 times since the band reunited in 2009.

Our Vultures is coming from 1997/07/02 where it was played after Ginseng Sullivan and before a very short Water in the Sky. It's part of the Amsterdam box set. Since they're averaging playing the song about about once per year where will the Vultures land this year? Hopefully on me.

Phish Song of the Day #9: Brother,"As I've stated in the previous PSOTD post these are basically copy pastas from the PSOTD emails I send out. Please ignore any formatting errors, I do my best to make it look correct within reddit but sometimes this website just wants to be difficult. Also, I'll try to change the syntax to correctly reflect this as a forum post and not an email, but there's no promises that I get everything. If you're interested in receiving the emails just PM me your email address or send me an email at int4rweb@gmail.com. I'm more likely to keep up with the emails than the daily post but so far I'm posting them back to back so I'm on a roll. Without Furthur ado, here's your Phish Song of the Day #9:

Obviously you all just received the last PSOTD about 6 hours ago, but technically it's a new day (2018/06/10) and I know for a fact at least one of you is in Europe so it's basically Monday already. As I expressed to almost everyone involved these will come at you fairly sporadically. At worst five days a week. At best seven; and in a perfect world we will go seven for seven AND have the emails be coherent. For now, we're falling somewhere in the middle. I actually had a different song in mind for today other than the one I ultimately ended up choosing. But it's fathers day so I picked Brother. And yes, I'm aware I missed out on a perfect opportunity to pick the 2011/06/19 Harpua where they brought out their fathers. I'm saving Harpua for later.

I actually don't have too much to say about Brother. It's not really a song I like very much, and when I say that I mean in relation to other Phish songs. Obviously I like Brother more than say, [Despacito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk). There are some songs that I feel would be better served without lyrics and Brother is one of them. I dig the guitar riff and I really enjoy the way Fishman hammers homes the high-hats. Gordon's bass line is thumping and Page is hitting the organs hard. It helps create a real sense of anxiety, as if somebody definitely is about to jump into the tub with your brother. The definitive version of Brother for me comes in the form of [1998/04/04](https://wetransfer.com/downloads/90acb5bb2537e692b24a771fa87f73ad20180610061136/93a0f1) where they not only play the full version but the radio friendly version as well. Starting on Fathers Day 2009 the band had all of their children jump into an onstage bath tub, while playing Brother solidifying the song as a fathers day tradition (at least from 09-12). I've included the [2012/06/17](https://wetransfer.com/downloads/b34a2b2b5169e7e28e4407d2aa7a3c5420180610060700/c4535c) show opening Brother because it has them introducing their children. There's video of this performance that can be found in the history section of this email or on YouTube. The writing credits for Brother are attributed to the whole band, so who knows which member is actually responsible for the phrase ""someone is definitely jumping in the tub with your brother/cousin/mother"". It appears to be split pretty evenly between the first and second set in terms of when it's performed. So, much like your own siblings, it's kind of a crap-shoot on where it's going to end up.

Statistics:               
It was played at 3.25% of live Phish shows.             
It was last played December 30, 2017, which was 1 shows ago.           
There have been 1,240 shows since the live debut.            
Brother has been played approximately once every 30.7 shows.      
Since its debut, Brother has been played, on average, once every 21 shows.

We work with the [Work Exchange Team](https://www.workexchangeteam.com/init.action?active=home), the company in charge of the FanStaff team at Curveball and various other festivals throughout summer and into fall. We've been managing FanStaff at Phish events for years now, and as I'm sure some of you already know, Watkins Glen is such an awesome place for the Phish festival. We truly look forward to Phish events and can't wait to get out there and jam out with you all!

We're reaching out today because we're searching for FanStaff who would like to work at Curveball!

**If you've never worked with the Work Exchange Team, it works like this:** Members of FanStaff will purchase a discounted staff ticket (WETicket) for $160 and are then paid for their hours worked at $10.40/hr to help reimburse themselves for the ticket. A WETicket ensures event access while not working, a spot to camp, and a FanStaff t-shirt. FanStaff can expect to work two six-hour shifts (12 total) - some will work a bit more and some a bit less. A paycheck will then be mailed following the end of the event. With this said, you do not have to purchase a WETicket if you would just like to work and not attend the event, camp, etc.

**It essentially provides a way for fans to attend events for next-to-nothing in exchange for working a few shifts at the event. With the price of event tickets consistently growing higher and higher, FanStaff provides a way for fans to attend on a budget! And it's always a good time working in exchange for music with like-minded people.**

Being a part of FanStaff offers an exciting look into the inner-workings of what all has to come together to create a one-of-a-kind experience for event attendees. If you‚Äôre someone with a positive attitude who enjoys working with others toward a common goal, you should definitely consider working with us. We would love to have you!

I will answer some questions in the comments if you have any, but you can also reference the FAQ on the [Work Exchange Team webpage for Curveball](https://www.workexchangeteam.com/goEvents.action?eventsID=449). Please feel free to email us directly as well at wet@workexchangeteam.com.

Have a good time and be safe at the shows this summer guys, hopefully we will see some of you at Curveball as well! See ya!

PSOTD #10: Twenty Years Later,"As I've explained in the past two posts these are just copy pastas from a mostly daily email I run. If you want on that list, email me at int4rweb@gmail.com because at some point I liable to give up on writing the email and making a post because I have to fight with the format when I copy-pasta it over. Anyway, here's your dose:

Before we really dive into this I'd like it to be known that I'm not the biggest 3.0 guy and as a result of that this daily email thread won't be filled with too many recent phish efforts. At least until I feel like I've exhausted everything else. I just tend to like my Phish lyrics a little more non-linear and as they've grown older and gained more perspective the songs have become less abstract. However, I have chilled out on my militant dislike of almost all things Joy related. I've referred to it in the past as rehab Phish, but now having gone through my own rehab experiences I can at least relate to it a little bit more. I also happened to see a lot of Phish in 2009/2010 and they really just drove the Joy train home. Anyway with all that being said today we're doing [Twenty Years Later](https://we.tl/HSPCz3uvb5).

The song is a Marshall/Anastatio effort that makes appearances almost exclusively in the second set. Lyrically the song rattles off a series of experiences, choices and ideas that had led to them being where they are today. Your past experiences help shape who you are as a person, but just because you've been through one thing doesn't mean something else isn't on the horizon. There is always another challenge and always something that will you leaving feeling upside down. Just getting up each day and greeting it with positive energy and a will to be productive can be a challenge for some people. At least I know it is for me, and Twenty Years Later puts that into perspective. That all being said, I actually hope I see Twenty Years Later this year.

Our Twenty Years Later comes from [2013/10/29](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-october-29-2013-the-santander-arena-reading-pa-usa.html?highlight=629) in Reading, PA. Typically they play about an 8-9 minute straight forward version of the song. In this case we have a 14 minute masterpiece sandwiched between Taste and Piper

PSOTD #11: Lengthwise,"I'll try to post these everyday, if you want a more direct version email me at int4rweb@gmail.com and I'll put you on the actual email list, this may be the last time I use this forward as I'd imagine anyone who wants in has seen one of the posts over the last four days. Direct copypasta from the emails below:

Well, I promised you guys some Phish ballads this week and I'm nothing if not a man of my word. I was thinking about it though and mentally I can really only string together so many emotionally draining Phish songs in a row. In fact, as it turns out, my mental limit is one. It doesn't mean that I won't ever feed you guys some bullshit ballads (I'm looking at you Miss You), it just means that you won't get multiple ones in a row. Also I can't always provide you with long and fantastic jams on a daily basis. Today's song isn't a long one, it's not jammed out and in fact it isn't really a ballad to begin with. It is the Jon Fishman written and sung: [Lengthwise](https://we.tl/zTM3Uts6fO).

Lengthwise doesn't get much play in the Phish rotation. The majority of the times it's been played have been in between Hold Your Head Up during the initial Rift run. It has featured Fishman fucking around on his vacuum. In the 3.0 era it's been played all of six times four of those times it has been played in front of Maze. There's a kind of anomaly version of Lengthwise from [1998/07/28](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-28-1998-sandstone-amphitheatre-bonner-springs-ks-usa.html?highlight=331) that has the songs sandwiched in-between It's Ice with Fishman singing the song into his electrolux. The lyrics themselves are essentially a one sentence story that almost everyone who has ever shared a bed with someone can relate to. The band tends to play around with a little bit musically, having played it reggae style, or changing the lyrics (especially during the 2012 summer of tuck) or bringing out Fishmans Mom to play the vacuum. It's usually a second set song. Today we're sampling a first set, show opening, Lengthwise from [1993/08/13](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-august-13-1993-murat-theatre-indianapolis-in-usa.html?highlight=331) that segues into Llama. To be honest I'd have chosen the one in-between It's Ice but I can't find a soundboard of it and I just like fairly high quality audio. If you have the will, go seek that version out too.

Statistics:                                                                 
It was played at 1.6% of live Phish shows.

Just a little bit of housekeeping here too, I'm not sure what all it is you guys are looking for out of these emails besides basically a daily Phish song. I'm mostly staying away from the songs that get played frequently and debated about all the time. At some point, obviously, I'm going to have to start doing those songs because there are only a finite amount of Phish songs. Also if you have some kind of request or something email it to me. Otherwise it's about to be the blind leading the blind out here and you're all at the mercy of whatever Phish song I feel emotionally bonded to on that particular day. They won't all be deep cuts though and as I said earlier there won't be a lot of 3.0 songs, at least not for a while. I pretty much intend to use this email system to keep me occupied and focused on not fucking my life up until I fly out to Vegas (135 days). So I'd like to thank you all for indulging me in my little daily Phish jerk session. Until tomorrow!

PSOTD #12: Sanity,"This is a section of a weekly email I send out, to be subscribed to the email drop me message at int4rweb@gmail.com. I'm trying out posting them here for a week to see what kind of response I get and may or may not continue to cross post to reddit. I will, however, continue to the email for a minimum of 19 more weeks.

Few songs really encapsulate the feeling of utter confusion that can occur to you at a Phish show like [Sanity](https://we.tl/37BNDLyeQb). I feel like I used that word incorrectly but I'm rolling with it. Sanity is written by The Dude of Life and was performed with decent moderation from 1986-1992 (20 times). The doors the asylum have only opened another 20 times in the following 26 years. For the last six years or so it's been used as a first set tone setter but prior to that it was a second set or encore song. Either way it gives the listener a shot at reflecting on who you are and what led you to this point. Musically it's played about the same way every time but it has large almost schizophrenic feeling swings portraying a feeling of calm that quickly changes to total insanity. I love this song, I saw it at Deer Creek as the first song of an encore and it just blew my mind. Recently (2013/2014/2016) the song has been a mainstay at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium so if you're at those two shows (41 and 42 days from now) be sure to keep your wits about you. Today's dose of Sanity comes from [1995/12/31](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-december-31-1995-madison-square-garden-new-york-ny-usa.html?highlight=486) where it was settled in between YEM and Frankenstein deep in the third set. It undoubtedly left the audience feeling as if their mind had a mind of it's own.

Statistics      
It was played at 2.21% of live Phish shows.    
It was last played August 6, 2017, which was 7 shows ago.    
There have been 1,729 shows since the live debut.

reservations at Mark Twain Motor Inn for Curveball,"Hi, I made a motel reservation at the Mark Twain Motor Inn in Elmira NY for 2 nights during Curveball (check in Friday 8/17, check out Sunday 8/19).  The motel is 20 miles from the venue (30m drive) and the rate (total for 2 nights) is $179.20.

It turns out that I cannot attend Curveball this year, so I plan to cancel my motel reservation.  At the time I booked the reservation in March, it was the last available reservation at any hotel/motel within a 30 mile radius of the venue.

Before I cancel the reservation, I figured I would reach out to see if anyone wants to take this reservation from me?  Not sure how it would work, but I think if we coordinated (i.e. I cancel online, then you call to book right away), you could basically take the reservation from me before it goes to someone else.

Not asking for any additional money or anything, just looking to help out a phellow phan.

I'd like to cancel and be done with it by the end of the month, so if I do not hear back from someone by July 1st, I will just cancel the reservation online.

Today's song has pretty much all of my favorite elements of Phish songs. It has nonsensical lyrics that still kind of makes sense in a meta way. It has oscillations. It has great type II potential. You can listen to how it evolved lyrically and musically over time, and it has a decent job and is willing to support me financially. Of course, I'm talking about [Carini](https://we.tl/8635UiiiRi). 

The song debuted in 1997 in Europe, you can hear it on the Amsterdam 97 box set with the original lyrics, we'll get to the lyrics (we'll get to the lyrics change in a second) The song itself is named after Fishmans old drum tech Pete Carini. Carini himself was fairly militant about the stage set up and really didn't like it when people would get overzealous and hop on stage. In multiple shows you can hear the band gleefully tell the crowd Carini's gonna get you. There are many elements of the song itself that reference the man directly (obviously), and I'm going to directly quote the Phish.net history here because I just couldn't write it better myself. ""According to reports from tapers on the Europe tour, the song was actually inspired by an incident on that tour in which a college-aged female fan was enjoying an up-front view of Page before being told to move, because she was interfering with monitor man Pete Schall‚Äôs sight lines. Her angry refusal apparently included a threat to call her influential parents resulting in the lyrics: He went across the street and he called his dad / now you‚Äôll never get that raise you thought you had."" One last Carini altercation led to a change in the first line of the first verse of the song. The original lyrics were: I saw you with Carini and that piece of ass/you built your house with windows but those windows had no glass. On 1998/11/06 a streaker jumped up on stage and was tackled by Carini. The next show (1998/11/08) at the UIC Pavilion the lyrics were irreversibly and forever changed to: I saw with you Carini and the naked dude/I couldn't eat my food. You can read about, and watch the referenced altercation [here](https://www.jambase.com/article/naked-dude-jumps-stage-phish-show-madison-1998). The writing credits are given to the whole band, so it appears to have been a group effort.

When the lump first sprouted the doctor could locate it in the first set. As the lumps grew (and thankfully didn't metastasize) the song was moved to the second set. On rare occasions they have been using it as an opener (2016/10/31, 2017/12/31). Our lump is a 21 minute behemoth that opened the second set on 2017/07/16 (Northerly Island, Chicago). The reason I'm picking it is because I was listening to it so hard that I almost fell of my bicycle (more on my bicycle later). It's not like I had a [shortage](https://imgur.com/a/VU4SL7C) of options to choose from though. ‚Äã‚Äã

Give me your favourite Hose moments,"From .net

Trey: ""We actually have exercises that we do, where we work on improving our improvising as a group. It gets rid of the ego. It's an exercise to get rid of the ego. And the more that we do it the more we find that our improvisations are less concerned with showing off flashy solos or whatever, and more concerned with making a group sound. There's a feeling that we always talk about. When we went out with Santana, he had brought up this thing about the Hose. ... where the music is like water rushing through you and as a musician your function is really like that of a hose. And, and well his thing is that the audience is like a sea of flowers, you know, and you're watering the audience. But the concept of music going through you, that you're not actually creating it, that what you're doing is -- the best thing that you can do is get out of the way. So, when you are in a room full of people, there's this kind of group vibe that seems to get rolling sometimes.""

Mike: ""It gets -- It really starts to seem like It's not the audience or the band. This Thing that gets rolling is It's OWN Thing. When things are going really well, and a jam has taken off, there's this feeling of motion that is created by the rhythm. And at that point my bass that I'm playing feels like this sortof vehicle, or like a hitch for me to hold on to, like someone would hold on to a um ... Like if you were on a -- I was thinking if you were on a ski lift, maybe. A chair lift. Or just something that would hook you on to the motion that's going, and pull you along with IT.""

PSOTD #14: Driver,"Alright guys, these will likely stop somewhere around the 26 because I'm starting a new job and won't have time to post to reddit everyday. I'll still write the emails because I can save them as a draft the night before and hit sent. To get on the list email me at int4rweb@gmail.com, now here's what you came for.

Have you ever stopped to think about all of the decisions in your life that have led up to you reading this email? What about why did I eat all that? Or how did I end up in bed with a 55 year old woman that has five cats? These are all questions that today's song will not answer directly but can at least provide some insight to. Come along with me and I'll guide you through it. I'll send an uber, it'll pick you up at 8 as usual, today were talking about [Driver](https://we.tl/rUU7d4XVY0).

Driver is a Trey and Tom song that relays the story of the 'person' behind the person. In terms of lyrical transparency it's actually pretty obvious what it's about. Everyone has been there, whether it's not remembering why you came into a room or just feeling silly about past decisions. Those examples, and just about every other decision, can be accredited to your Driver. I like to pretend as if mines one of the [Arquilian](https://imgur.com/a/OCG9ztL) from Men in Black. Personally, I really like Driver and don't mind seeing it, the story is so simple and easy to connect with. It's played the same way every time (occasionally with Trey on acoustic guitar) and clocks in at just about 4 minutes. It's also almost always in the first set, except for during the year 2000 when it was used as an encore multiple times. It's been an encore twice in 3.0 (2009/11/01 and 2012/12/31). The last time it was played was The Gorge 2016. Judging by the statistics we're due for this nice little first set breather. Today's Driver is coming from [2000/09/14](https://phish.net/setlists/phish-september-14-2000-darien-lake-performing-arts-center-darien-center-ny-usa.html?highlight=177), it was the first song of an encore before The Inlaw Josie Wales. It's the same as the Driver's before it, after it and presumably the ones yet to come.

Statistics:          
It was played at 1.76% of live Phish shows.             
It was last played July 16, 2016, which was 55 shows ago.              
There have been 567 shows since the live debut.             
Driver has been played approximately once every 56.7 shows.               
Since its debut, Driver has been played, on average, once every 17.7 shows.
It was played 32 times.

9 Years Ago Today I Saw My First Phish Show,"For a little subtext.  I got into Phish in around 2004.  I had seen the Dead for the first time that summer at the Gorge (with the Allman Brothers Band), and to me, it seemed like there were not many people at the show considering it was the Grateful God Damn Dead, and I was like ""where is everyone"", and people were like ""Oh, everyone's out on the East Coast seeing Phish play their last shows""...and I'm like ""Who the fuck is Phish and why would anyone go see them instead of the Dead""....so when I got home I started listening to a couple Phish shows and, yeah, next thing I know it turns out Phish is the band I'd been searching for my whole life.  

I tried so hard for Hampton tickets, but after realizing it was never happening for me I focused on figuring out a way to make sure I got to see some peak Phish, and what better place to see some rarities and bust outs than Star Lake?  So, my first Phish run was Star Lake &gt; Deer Creek &gt; Alpine x 2 in the summer of '09.   It was a feat coming from the Canadian prairies.  Ended up flying in and out of Chicago and renting a car for the run.  We pretty much had nothing else planned.  No rooms booked, or really anything figured out.  We just slept in the car two nights and then got a room somewhere about 45 minutes from Alpine for the last two shows.

Anyway, this was the first show and the cool part is it was all ""old school"" 1.0 Phish stuff, aside from Alaska.  I'm not going to say this was peak Phish.  I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't actually think their first Phish show was like ""best show ever"" type stuff.  They weren't really jamming yet.  I think the first truly great Phish show I saw was probably at the Gorge later that summer, and honestly, I think they've continually gotten better since then.  Some other highlights for me over the years have been Vegas 14/16, Dicks '11-'15, MGS '13 and really Lockn '16 was great too, especially because I got to see Ween open for Phish, hearing Phish cover Ween was one of those things that got me into Phish in the first place...so that was great.

But looking back on it, this was a great show.  It didn't have that Harpua or those really rare songs that of course you're not going to get at your first show, but that Encore was really awesome and YEM was definitely an epic thing to see live.  

Anyone else make it out to this one?

It had a version of Foam on it that was almost like classical fucking music. Trey and page went back, channeled Mozart, and slapped Chopin on the way. She gave me the CD. I lost it. I know I'll have to listen to hundreds of versions of foam just to find that one. It was worth it. I hear it all the time!

PSOTD #17: Golgi Apparatus,"How'd we get to 17? Well, I missed a couple days (Spock's Brain and Bold as Love). I've just been running a little late in the morning and that doesn't leave me time to take the email and turn it into a reddit post. I'm also going out of town tomorrow until the 24. I have drafts written up for the email but it's not likely I'll be able to cross post on to here. If you want a PSOTD email, email me at int4rweb@gmail.com to sign up.

Today's song is very special to me. It's the first Phish song I ever heard. We all have one, and this one is mine. Ironically, it was shown to me by my eighth grade biology teacher who I still see at shows damn near twenty years later (bless up, Mr. Harper!). Keep a tight grip on your proteins (and ticket stubs) we're talking about [Golgi Apparatus](https://we.tl/iCykoTsliO). For reference, the Golgi Apparatus that I first heard was the second set opening Golgi that led into a Gamehedge suite from [1993/03/22](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-march-22-1993-crest-theatre-sacramento-ca-usa.html).

Golgi is a very, very old Phish song. In fact on the liner for the Junta cassette tape I have it says that Tom and Trey wrote the song when they were in 8th grade. Phish.net says it was written by Trey, Tom, Dave Abrahams and Aaron Woolf in biology class, while learning about Golgi Apparati(us'?). Golgi debuted in 1986 and has pretty much been a  staple in the Phish rotation ever since. It is a structured song and rarely ja med out, they use it heavily as a set opener or closer and encore. Today's Golgi comes from [1998/07/06](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-06-1998-lucerna-theatre-prague-czech-republic.html?highlight=234) in the Czech Republic. It's a first set closer with Hip Hip Hooray quotes at the end.

Statistics:               
It was played at 25.25% of live Phish shows.                  
It was last played December 31, 2017, which was 0 shows ago.             
There have been 1,730 shows since the live debut.

The Mount Rushmore of Phish Jams,"I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/phish/comments/8sblzm/where_to_next/?st=jim9wtq6&amp;sh=1dc67158 and someone) and in the comments someone had listed six must-listen to jams; someone else called it the Mount Rushmore of Phish. But as we all know, Mount Rushmore only has four presidents on it. So that got me thinking about what would be the actual Mount Rushmore of Phish jams. And if you're gonna do a Mount Rushmore jam list, I think you gotta match the songs to the presidents. Here's my little stab at it:

**G. Washington = [the Murat Gin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4aN3bijdiM):** Surely the Riverport or Went Gins are better than Murat you're saying and you're probably right, but George Washington wasn't the greatest American president; he was the first president. And much like Washington paved the way for Jefferson and Lincoln, the Murat Gin paved the way for its better known successors and other full-band explorations. 

**T. Jefferson = [the Albany YEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXgh2Zmzlxc):** Jefferson was our third president and I'd argue our first truly great one. The Albany YEM wasn't the first BIG Phish jam, but I'd argue it was the first truly transcendent one. It went places no other YEM had ever been to or gone to since.

**A. Lincoln = [the Denver Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_FBtQUh0tE):** Lincoln was arguably our greatest president, so this was by far the most challenging pick. After several minutes of deliberation, I went with the Denver Ghost. Why? It's 21 minutes of perfection. I can't find a flaw in it. Just like I can't find a flaw in Lincoln's character. Maybe you could say the same thing about the Went Gin, but I already gave it a shout-out, so I went with this. Also, I like to imagine that after Lincoln was assassinated, he came back in ghost form to melt the faces of spun hippies... just like this Ghost. 

**T. Roosevelt = [the Tahoe Tweezer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eBibggCibE):** Roosevelt is not only the most recent president included on Mount Rushmore, but also the most controversial pick. But whether you love him or think he's kinda over-rated, it's clear that the guy was a total bad-ass... much like the Tahoe Tweezer.",phish,1529451227,CatFacedBoy,100,145,True,2018-06-19

2.0 Songs such as Waves, Seven Below, Pebbles and Marbles, Scents and ASIHTOS are held near and dear to many of us as 03/04 were many people's first shows. Nothing makes me more giddy then hearing them still.

Public Disclaimer/Warning to Those Who Still Own LivePhish CDs,"Howdy Pholks, long time no see. How's everybody doing? 

I just wanted to post this to alert people who still own any of the original ""LivePhish"" series on CD, that if they have been stored, ""Improperly"" for lack of a better word I guess, the discs will start to develop a sticky, icky film on both the label side and the music side. 

I have a dedicated hard drive for shows, with a lot of really good SBDs, and I'm always looking for upgrades. Today I pulled out around 10 LivePhish CDs to rip and upgrade those shows to the SBDs.

I never got into the whole idea of the ""Binder"", unfolding the four disc plastic casing with the 3-hole punch, instead just keeping them folded up in the cardboard sleeve. They sat on a CD shelf with the rest of my CD collection. ~70 degrees F, no direct sunlight, just tucked neatly on the shelf.

Anyway, today I noticed nearly all of the discs have this nasty stuff all over them, that would resemble something like dried maple syrup, but clear in color. I was afraid to put any of them in my laptop lest they fuck up my optical drive. I tried washing, rinsing, and wiping them, but there was still a lot of residue. This stuff is like superglue.

So if anyone out there is still holding on to any of these CD releases (I forget how many volumes they released), and are storing them folded up in the cardboard sleeve, you might want to go check and see if this same strange phenomena has happened to your discs as well. 

It's kinda sad that I have a bunch of great shows in SBD that are now unlistenable.

If anyone has experienced this and found a way to properly clean them, let me know!

See y'all on tour.

Phish in Camden: A History,"Like just about all Phish fans, I am eagerly waiting to see what this summer has in store for us. In particular, I‚Äôm anticipating the band‚Äôs arrival in Camden, NJ for a two night stand in early August, the only shows I‚Äôll be seeing this year. Out of equal parts curiosity and boredom, I thought it might be fun to take a look back at Phish‚Äôs storied history at this particular venue. What follows is a brief (and subjective) commentary on each of the the shows played in Camden to date. Please feel free to chime in with your thoughts, memories, and corrections. 

First a little background..

The venue in Camden (capacity ~25.5k with 7k in the shed) has gone by various names over the years. It began its life as the E-Centre in the 1.0 era and then hosted Phish 2.0 as the Tweeter Center. By the time the band reunited in 2009, they were playing the Susquehanna Bank Center. As of 2015, the venue has been called the BB&amp;T Pavilion. One side of the concert grounds faces the Delaware river waterfront and boasts panoramic views of my hometown of Philadelphia. On the other side is, well, Camden, New Jersey. The surrounding area is hardly scenic, and pre-show activities are confined primarily to sprawling parking lots. The venue itself can charitably be described as a ‚Äútypical Northeast shed‚Äù with little to recommend it except for the aforementioned view of the city across the river. The lawn is forgiving, with multiple good sight lines. In my experience, the sound has always been adequate.

While the concert venue may receive mixed reviews, there is little doubt about the generally high quality of the music that Phish has played there. To date, Phish has played 10 concerts in Camden, NJ. Those shows have produced no less than 33* song versions that appear on the phish.net jam chart. Of those 33, 17 are recognized as ‚Äúespecially improvisational, or otherwise notable.‚Äù 10 songs played at Camden have clocked in at 20+ minutes. (https://phish.net/jamcharts/city/Camden,+NJ)

Looking a bit deeper into the stats, we find that 6 songs have debuted in Camden, 4 of which were one-timers. More interesting to me are the often played songs that have NEVER appeared in Camden. These include: Back on the Train, Sample in a Jar, AC/DC Bag, Squirming Coil, Simple, and Carini. Chalkdust Torture and Fluffhead are somewhat over-represented, appearing 5 and 4 times out of 10 total shows, respectively.

* 2001 is counted twice on 6/25/10. Otherwise this number would be 32.

Let‚Äôs take a look at each show, shall we?

**7/10/99**

If you have only heard one show from Camden, it‚Äôs probably this one. And if you‚Äôve only heard one song from this show, it‚Äôs probably the CDT. Rightly hailed as an absolute, must-hear-at-all-cost, top shelf jam, this Chalkdust is phenomenal. It overshadows many other fine performances on this night, among them an underrated Gin, a 20 minute Tweezer, a fine BOAF, and a strong-finishing Fluffhead to close out Set 2. Phish‚Äôs first show in Camden may be their best. Officially released as Live Phish 8.

**7/3/00**

The first of a two night run, this show features a fairly song-based first set (played in the midst of a big storm) which includes another strong take on Fluffhead. Set two opens with a behemoth, nearly 33 minute Jim. There is some down time in the middle of this big jam, but the final third is more than worth the price of admission. Later, a very strong Theme shows why this show isn‚Äôt just a one trick pony. The Sand locks into the 99/00 techno groove, and your taste will dictate if it works for you or not. Overall a solid show.

**7/4/00**

Apart from some nice song choices (Lizards, TMWSIY&gt;Avenu Malkenu&gt;TMWSIY) this holiday show is rather unremarkable in the first set. Set 2, however, is another animal altogether. In a year of strong Jibboos, this version might be the granddaddy of them all. Clocking in at 28:40, this multi-part monster has something for just about everybody. Not content with this centerpiece jam, the band closes the set with an outstanding Twist&gt;Slave combo. The latter tune, in particular, is stellar and comparable in quality to 11/18/98‚Äôs masterful version.

**7/30/03**

What‚Äôs that? You were looking for a 4 song 2nd set? I‚Äôve got one right here. And yet, the arguable highlight of this show appears in Set 1,with a S&amp;SS that is in the conversation for best ever played. Set 1 also features an average length CDT that packs a punch and a one-off cover of Dylan‚Äôs You Ain‚Äôt Goin‚Äô Nowhere. Set 2 looks like this: Twist, Bug, YEM, WotC. Twist and YEM both trounce the 20 minute mark and are full of high quality improvisation. If dark 2.0 Phish is your bag, you could do a lot worse than this show.

**7/31/03**

The first set of 03‚Äôs night two is punctuated by an early Moma that gets even funkier than usual. Set 2 begins with a long piper that turns out to be somewhat restrained until the last 4 minutes where it ramps up and then calms down once more with a &gt; into Mike‚Äôs. The ensuing Paug is a fast paced jaunt with lots of full band interplay. The set ending Hood is a 26 minute Type II thriller that is easily among the best of 2.0 and well worth a listen.

**8/12/04**

The final show before Coventry, and the cracks are showing. Composed sections are noticeably weak and improvisation, while certainly present, sometimes feels aimless. Frankly, Trey isn‚Äôt quite as engaged as one would like. Set 2 opens with Piper for the 2nd consecutive Camden show and winds into an above average Sally. The S&amp;SS that ends the set is very 2.0 in style and your mileage may vary. Still worth checking out, but not a show I find myself listening to frequently.

**6/7/09**

Phish may have made their return at Hampton, but this show is when many fans knew they were BACK. This is not to say that there wasn‚Äôt still rust on the wheels. There totally was. But the extended Fee (after an almost expected lyrical flub by Trey) was a hint of what was to come. The Sand that opened Set 2 was probably the first big jam of 3.0 and it retains much of its power, especially in the last 5 minutes. Many fans (myself included) would argue that the set ENDING 17 minute Tweezer is the real MVP here. A 4-song encore that includes an Antelope &gt; Tweeprise caps things off. This show has been surpassed in 3.0 many times over but it provided a solid foundation for all that followed.

**6/24/10**

Looking at the setlist, you‚Äôd think that this show MUST have something very special to offer. DWD, C&amp;P, Hood, Fluff, and YEM all in one set? That‚Äôs crazy talk. Alas, this is a garden variety 2010 show. Not that it‚Äôs especially bad. The Gumbo &gt; Timber is nice, as is DWD -&gt; C&amp;P but this show never quite makes it to the next level. I will say this: Page did a great job with The Rover to close Set 1. I would have liked to see that Led Zep tune stay in the rotation but it was one and done.

**6/25/10**

Certainly a step up from the previous night. The band starts off with a bang by launching into Alumni &gt; Letter to Jimmy Page &gt; Alumni. The rest of Set 1 loses its way a bit (Free Man in Paris, Summer of 89, TTE) but Set 2 kicks off with a nice CDT before lulling out for a few tunes. Then a VERY welcome 2001 emerges from the ether and the dance-fest in on. This is a tight, very funky version that gives way to some fun Michael Jackson teases and jams (on the 1st anniversary of his death) before resuming 2001 proper. The Billie Jean segment is a little rough on re-listen, but I can guarantee that nobody in attendance cared one bit.

**6/10/11**

The final Camden show to date was a song based show that lacked a lot of improvisational muscle. The setlist is decidedly old school, with only one post 90s song appearing. The Curtain w/ is notable for its quality and the rarely heard Swept Away &gt; Steep is a nice touch. Otherwise, despite a late show Bowie and an even later Fluffhead, there‚Äôs not much to see here.

----------

That‚Äôs about all I‚Äôve got. It‚Äôs been 7 years since the Phish from Vermont graced the Delaware waterfront and a hell of a lot has happened with the band in that time. Be safe out on tour and I‚Äôll see you crazy kids in Camden.

PSOTD #24: Lawn Boy,"Blah blah blah, daily emails, obviously I missed the last week because I was very busy but didn't miss sending the emails. I'm late and can't type out what songs you missed but they were mostly Phish songs relating to transportation. Subscribe to my dumb email service by emailing me at int4rweb@gmail.com. 

Who doesn't like [Lawn Boy](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VXy7bxpDAzLDgdjIy_lcsYqtZzWfeBz0)? I mean really, Page comes out from behind his piano fortress and serenades us sweetly and everyone goes home happy. The song is written by Trey and Tom and is usually a straight forward kind of lounge tune. Plus you get to hear Trey call Page The Chairman of the Boards. It debuted in 1989 and has been a Phish regular pretty much ever since. They band went to far as to name an album after it for petes sake. In the past Lawn Boy could be found in the first or second set but in 3.0 it's existed pretty much exclusively in the first set. The exceptions are 2012/12/31 where it was in the third set (and acapella and they kind of had a golf theme going on that year anyway) and 2017/07/25 where it was in the first set and an encore. So really, the second one doesn't count. Speaking of [2017/07/25](http://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-25-2017-madison-square-garden-new-york-ny-usa.html?highlight=329), that's where today's Lawn Boy is coming from. We've all heard Lawn Boy and know it's similar in the way it's played. On jam night of The Bakers Dozen however, Lawn Boy launched into a fantastic jam. Plus I feel like it's been a while since I gave you guys something overly jammy. That's it for today, join me tomorrow for, who knows what. Just for clarification I wrote this email before I saw the fantastic post about this exact Lawn Boy on the front page yesterday.

PSOTD #25: All Things Reconsidered,"Unfortunately this one appears to be very, very dead (or hopefully waiting for the right time to bust it out after over 20 years). [All Things Reconsidered](https://we.tl/8DD9ohG9S1) is a straight riff(t, get it because it's on rift?) on on the All Things Considered theme song that anyone who has listened to NPR knows. It's actually still the same theme song as it was then. It debuted with It's Ice, Sparkle and PSOTD alum Brother. NPR is aware of the the song and has used it before as intro and out music. In fact, Phish played it when they were on NPR's Mountain Stage in 1992. The song was in heavy rotation in the early 90s. I actually have enjoyed listening to it the past and would be very happy to see them  play it, but Phish isn't known for going [backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGmfiKowrYU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5) very often.

PTBM Delivery - International,"Hello fellow heads,

I have instructed my flatmates to reship the tickets to my current US adress.  


Are those tickets delivered directly to the mailbox, without a signature needed? That would help, obviously, since I have no way to sign myself.

/r/phish added to the Reddit Chat Room beta,"Hi all,

So I just received this information from one of the Reddit admins:

&gt; Hi! I‚Äôm getting in touch to let you know that your subreddit has been added to an early beta of our new subreddit chat rooms feature. This means that today you‚Äôll have the ability to create both public and private chat rooms for your community. We‚Äôre rolling this out to select communities for now, and more soon.

&gt; Your community is in the second phase of our beta. We‚Äôve already worked closely with a handful of moderators and subreddits for the past two months who have created rooms for their communities, given us feedback, and continue to use the chat rooms. We encourage you to join r/community_chat to talk to them if you have questions or want to see the rooms in action. Check out [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/community_chat/comments/8465bl/welcome_to_rcommunity_chat/), or the [modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/8scfxh/new_chat_moderator_permissions_continuing_chat/) post for more infomation about subreddit chat rooms.

&gt; All the details about how chat rooms work (sample posts, recommendations, how to promote your rooms, how to create rooms, etc.) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v3DI4xBQ0bANMHFtbPmTMZGP4wUamnn9uHnft2A96II/edit?usp=sharing), and you can join r/community_chat to talk to other people and communities who are also part of this beta.


This could be pretty cool for couch-touring / setlist threads. 

Open to any suggestions for future room creations and how we want to utilize this new feature.

I created a test room for now just to get things going and have people check it out.

"There seems to be two major schools of Phish fans when it comes to how their studio albums and their signature sound are heard: those who came in around Junta/Lawnboy, and those who came in around Hoist (DWD).","This may already be well-covered, but I wanted to share, as it's something I have been thinking about for a while.

Early adopters seem to generally rate Junta or Rift as there best studio album. 

Hoist era adopters seem to generally rate the best studio album as Ghost.

With Hoist, Phish took a turn from challenging prog rock, and embraced more of a straight rock sound. It was still quirky, jammy Phish, but it was an obviously huge pivot point from their previous sound. After Hoist a more ballady and slower jamming Phish emerged.  

That's not to say that their slow down after the radio rocky Hoist didn't produce more brilliance of its own.

I think that those of us who came in early, came to expect the challenging prog sound of Junta, PON, and Rift, and though we enjoy the post-Hoist music in its own right, and may even have replaced Junta/Rift with Ghost or another as our favorite studio album, our perspective and expectation of Phish's sound revolves around our entry point prior to Hoist.

Fans who came in during Hoist or after, seem to have a very different perspective of the quintessential Phish Sound that made them so popular in the Junta-Rift days. Not to say that is a negative thing. It is simply different, and I find it fascinating to imagine coming into Phish from that angle.",phish,1530226068,EritSanguis,11,8,True,2018-06-28

Does anyone agree how ridiculously amazing the album Rift is?,"Just listening again...few amazing points

There's almost no extra production quality and totally organic yet creating such a giant sound.  It's basically Page on an acoustic piano with an occasional hammond, and Trey has almost no effects the entire album besides distortion.   

The compositions are the perfect balance between old Phish - lite sounds, thought out compositions; and new phish pop and hard jam.  

Every Tune stands aside from every other album ever.  Every song is uniquely Rift...if that makes sense.  The whole album has it's own mood.

Such a crisp recording.  Its really refreshing that to hear just the instruments ring over such complex compositions.  It creates such a unique sound.

Fucking Fish.  It's so amazing the beats and ingenuity he brings to this.  Obviously I love him,  but this may be his best effort of any album...Rift... Silently in the Morning,  Maze, Wedge....its all so revolutionary.  Literally the best drumming on an entire album I can think of.

I don't like flying across the country to wing it, but at the same time I feel pretty confident that all three of us can get in the door for 40 or under (a piece) by seeing what we can find in the lot. It's also not out of the question to buy tickets at this point, but chasing them down is part of the fun. My Uncle said the parking lot there is big and spacious so I'd assume that also means there's a lot scene. Near as I can tell it isn't sold out and I'm not sure if it will or not. There's already a decent amount of tickets up on cash or trade.

Ideally, I'd sell it for face or slightly less, but I don't know how festival ticket supply and demand works as we get closer to the show itself. (I am new to the Phish game and I'm not sure if it is realistic to hold out another few months or if I should take an offer for ~$50 less than face.)

Jon The Phishhead (Mom) - A Primus parody song,"https://youtu.be/lkFMJ4-ai1I
Based on a true story. 07/03/12

When he was young you'd not find him doing well in school.
His mind had turned to the guitar though.
Always so focused on music, computers, and school.
He has no time for Jewish daughters. 
Alienated from the clique society,
A lonely boy finds peace in Phishheads.
His mother says ""JON THIS IS NOT THE WAY LIFE'S SUPPOSED TO BE! 
Don't you see the life that you're missing?""

And he says: 
""When I grow up I want to be
One of those unkempt neo-hippies.
I think before my days are done,
I want to be a Phishhead Mom""

Now years gone by they buy the tickets to Jones Beach, 
They set out on a July morning.
Opens his hatchback to the small community.
Glow sticks don't sell like they had thought they would. 
Four hours up, oh the ocean swelled and swelled.
The fog rolled in it started raining.
The nitrous bust, oh my god we're going now 
Soaked to the bone the band kept playing.

As he says: 
""When I grow up I want to be, 
One of those strung out neo-hippies.
I think before my days are done, 
I want to be a Phishhead, man.
I'll live and die a Phishhead, mom.

Might be a dumb Q re: Trey's Amps,"So this might be a dumb question, but does Trey rely solely on the Tubescreamers for his overdrive? I'm pretty sure in that rig rundown video from a few years ago he states that he runs clean for most of the night. But there does seem to be a difference between, say a Runaway Jim clean sound and a Waste clean sound. Is that just pickup switching and volume knob control? Or does he switch to a slightly overdriven channel for something like Jim? 

Basically, yeah: Is he running just the clean channel \(near breakup\) on the various amps through the years and controlling the amount of dirt/gain via the two tubescreamers and the volume knob? I *think* that's what's happening, but just want to confirm. 

\(As a note: I've mostly played Solid State amps, and I'm just dipping my toe into Tube amps, likely picking up a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe soon, and just sort of wondering if I should be looking at relying more on my TS for a dirt tone.\)

Have a lot shirt idea? Let's make it happen.,"Love this community and love the creativity and cleverness that often manifests itself in tshirts sold on lot. That being said, I have the ability to upload shirt designs to Amazon that are printed on demand by Amazon after purchase (maybe others here do Merch as well?). All through Amazon, not me. Not looking to make a profit here but just legitimately would like to help anyone out in this community who is looking for a certain shirt design or has an idea for a shirt. 

The beauty here is that there is no overhead or inventory...no minimum order number...just my time investment of designing and posting the shirt design to Amazon. I can tell you that my break even point is $13 (I would otherwise price shirts above that obviously), but if you have a design that you want to see on a shirt...a new idea or perhaps a reincarnation of a favorite shirt that's on its last leg... then let me know and I'll try to design it up and post it for $13! You'll be able to buy through the convenience of Amazon Prime at your leisure.

Only stipulation is that I won't upload anything trademarked or copyrighted . Feel free to PM me if you'd rather collaborate privately. Looking forward to some cool shirts!",phish,1527043532,MoonRockCollector,45,12,True,2018-05-22

Idea for a regular (weekly? bi-weekly? monthly?) subreddit-wide event: Listening party,"One of my favorite parts of this subreddit is the live thread for people to discuss a concert as it is happening, whether on couch tour or there in person.  But what to do during the off-season, when we not only miss The Boys but we also miss sharing the experience with other phans online?  

BAM - Listening Party

We agree on a concert ahead of time, agree on a time (for instance everybody hits play simultaneously at 8pm EST) and we all listen together, enjoying a live thread where we discuss the show.  This would be a bit different from the normal live threads for a handful of reasons, including all the comments like ""Can't wait for this Gin coming up soon! One of my favorites!""

I would want to do it often enough to scratch my Phish itch, but rarely enough that people still find it interesting enough to participate.

Idea for a fantasy Phish game app,"Hi, folks. Hope you did well in the lotto! 

With so much Phish on the radar in the future, wanted to throw out an app idea I've had for a long time, with the hopes of maybe someone more talented with app dev can figure out the proper steps for bringing it to life. I think it'd be a cool \*thing\* for the community, much like Cash or Trade, [Phish.IN](https://Phish.IN), PhishTracks, etc. 

Before shows, my friends and I play a fantasy game that's very, very fun \-\- We all write down six songs that we think will pop into the setlist during the show. No one can repeat song picks and one song is a ""juicer"" that's worth 2x points. It gets pretty fun with six\-10 people and usually we attach stakes to the winner, like they get free beers from the crew during the next show, everyone throws in for merch, etc. 

We write this down on a piece of paper and then the organizer \- a commissioner, if you will \- tallies it up at the end of the show and group\-texts out the winner, since we tend to scatter. But... what if all of this was a very simple app for an iPhone, done like a fantasy draft, before each show? Folks could select from song lists, etc, with a time limit, etc. Or auto\-draft! Have to imagine that a lot of friend\-groups would play, then get notice of who the winner in the league is for that particular show. 

Just wanted to throw a vision out incase someone has a better way to run with it. I'm pretty high bandwidth with work\-related projects right now but would love to explore options for bringing it to life without incurring a lot of development expense. Feel like this is a good time to seed the idea out there before summer \+ fall tour. Would love to do what I can to help project manage, figure out resources for hosting expenses, etc.

First Phish show to show a new friend EVER?,"**tl;dr: new friend has listened ONLY to phish studio albums but never a live show. need the best live show ever to introduce him to the best way to experience this band.**

I have this new friend, and we were talking about music recently and I mentioned how much I love Phish. He said he was a fan too, and when I asked if he'd ever seen them live, he said he hadn't - and then when I asked if he'd ever heard a live show, he ALSO SAID HE HADN'T! He hasn't listened to them in a few years but seemed eager to get back into them when I talked about how special the live experience is.

I need to make things right for him and show him THE BEST introductory Phish show. I've been listening to them too long to remember the first one I heard, so I can't go off that. Would Colorado 88 be a good place to start? Or should I start with something more recent? I'm hoping this friend will join me for a show this summer so i really want to make a good impression. Maybe I should show him a show I've actually been to? Any suggestions you have would be stellar.

**Unstoppable River**

*ballad*

There is a river under the rain

I don't get high on the mountain nearby 

Some guys once asked me what kind of brain

Is in the light of the moon in the sky

.

*Chorus:*
And this river is unstoppable, we carry this tune

Upwards and upwards in the light of the moon

Fortune dwindled, broken inside

Your picture is passing through both my eyes

.

Upstream the light is passing the shore

Blazing like Roger when he left my life

Years and years older i miss you much more

Promises that no future path was right

.

And this river is unstoppable, we carry this tune

Upwards and upwards in the light of the moon

Fortune dwindled, broken inside

Your picture is passing through both my eyes

**Turning**
*3.0-style rocker*

Slowly turning

Gently burning

We keep this thing alive

Intransient feet

Rautical meat

The dinner just died

*B Section*

Black clouds on the highway

Stranded on the seas

Would you like to have your meatballs

Placed down on your feet

*A section*

Happily reeling

Tequila feelings

That you never hide

Swords of laughter

Running out after

You eat my both my eyes

*B Section*

Bouncing every morning

Shadow blooms in sight

We'll find a pebble in the sand

To keep in the light",phish,1527800710,FiveDozenWhales,31,55,True,2018-05-31

Are there any concrete reasons that Curveball would be better than Dick's? I've heard things like a secret set and/or a day set might happen at Curveball but not at Dick's? Is there anything else that I don't know about that might make one or the other an obvious choice?

Stranded on a desert island with only one month of Phish to listen to‚Ä¶,"Scenario: Imagine you are to be stranded on a desert island for the rest of your life and can only bring with you all of the music Phish performed publicly during any given month (midnight of the first day of the month to midnight of the last day of the month). Which month do you choose?

Miraculously, you are afforded the best currently available recordings of everything Phish performed live during the given month, and also whatever listening device you choose that will somehow never deteriorate.

I'm also curious how much your decision is affected by:

- the sheer volume of music that Phish performed that month

- how much of that music you originally heard live

- the variety of songs performed that month

- multiple great versions of particular songs that you love

- the era of Phish (both how they played then and what songs were then in their repertoire)

- any other considerations that I'm not thinking of

Or, if you would like me to frame it in another way: What in your opinion is the best month of Phish?

"Phish Radio - Endless phish, tailored to your liking.","Hey reddit, I posted here a few months ago announcing ""Hose"", a new phish streaming app that includes a pretty cool feature (i'm surely biased though) - Phish Radio

Feedback form - https://goo.gl/forms/Liky1bCS9Oroxr493
Website - https://hose.live/

I have been working on a phish streaming website (very similar to phish.in) for the past year or so. I pushed out a beta version a few months ago, and since then have been working tirelessly on our main feature of the application - Phish Radio.

If you login to the app (currently only supporting facebook login, we plan to get google login integrated soon as well), the app will track your listening habits, likes and dislikes, and all that sort of thing. The goal is to learn what you as a phish fan enjoy and recommend you songs using a neural network pulling from the entire category of live phish (30,000+ tracks) that was run through an audio feature extraction library. This algorithm will essentially try and find similar sounding songs that you enjoy and try to recommend them to you in a convenient ""endless radio"" feature.

This project is very exciting for me personally, and I was lucky enough to tie this project into my senior capstone project for a degree in computer science. I'm in the final stretch of the project (in the context of school), and need some people to provide some feedback on how the radio feature works out for them.

I'm coming to you guys to ask for a big favor, and possibly use the app and interact with it (Like some songs that you enjoy, browse the app and listen to some shows, but most importantly liking and disliking are key to the algorithm. I even put in like buttons around the app so you can browse songs and shows and like songs that you already know you love - because we've all got our favorites right?).

Anyway, the goal of the phish radio feature is to have a neat feature that will just endlessly play you phish. I've been using this at work when i don't want to constantly be jumping back and forth to pick the next song that I want to play. Hopefully you guys will enjoy it as much as I have been.


PS. The radio feature will still work if you're not logged in, but don't expect anything special.

How did you start listening to Phish?,"Young Phan (20) who started listening my senior year of high school, but when I heard my first Phish song I could not have guessed what an impact this music would have on me. I would love to hear how you all started listening. Word of mouth from when they first started out? Lucky enough to be in Nectar's in the early days? Friend drag you to a concert? Or just by chance? As for me I always listened to everything from the 60s to the 90s, and thanks to my parents, became a huge classic rock fan. One day we were having a garage sale to clear out all the shit in our basement and there were a ton of old CD's. I had already raided this stash a few times before but only looking for names I knew. Before we sold the CD's we felt weren't good enough or didn't want, I was picking through it one last time in case I missed anything (wound up scoring Skynyrd's One More From the Road and Floyd's Pulse live show). But then my dad handed me one more CD and goes, ""Here check these guys out, they kind of took over the mantle for the Dead after Jerry died"", so as a pretty avid Deadhead I took it with high expectations. That album just so happened to be Billy Breathes. Now I immediately fell in love with it, and when I heard Free and Theme it hit me right in that musical sweetspot, but I didn't quite get how they ""took over the Dead's mantle"". Eventually I decided to listen to a live show and that's when I had my mind implode and everything I thought I knew about music changed. Ever since I've listened non stop and Phish has quickly risen to the heights of my favorite bands and will remain there for the rest of my life. Probably not as glorious as a story as the vets here but I just wanted to share to anybody willing to listen. Please share your stories below I would love to hear about it!

Let's discuss: Scents &amp; Subtle Sounds,"If this post is successful, there will surely be more in the future!

The object is to get different points of view on the meaning of lyrics. Scents &amp; Subtle Sounds is (lyrically) in my top 3 of favorite Phish tunes, which is why I decided to start with it. Commenting with your favorite version is encouraged. 

So, without further ado:

""If you would stop and notice that we number every day. 
But allow the many moments left uncounted slip away. 

You don't have to count them, Just enjoy them one by one. 
Then things would take a different hue and sparkle in the sun. 
The winds would lift you up in to the sky. 

The winds would lift you up in to the sky above. 
Where you would see a trail of treasured memories you love. 
A rainbow record of the thoughts, and moments you've enjoyed. 
Arcs behind the earth as spectral colors in the void. 

Scents and subtle sounds. 
Colors in the void."" 



Here's my take:

The 1st verse speak of the indoctrination of the entire human race by way of numbers, specifically with the clock and calendar. Everyone blindly slaves away to these concepts, and accepts it at normal. The idea of stamping a number on each and every moment is something that was forced upon us, and we were left with no choice but to abide by it.

The 2nd verse talks about how we have the power to free ourselves from these constraints. However, doing so is (obviously) easier said than done. If you can achieve this freedom, then 'the winds would lift you up in to the sky'. It would assist us in our journey to spiritual ascension and shed a different light on what it means to be a human. 

The 3rd verse is tricky. To me, it is somewhat of a fantasy of what would happen if you were to free yourself.

Favorite version: Chicago 2017 summer tour, although I have the 'I was there' bias. It really takes off right around the 9 minute mark. It's placement in the set was nothing short of perfection.

What does this song mean to you? Does it remind you of any cherished memories? Do you have a different interpretation than I do? I'd love to hear about it. 

Thanks in advance for your responses!

Billy Breathes vinyl for Record Store Day,"I recently saw on Phish's website that they'll be releasing 7,500 copies of Billy Breathes on Vinyl. A few months back I stumbled upon a copy of Lawn Boy from the 2013 release at my local record shop for an absolute steal. I'd really like to get my hands on a copy of Billy Breathes, but I have no idea how record store day works. Do I need to call around to different shops and see if they received any copies for the release on the 21st? Or do I just need to be lucky and hope my local shop will carry it (they should considering it's in walking distance to the rhombus).

"Does the Coldplay song ""Clocks"" sound like a particular Phish song?","First, just to let you know that I am not familiar with Phish's music.  I definitely knew who they were - and knew many people that were really into them years ago.  But, I personally, never got into them, so am not familiar with their songs.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyhows, for the past several years, I have often heard the Coldplay song ""Clocks"" played in stores whenever I am shopping at the mall.  For the longest time I assumed it was a Phish song.  There was something in my memory telling me that Phish had one commercial/Top 40 song - and that this was it.

&amp;nbsp;

I just heard it played in Target yesterday and finally Google searched the name of the song, based on a few of the lyrics I could hear being sung/mumbled.

&amp;nbsp;

That is when I found out that, in fact, this is a Coldplay song called ""Clocks.""  Coldplay is another band that I could never get into, so am unfamiliar with their music as well.

&amp;nsbp;

So, let me ask you - is there a Phish song that is similar to this ""Clocks"" song that was played on Top 40/commercial rotation?  Does there in fact exist a Phish song that is similar to this ""Clocks"" song - and that this is the song I am confusing ""Clocks"" with?

I love this band so much.,"Recently, my grandfather passed away and I‚Äôve been dealing with that and the thoughts that come with facing death. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever had to deal with the loss of a loved one in my twenty five years of life, and I consider myself lucky for that. 

His side of the family (paternal, including my father) is rather toxic, and for my own well-being, I typically avoid them when possible.  

I‚Äôm also beginning a new chapter in my life in July when I‚Äôll be moving to Denver from central Illinois. 

To top it all off, I broke up with the girl I‚Äôd been seeing the week prior to his death and one of my closest friends moves away May 9. 

Through it all there has been one constant: music. The ultimate healer, in my opinion. Slogging through the ups and downs of my life has only been bearable with the aid of my favorite artists and their work, and no other collective or individual moves me as much as our beloved Phish. 

For me, no other music evokes the range of emotions than this band encompasses. Joy, aggression, tenderness, hope, frustration, and triumph are all felt in the notes of these four men. 

Being a guitarist of twelve years who has been heavily inspired by Trey‚Äôs interplay between members and the sheer technical skill of his most difficult compositions and improvisation, I am continually awed by the musical feats this group achieves. No band personifies the team spirit of music more so than Phish. 

I feel as if I‚Äôm ranting a little here, but I just wanted to share this because I know others here will identify with it. Through it all there has been Phish. Thank you Trey, Fish, Mike, and Page for everything you‚Äôve done. You‚Äôve inspired someone you‚Äôve never met to strive for greatness each and every day. One day I hope to create music that inspires and moves others the way you have inspired me. 

Thank you as well to this amazing community that has brought me so much joy over the last few years since discovering the band. I‚Äôve gained thousands of friends I never knew I had. 

For whoever is going trough a tough time, celebrating the joys of life, or simply in awe of what music can be, well... this one is for you. ",phish,1524104680,LSGoCards7,10,28,True,2018-04-18

4/20.  What a day for a first show!

My first show was in a little dining hall a few hours drive from my university.  I just hitched along with a bunch of friends who were more familiar with the band.  I had only heard a few tunes off Lawn Boy at the time.  

My buddies dad worked at the University of Rochester and got us ""student tickets"".  I think they were $4.  Maybe $6 at the most.

We walked into the dining hall, with tables pushed against the wall and I positioned myself against the stage.  I saw the whole show from row 1 directly in front of Mike.  It was a great time, although I didn't really know any of the the songs.  I picked up the Junta cassette, which I still have (band published, before Elektra signed them), and really fell in love.

From there it was on to show #2 - Arrowhead Ranch 1991 with the Giant Country Horns!  Wow.

160+ shows later, still loving it!

Underrated / Overlooked Shows or Jams You've Seen In Person,"We all have those shows that we were lucky to be at -- for me, I've been pretty lucky to catch some all-time heater shows: 06/17/04 Brooklyn, 08/05/11 Gorge, 12/29/13 MSG, 10/31/14 Vegas, pretty much all of 2018's NYEMSG run...I've also seen some shite (looking at you, large swaths of Coventry, and 7/22/16 Forum).

For me, the shows I've been to have been the most replayed, partially because some of those jams just never get old (12/29/13's Carini and 08/05/11's RnR &gt; Meatstick &gt; Boogie) but partially because I have a special connection to those jams.

But we're all revisiting the shows that _we_ saw, the ones that have a special place in our hearts because _we were there_, jams that we've listened to often, not just because they're good, but because they evoke those feelings and memories of the show in question.

What are the jams (or entire shows) that you've been to that you feel are underrated or overlooked?

For me:

[06/20/04 SPAC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_gpuZstPk) -- I feel like this show gets overlooked for the previous nights (insane) Piper / Jibboo, but the Waves from S1 and the whole S2 was some of the most insane shit I've ever heard.

[08/15/12 Long Beach - RnR &gt; Ghost &gt; LxL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdoNbQ22zf0) -- I drove down for my Birthday show, cool old small hockey arena in Long Beach, and I remember being a little bummed about the RnR opener for S2, since last year's Gorge RnR was (at the time) my all-time favorite Phish jam ... and then they went and slapped me in the face with the deliciousness.

[08/05/13 Hollywood - The Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mDQ1L523v4). I _hate_ the Hollywood Bowl, but on this night, with this song, it was pretty much perfect.

Let's discuss volume 2: Pebbles and Marbles,"Here's the link to volume 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/phish/comments/8ba9ue/lets_discuss_scents_subtle_sounds

I was planning on doing this in quicker succession, but life sometimes sets up road blocks. However, I found this, https://imgur.com/HYpfC5s, while walking down the road, and it inspired me to get on the ball.

Lyrics: 

She started a blaze from one tiny spark. 
I didn't even detect. 
She loved the light, was dismayed by the dark. 
The stars though she seemed to respect. 

The faint light that flutters at night to the earth. 
Would land in her eyes and collect. 
Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf. 
I never thought to inspect. 

Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind. 
Seem to get lost and harder to find. 
When I am alone I am inclined. 
If I find a pebble in sand. 
To think that it fell from my hand. 

She gave me ideas. 
Planted the seed. 
But she never stopped to reflect. 
The course that she's on, wherever it leads. 
I never would redirect. 

Pebbles and marbles like words from a friend. 
Make us hold tight but are lost in the end. 
When we're alone we all seem to tend
If we find a marble in dust. 
To wish someone left it for us. 

Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind. 

(again, sorry for bad formatting of lyrics, reddit literally will not allow it to be any other way) 

My interpretation:

The actual meaning of these lyrics is very open-ended, and I'm eager to hear all of your thoughts. 

Its a pretty tough song to decode. I feel it was written that way on purpose. Maybe through our discussions, we can help each other connect some dots that will help make more sense of it. 

The first 2 verses speak of a lost love from the narrator's past, describing her personality, and the feelings he had toward her. 

The next 2 verses describe their differences, and the reason that it didn't work out between them:

Verse 3 is the way he lives, he believes that his thoughts and realizations are his and his alone.
 
Verse 4 is her trying to get him to see her way of thinking. I think that she believes that no thoughts are original, and they are all out there in the cosmos. We, as humans, pick up on these frequencies, which end up being conscious thoughts. Basically, everything that crosses your mind is something that has been thought about or considered by someone at some point.

""She gave me ideas. Planted the seed"": She was trying to force her opinion on the matter on to him 

""but she never stopped to reflect"": she didn't consider his opinion

""the course that she's on wherever it leads, I never would redirect"": He was okay with this difference in opinions, and he cared not to change the way she thought. But she was the one that was trying to redirect his beliefs. It ultimately lead to the demise of their relationship. 

Judging by verse 2, he wasn't necessarily innocent in the matter. ""Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf, I never thought to inspect"": He never really considered that her opinion may actually be the right one, and never cared to find out. 

Verse 5 compares ""pebbles and marbles"" (thoughts) to ""words from a friend"". They ""make us hold tight"" but are ultimately inconsequential or ""lost in the end"". People have different opinions and thoughts contrary to their own. Often-times we ""wish/think"" that our thoughts were left specifically for us. Maybe that's the case, maybe it isn't. It's left up to the reader/listener to decide. 


I hope this was all written in a way that is easy to understand, I did my best. I actually learned a bit by really thinking through what each verse could mean. That is why I enjoy doing this. 

Same rules apply: comment with your favorite version, your own interpretation, your favorite memory involving this song, etc. Pretty much anything goes.

It's Ice takes on new meaning today,"I have spent almost 10 days straight in a hospital with electrodes glued to my head in an attempt to determine if I am a candidate for surgery for my epilepsy. 10 days, no seizures therefore no data to conclude if I am a candidate.

In It's Ice he's fighting and begging for some rest from his mirror image which in reality lives within him. This ""double"" took on a new identity to me, that of my epilepsy and now this famous ice ballet has become the theme of my lifelong battle against it.

I check out tomorrow from the hospital, and as I was packing up this afternoon a line from It's Ice echoed in my mind's eye:

üé∂ Defeated now I sulk and squirm 
above the frozen heights
Waiting, calculating 
till he [next] ventures onto the ice. üé∂

Truly great music can be applied and interpreted in multiple different ways; there is no wrong way to interpret it. I've been listening to Phish for over 25 years and I never viewed this song this way until today. I doubt I'll ever see it any other way....

Phish Loving Business Owners Unite: pitching an idea to see if there is any interest in joining a mastermind,"Hey everyone, this post if for the **Phish loving business owners** out there. 

*Mods, this is not meant to be spam, but delete if you see fit.*

I am a member of a small mastermind that meets every other week. We were connected through a private paid community. All 4 of us are running our own business and looking for an accountability group to stay working on our business and not just working in our business.

**Why am I posting here:**

This mastermind I'm in is great. We didn't know each other before, but now we all have this deep honest connection.

During our last meeting everyone was sharing the conferences they play to attend over the next 6 months. Some were for startups, some marketing, some industry specific.

We were curious if anyone else would be attending. 

**This raised an idea:**

If a business mastermind was formed with a phish connection, we could all meet in person and connect at Phish Dicks or some other 3 night run.

Not only would it be a great common interest, it would make our Phish related travel a business trip too ;)

**Note:**

This is not for people who are monetizing the phish fan base. The purpose of a mastermind is to share details of how your business runs to get honest feedback from others. Like a board of advisers. It is ideal the members have different customer bases or such a huge customer base that there is no scarcity.

**Anyone Interested:**

Let me know here or DM if you have any interest. Maybe include some short explanation of the type of business you have. If there is enough interest for one or more groups I'm willing to do a little work to get them up and running. If there is no interest, I understand, but will be disappointed.",phish,1524940924,finnews,16,6,True,2018-04-28

3. No beer will be sold Wednesday night and the concert grounds will be closed. 

4. New security detail. They do NFL games during the year. This alarmed me at first, but apparently the previous company did the same thing and from what I understand they were pretty good. Pretty sure Phish has different guidelines than the NFL.

"Would there be any interest in a ""Phish Show Of The Day"" subreddit?","For a long time of been toying with the idea of listening to and cataloging every Phish show in existence. Obviously a monumental task. I've also thought that it would be a much more rewarding experience if there were other folks listening along and discussing. 

So the idea is that every day a new show would be posted in it's own thread, and everyone could listen through at their leisure, and post thoughts/opinions/observations. This wouldn't be a ""best-of-the-best"" listening experience -- a fall 97 show could be followed by some 1989 dud. The idea would be to slowly work through the entirety of the band's catalog. Participation would obviously be voluntary, so you could join in and take breaks as desired/listen a few days late/whatever, and still be an active participant.

We could start off haphazardly at first, but move on to following anniversary tours, have votes, guest picks, etc. Maybe after a few months this would take on some kind of structure that I haven't even thought of yet. I have no desire to be the sole ""pick-master"" so hopefully we'd ultimately settle on some collaborative or rotating system.

Mike's Izabella Tease in Baker's Dozen Simple,"This [link](https://youtu.be/6qcEzVw3sRk?t=5h17m10s) should fire up the Baker's Dozen Simple from a few seconds before the aforementioned tease (the actual timestamp of the tease is 05:17:17, using the Baker's Dozen Mega Mix video so the masses can enjoy soundboard quality). That Izabella is teased in this jam is not news. Phish.net notes an Izabella tease, but doesn't attribute it to one of the band members. (Trey teases Izabella in the beginning of this jam, probably about 10 minutes earlier.) I sent this Mike tease to the Phish.net guys and got no response, so maybe I'm just late to the party on this revelation, but hot damn, this is probably the coolest tease I've ever heard: While building tension up to one of the highest highs of the Baker's Dozen, with Trey in the throes of a full rock-bliss moment, Cactus reverts back to the Izabella bassline for the final two measures of the chord progression--one last bit of creative tension before the release.

Help me find an old show from random snippets of memory,"It's the offseason, so maybe a little trivia/riddle will pass the time.

I used have a bunch of tapes back in 1994-6ish (tapes of tapes of tapes).  As was the culture at the time, many were mislabeled and combined so the name and date on the tape might mean nothing.

I had a tape that I loved... but it is gone now.  I probably wore it out.  it was definitely from pre-1995... I thought 91-93.  I think it was labeled ""Green Mountain College"" or ""Townsend Family Park"", but I've looked at those in the archives and still haven't found what I'm looking for.  

Two identifying events from the show:

* At the beginning (of the show?  Of the tape?), there was a repeating, increasingly intense feedback loop noise like a twanging spring and someone in the band (Fish?) yelled ""oh My GOD I'M FREAKING **OUT**!!""

* During the opening reggae section of Harry Hood, Fishman started talking to someone in the crowd saying ""That's a great T-shirt.  That one.  You, right there.  Oh god man, that's my favorite T-shirt"", and then before launching into the fast section of the song, he yelled ""For the T-Shirt!""

There may have been a Lizards, a Timber Ho, it's hard to say.  It was a long time ago.  What I have is more nostalgia than actual memory of the show.

Should I go see the Alpharetta show?,"So I am a die hard deadhead, but I am too young to have ever seen Jerry. I'm not really interested in Dead n Co., But it kills me that I will never see a true grateful Dead show. Recently I've really been getting into Phish. I live in Georgia, so I saw they were coming to Alpharetta in August. Since the shows are sold out, the only tickets left are scalped $130 tickets for nosebleeds. I haven't been to many concerts, but I feel like being way up in a balcony would be much worse.  I assume the tickets usually aren't that expensive when they aren't scalped. $130 for a broke-ass college student is pretty steep though. On one hand I really want to go, but on the other I'm wondering if I should just hold out until the next time they come to town. However, holding out scares me, like the band could break up and I could have ended up missing BOTH the Dead and Phish.  What should I do? I could pull the money together definitely, I just don't know if I should hold out til next time or not.

BONUS: If I do go, which night should I go on? Like historically when Phish plays three days in a row, which day does Phish play the best on?

"An Update on Terrapin Ticketing - the secure, frictionless second-hand ticket marketplace","Hey /r/phish --

I posted [a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/phish/comments/75ymqj/im_working_on_building_a_cashortrade_ticketing/) about how we were starting to build a frictionless ticket marketplace similar to CashOrTrade. I wanted to share that we had our first event last weekend and it was a success!

Here's an article I wrote up about it: https://medium.com/terrapinticketing/terrapin-ticketing-provides-columbus-brewgrass-fans-with-an-easy-secure-way-to-buy-and-sell-last-366e885a518a

I wanted to keep the dialogue going with the community and get your all's feedback. The main differences between our initial idea and the actual implementation:

* We are no longer using Ethereum. We made an entire application and deployed it to the Ropsten testnet and realized it was incredibly slow. It would also require us to issue the initial tickets, something almost impossible to do with the way ticket monopolies are setup right now.

* We have rethought the scalping issue and are instead allowing event admins to flag/message/revoke tickets if they feel like they are gouging fans. We are curious about what the effects of providing an incredibly simple and easy to use way for connecting buyers and sellers together to securely exchange tickets will have on 'outside' markets. From our initial event, we didn't see any tickets on Craigslist or Stubhub and only one on CashOrTrade.


Thanks for reading. I'm excited to hear the community's feedback on the project.",phish,1520887548,KayBeSee,6,8,True,2018-03-12

Dick's 2018... Lemme get ya info!,"Hey all - 

I need some easy crowd sourcing on how to get my Dick's on.  Can you make some good suggestions for:

- hotels
- bars / drunk busses that provide travel to and from the venue
- dispensaries to visit
- side day trips to take while there
- anything else that might be of good use to myself and the general populace

A few of my buddies and I will be traveling from Chicago.  I'm somewhere in the 30s for how many shows I've been to. First show was in 99 so I know the Phish scene and how to surrender to the flow, but don't know Denver or the venue.
Also, if you've ever watched any of the ""How to Phish"" videos and learned how to play guitar through them, I made those!  I'm also the guy who had a 'missed connection outside of Mike Gordon show' where I met Mike and we had a glorious bro shake.  

Hopefully I've made a few of you laugh, or learn a guitar tune over the years.  Any help in getting my socks knocked off at Dick's would be nice.  

Thanks!

2 sad Phish dreams in one night!!,"I rarely have any dreams related to Phish, but I had two last night that were rather nightmarish. The first is short: I went on facebook and saw people talking about seeing Phish in October. Then I went on .com and Phish had announced the Baker‚Äôs Dozen 2 fall tour.  I was sad because I‚Äôm gonna be in school all fall. That‚Äôs a selfish reason, but Its okay bc in the dream I just decided to drop out.
The second is longer. I‚Äôll preface by saying I have tickets to BCGA and the forum this summer, but I still have to confirm I can stay with my grandma in SF. 
So the dream starts and I‚Äôm in BCGA rocking out on the floor. Sadly, I was in the furthest back corner, really far from the stage. I realized I was focusing way too much on the people around me, and not enough on the band (this happened to me during 12/31/17 set 1 bc wooks took over my aisle). It‚Äôs at this point I focus on the music and realize they are about 10 minutes into divided sky. I‚Äôve been dying to see divided sky live, so I was really mad at myself. How could I miss the whole first part and the pause?? I had a realization that months had gone by so fast. It felt like I went straight from March to July 24th. I was mad I had missed Tahoe and couldn‚Äôt figure out how I let that happen. But then I realized something much worse: I had forgotten to tell my grandma I was in town and that I needed a place to stay. This is where it turned nightmarish and i felt intense fear. The second set ended after divided, and I moved up to a better spot on the floor, then sat through the encore (can‚Äôt remember what it was) worrying about what I would do afterwards. I hurried out of the venue and into a really shitty and old looking part of SF. I tried to call my grandma and my aunt but got no answer. I looked around and realized i should‚Äôve gone out the other exit (that‚Äôs where downtown was). I go downtown to my friend‚Äôs hotel room. He is staying on the floor of the room, and they tell me there isn‚Äôt any room for 1 more. I go out onto the balcony and call my sister. I ask her what the date is. She is confused but she says ‚Äúit‚Äôs may 25, duh‚Äù. And at that point I am relieved and I say ‚Äúthank god. You gotta help me I‚Äôm stuck in a dream where it‚Äôs July 24th and I have no place to stay in SF. I‚Äôm just a short young white boy and it‚Äôs chilly tonight what do I do‚Äù. The dream ends at this point. The fact that it was cold and I only had a t shirt on must stem from NYE this year and how fucking cold it was after the shows. I had that feeling that I was gonna have to be alone in the cold again. Anyway I‚Äôm excited for summer tour. And I think I‚Äôll call my grandma today to confirm I can stay there.

Phish made me fall in love with music. I made this record in my bedroom and I'd love to share it with you guys.,"Hey r/Phish,

My name is Peter, I'm 27 years old. I fell in love with Phish when I was 14, and listened to them almost exclusively for 6 years. They taught me so much of what I know about music, seeing them live and listening to their recorded music. [I made this record](https://petercrofton.bandcamp.com/album/nautical-operator) a while back, and thought some people here might enjoy it - it's inspired by a number of groups but mainly Porcupine Tree, Phish, Boards of Canada, and Tycho. If you like it, you can download it for free from my Bandcamp, or [stream it on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/509AuxFmEHovRiXMDBrV11). All feedback is welcome and appreciated!

Melodic Origins: Fuego,"I was jamming to island tour at work - 4/4/98 - and during the Harry Hood encore one of Trey's guitar lines sent a shiver through my spine.

"Audiophiles: Did you become an audiophile/collector after discovering Phish, or did being an audiophile/collector bring you upon Phish? Just curious!","As far back as I can remember really beginning to explore where different types of music could take me (towards the end of high school) I always knew of Phish and the Grateful Dead and how iconic they were and the followings they had, and I listened to some of their music here and there through friends but I never went out of my way to listen to it alone.

Around this time I was jumping on all the new interesting music coming out on pitchfork, etc and wound up getting a little deep into EDM. I'd always though electronic music was a little phony, but that was with literally no experience with it other than thinking raver dance parties. I'll say it, EDM is the first music that I liked enough to get my ass out of my house and go to a show. So for my first couple of years it was a gradual evolution of various dubstep/EDM artists to more electrofunk type music like STS9 and Lotus. Around this time I was growing more and more appreciation for string and oragnic music but not necessarily kicking EDM out altogether.

The thing I LOVED about STS9, Lotus and some other EDM acts is that they recorded and put out for download ALL of their live shows. I'd heard of the Dead and Phish doing this but I never realized how cool it actually is. In between all this music listening I kind of still had the Dead and Phish set aside as ""already confirmed great"" so there was not much need for me to go exploring there. (Oh how wrong I was).

At this point I was getting really into string cheese because I love their blend of bluegrass, rock, jam and the EDM can be ok sometimes too. Since Lotus and STS9 are more electro-ish bands, I'd never found a band like this where you can go to multiple of their shows and hear only a few of the same songs, but never in the same way.

At this point I was chasing that high of different set lists and missing songs and around my 30th Cheese show I started feeling like they couldn't keep up with me. No disrespect to the Cheese, they are amazing and will always have a special place in my heart, but some of their musical decisions and mash ups leave me thinking ""hmmm, ok I guess?"".

Around the time of my 30th Cheese show, about half a year earlier my best friend in the world passed away. He was the biggest Phish fan I know. Brought into the scene by amazing people and he continually tried to get me to go with him. I did, several times, and had a great time every time with him. For some reason I just wanted to stay focused on String Cheese, with a few of my other friends. I regret that now.

Anyway, since his passing I made an effort to look into everything he told me to look into and make Phish my #1 and I haven't looked back since. Not only do I love Phish because they are EXTREMELY talented and diverse enough to never leave you bored but now I feel like I get to be with my friend every show I get.

I'm lucky enough to have access to all of Phish's soundboard recordings and just listening to the show's I've been at with him and some I even haven't evoke more emotion in me than I ever though possible by music. I love that I always have something to remind me of the amazing times I have at their shows.

Now I've got Trey Band coming up at the end of April and Georgia and Curveball in August. This band is connected to me in so many ways I never thought would be possible.

Anyway, sorry for babbling on, just wanted to share my story and see if there are any other audiophiles out there that stumbled upon Phish and never looked back.",phish,1522437890,mike689,5,2,True,2018-03-30

Listened through all of '98; here are my thoughts.,"AKA the sequel to [the '97 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/phish/comments/64ac6e/welp_finally_finished_listening_through_all_of_97). This time I decided to jot more notes down about the shows as I go along. I've only been a Phish fan for a couple years, so I'm no expert, but hopefully my observations will be of some kind of use. Anywho, on to the notes.

Island Tour: this condensed tour is a strong 4-night run, and a fan favourite. At this point Trey's tone has changed from what I heard in the '97 recordings and is a bit more heavy/fuzzy I think. The jamming is getting looser as well, and includes more ambient excursions. The 2nd and 3rd nights are my favourite, especially set II of 4/4. 

By the beginning of the Summer European tour, it's clear that Ghost is maturing and changing. It has more distinctive flavours in each performance, rather than only being a vehicle for launching funk jams. Moma Dance goes through some interesting changes too - not only are lyrics and a small 'dance' added to what was originally an instrumental (i.e. Black Eyed Katy), but they are exploring new directions for the vibe of the song and the jamming in it.

Despite what seems to be an increasing number of mistakes in performing the song arrangements, and the presence of several larger fiascos (e.g. the drunken flubs of 7/5, or the sound system issues on 7/10), there are still plenty of great jamming moments in the Euro tour. The 7/6 Ghost and Piper, and 7/9 Tweezer and Drowned offer some intense peaks.

The Summer U.S. Tour certainly has some interesting shows. The setlists include more covers and bustouts than usual. Some are played better than others (The Colonel Forbin-&gt;Mockingbird on 8/7 is somewhat messy for instance, while the Terrapin Station on 8/9 is well played and garners enthusiastic reception from fans). A strong hometown show for Fishman at Vernon Downs wraps up the tour, and it's on to Lemonwheel.

Phish soundchecks can sometimes feel like nice little shows unto themselves. The Lemonwheel soundcheck is certainly no exception, being full of straight up groove and funk. I recommend giving it a listen. The rest of the festival continues the laid-back and fun vibes, and includes great renditions of Moma Dance, Divided Sky, Reba, Gumbo, Tweezer, Ghost, Fluffhead, 2001, and Hood.

Throughout October there are several television appearances. The performances are mostly standard, but there are some unique moments. During Farm Aid, Fishman goes nuts on Moma Dance, and Neil Young joins in for several songs, including a free-form jam after Runaway Jim which leads into a lengthy Down By The River. Full video [is on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUgQ0hGUvqo).  
The Bridge School benefit shows are acoustic sets and feature some beautiful and unique arrangements, for those who like acoustic. Possum, Free Bird, Hood, and Sad Lisa are just some of the songs worth checking out. And maybe it's just me, but Brian and Robert's lyrics about leading a lonely and difficult life seem to take on a new context, given the venue. Trey even turned around to look at the kids on stage before starting the song. Videos are on youtube of both [night 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNdsKDgKkiY) and [night 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FZCtoHDwdY).  
The Sessions at West 54th taping is a more intimate setting, with nice versions of Ghost, Guyute, Driver, and Taste. Full video is [available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAf772Vw3RY)). The show was hosted by David Byrne and there was an interview with the band, [also on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqSWpMT-RVo). 

Much has been said about the Halloween show. The first set has some great type I jams including Sneakin' Sally, CDT, and Weekapaug. The second set is mostly straightforward, with a few songs getting some extra mustard and an interesting jam emerging out of Lonesome Cowboy Bill. The third set is quite strange, with a lot of dark, ambient exploration and Trey infamously walking off the stage during Ghost. The album fillers for the LivePhish release are from the previous night and include a smoothly segued Stash-&gt;Manteca-&gt;Tweezer-&gt;NICU-&gt;Ambient Jam sequence.

The 11/2 show in Utah is also unique and well-known, though for different reasons. The story goes that they decided to do the surprise cover of Pink Floyd's *Dark Side of the Moon* as a treat for the few in attendance and a reminder to everyone else not to miss out-of-the-way shows. The result is probably a stronger 'Halloween costume' show than the more uneven one a few days prior. The band wastes no time getting into serious jamming with the opening Tube-&gt;Drowned-&gt;JJLC. There are other highlights, such as an extended Limb by Limb and a YEM with a lengthy ambient intro. But the album cover is what the show is famous for, and DSOTM is well played, especially considering the fact that they learned it at the last minute.

The November shows are varied in quality. The trend of lengthier ambient excursions continues, but there is also some high energy/'machine gun' playing from time to time. The Hampton shows (aka 'Hampton Comes Alive') don't have a lot of deep jams, but are fun and silly. 11/27 was another official release (as Live Phish 06) and is an excellent show, featuring many 'Wipe Out' teases and jams.

The NYE run at Madison Square Garden is a strong send-off for the year. 12/29 and 12/31 are the best shows of the run to my ears.



Some of my favourite shows of the year:

4/3 - Nassau Coliseum  
4/4 - Providence Civic Center  
7/6 - Lucerna Theatre  
7/17 - Gorge Amphitheatre  
7/28 - Sandstone Amphitheatre

Advice for flying to Curveball,What is the best way to get to the festival when having to fly? Thinking about flying to Ithaca and taking an Uber to the festival (30-45 minutes). Will I be able to get an Uber/Lyft/taxi? ,phish,1522809479,funderCUDI,19,3,True,2018-04-03

Help me make a Spotify playlist for a friend,"A group of friends and I were at dinner the other night, and we got talking about music.  One brought up his love for Animal Collective, saying ""They're sort of the new Grateful Dead, who I also love.""  So of course I asked if he listened to Phish, and he said ""No... should I?""  Oh boy.

We got to talking about the different eras of Phish - the weirdness and exploration of the early/mid 90s, the rise of the funk in 97, the ambient spaciness of 00 and the oxy jams of 2.0.  Those latter two interested him the most, and he asked me to put together a Spotify playlist.

With ambient/drone/noise jams as a base, I put together a short playlist:  https://open.spotify.com/user/68pbvp64dhfhok1qm6iwr29br/playlist/1YTBnGjvvex69PyQtRnyTT

&gt; Fukuoka Jam -&gt; Walk Away -&gt; Fukuoka Jam 2 (quintessential semi-ambient groove, great transitions)

&gt; Alpine Valley WTU (Lovely thick droning sounds)

&gt; Fukuoka Gumbo (Traditional song, coupled with a nice building jam)

&gt; Live One - Harry Hood (outside of the pattern, but it's just so masterful, and shows off some composition too)

&gt; 11/14/95 Dog Faced Boy -&gt; Stash (Spooky and quiet, then builds into a wonderful cacophony)

&gt; Amsterdam - Saw it Again (Another solid song to cleanse the palate, with some nice heavy type 1)

&gt; Amsterdam - Wormtown Jam (Semi-ambient weirdness/humor)

What else should be on there?  He's also a fan of Ween and Primus so he won't shy away from dumb humor or complex progginess, but he made it clear those droning noise jams would attract him the most.  I also wanna avoid anything long and same-y, since that might make a new listener's attention wander... almost skipped the Fukuoka jam for this reason, but I'm sure he'll like it.",phish,1522850329,FiveDozenWhales,12,8,True,2018-04-04

"So Reddit's April Fool's Prank was pretty lame, but let's make it Phishy!","I know my prank was even lamer (Phish gig on April 1st), but Reddit is doing an r/CircleofTrust.  Basically you create a circle, and invite people to join your circle.  They either join or betray.  If you don't betray your flair is blue, if you betray your flair is red.  If no one betrays the circle, it stays open.  As soon as one person betrays a circle it closes.  Let's see how big we can make my circle, Gamehendge.  

Go to this link, comment with something super Phishy that only someone really into Phish would get, and PM me, and I'll send you the password for the circle.  It's really a poorly executed site by Reddit, but it appears that the biggest circle is only a few hundred large.  Let's rock this.  Here is the link to my circle:

Using blockchain to fix the ticket problem,"tldr: Distribute fan tickets and prevent scalping by using a blockchain since the entire distribution and transfers would be public.

Lately I have been playing around with the Ethereum network and was thinking that it could potentially provide secure ticket distribution as well as potentially solve the scalping problem.

Looking around I see that a couple blockchain companies are already doing this (or in blockchain terms ""say that they're doing this"").  Even so I don't see how, or if, they focus on preventing scalping.

It would be super cool to not only securely distribute tickets but also expose the transfers of tickets in the public ledger to detect scalping.  Maybe through some sort of mechanism even trigger the return of the ticket back and redistribute it if it's been flagged as scalped.

Anyhow - I've had a lot of ideas about how something like this could work and am happy that it may eventually happen (maybe by one of us).

The reason that I'm writing this is to enter the idea into our consciousness so that like a blockchain perhaps we can reach a consensus as a community and potentially promote it to manifestation.

Back in the 90's it was a pretty big deal how the Phish community put together a news group around the band then eventually some web sites.  It would follow suit if somehow we could fix ticketing too.

I love seeing Phish but get damn tired of how bad the scalpers and secondary markets take an advantage of us.

So should we start a new Github repo and ...

Let's each make a point to donate to Volunteers In Medicine in memory of Dr. McConnell!,"You've ""spent"" all that money on ticket requests, it's time to give back!  Karma, baby...

Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) began in Hilton Head, South Carolina. In the early 90s, one out of three people who lived on Hilton Head Island had no access to health care, a rate twice the national average. At the same time, retired medical personnel including physicians, nurses, dentists, expressed an interest in finding a way to continue practicing their profession on a voluntary, part-time basis to help those without access to medical care.

In 1994, under the leadership of founder Dr. Jack McConnell, these two groups were brought together to open the first Volunteers in Medicine Clinic.  Word spread nationally about the success of the Hilton Head VIM clinic.  In response to requests for assistance in replicating the VIM model, Dr. McConnell created a separate nonprofit to assist interested communities in launching their own Volunteers in Medicine clinic.

Unfortunately, my crew seems unable to join, and we couldn't get a sitter. Therefore, I may well be rolling to the Gorge alone with seven extra 3-day passes available.

Opinion on Cash or Trade,"This is completely anecdotal, but I think Cash or Trade is too overpopulated and established to be a friendlier alternative to the second-hand market for folks new to the service.

Advising a /r/phish user to go there is basically pointless. There are far too many members that have 100 5 star reviews for a seller to give any one new on that site the time of day. 

I've been through this now with NYE and currently with this tour. I have Gold, Have alerts, and respond quickly. I get no response, because I have no reviews. Why should I be trusted when CustymcGee just messaged the same seller and has 100 5 star reviews from previous transactions?

Stubhub and their competitors all suck, and buying and selling at face is commendable, but the barrier to entry at Cash or Trade is too large. Telling people here to go there isn't really helpful anymore.

Having the reps search for the bet seats over and over and over and over. they were all working together and making them hold seats while another searched for more tickets or some shit. 

Anyways, the scumbos Buy their tickets and head to the car, and it turns out they locked themselves out of their car. So there‚Äôs some good karma.

A significant number of articles actually point to ""fan presales"" as a huge part of the secondary market (along with bots, credit card companies, and a large proportion being the artists themselves) with a majority going to the re-sellers/bots. 
And as a personal aside, I was almost never shut out of mail order tickets when it was attached to the paper newsletter, and we're still talking about 30K+ venues at the time; yet, since it's been this online system, odds are so low there's almost no point.

Phish.in Jamcharts Playlists 1997-2017,"Hey Guys,

&amp;nbsp;

This is my first reddit post so hopefully this is how you do it...

&amp;nbsp;

I was getting frustrated on the phish.in site that you could not just play the jamcharts songs straight through.  Every time you would click on one to play in the tagged section it would queue up that whole show instead of just going down the list.

&amp;nbsp;

So...I decided to make my own playlists containing all of the songs tagged with jamcharts by year.  If you click the links below I think it should take you right to them and you can bookmark them for yourselves.  There are 100 song limits on the playlists so some of the deeper years are multi-part, and I did cut some verisons and added some others that I personally like.  It's been fun just hitting a year and throwing it on shuffle, enjoy!

Cannabis strains and Phish shows,"While I‚Äôve enjoyed many a Phish show completely sober, these days I like to drink a couple beers and smoke a little weed when I go. I don‚Äôt smoke very often (pretty much only when I go to shows) and find the menu at my local dispensary completely overwhelming. It‚Äôs like the Cheesecake Factory - there‚Äôs just so many choices. I know I like Sativas or Sativa-dominant hybrids, but I was looking for some advice on what strains people recommend for Phish shows. Ideally, it would be energizing and euphoric with minimal paranoia. I‚Äôm not looking to lose my mind, just heighten the experience a bit. ",phish,1518626645,CatFacedBoy,57,13,True,2018-02-14

We have 2 Terrace spots (fk yeah!), but not all of us can arrive at the same time - most coming on Thursday, but a couple showing up Friday. 

Question - how strict are they about making EVERYONE show up at the same time for camping check-in? Can we do something like provide the straggler's names or collect their wristbands early? Can we grease some palms?

Anyone want to listen to the live releases on Spotify in chronological order and discuss?,"To prepare for the summer tour, I am listening to all of the live releases on Spotify in chronological order, starting with Colorado ‚Äò88.

Decided to make this post half way through the second set of 2/20/93, so currently on At the Roxy (Atlanta ‚Äò93).  Happy to start the discussion from Colorado ‚Äò88. 

Background - 

I grew up with classic rock, playing guitar, and starting to explore jammish bands in high school. Came across phish at the start of college and saw my first show at Bethel Woods on 5/27/11. Saw them once or twice a year, including 2015 and 2016 NYE, until this past summer. Baker‚Äôs Dozen dunked me in the deep end and it‚Äôs been just a delightful 6 months since. Loving the music and the community more than ever. Was at 4 shows at BD (strawberry, jam filled, cinnamon, and lemon nights), and the first two nights of the NYE run. Happy to discuss those too. 

I‚Äôve been listening to as much as possible. My favorite era is all of 97 (listened to fail 97 from start to NYE), and early 2000. Don‚Äôt know the pre-94 era, 2.0, or first half of 3.0 that well.",phish,1518839185,smilingbuddha71,26,2,True,2018-02-16

"Every live Phish song, visualized based on their audio features","I saw another post about phish data visualized, and I had been debating whether or not to post what I found from my own personal stuff (This data will be used to feed a live phish radio feature on my hose app that I created). That post inspired me to actually post this, in case any nerds out there like looking at this kind of thing 


I just spent the last couple of weeks running every single phish song performance ever played through an audio analysis tool, and then visualized some of the results. I clustered the songs based on how similar their audio attributes were, and these were my results. The 7 different ""groups"" represent each cluster.

I found some interesting data here (this was mostly a proof of concept to see if the first step of our algorithm would work). For example if you look close enough (I know there's a ton of shit in there), you can see many of the acapella performances end up in one cluster with each other (Sweet adeline, i didnt know, carolina, etc etc etc).

Here's a link to the 5 images I created from the data. Sorry it's kinda hard to read, but maybe you can find some interesting stuff in there https://imgur.com/a/uh41C

David Welker: The Maze Poster Release,"Heads up Phriends:  David Welker is dropping his Maze print tomorrow (Wednesday 2/21) at noon:  [The Maze](https://welker-studios.myshopify.com/)

Here is the text from the email:

A little over 25 years ago I had the great pleasure of working with the band Phish on their concept album titled ""Rift"". It was a rare chance to work intimately with these four legendary musicians when they were still getting fan mail in a shoe box. When it was proposed that there would be this main character lying diagonally in a bed I was struck with the literalness of it. So straight away I put myself headlong into it. I was the guy lying diagonally in the bed doing my best impression of Martin Sheen's post Saigon meltdown in Apocalypse Now. And fittingly I was in the midst of a breakup during the whole creative process.

This album spoke to me in so many ways over the years and I just couldn't help but feel there was some strange almost mystical connection going on. I'm sure I'm not alone though. So, now I find myself revisiting this room, this strange house, and wondering what it would look like if the Maze came to life. What would it feel like to still be inside the Maze 25 years later? The woman is in the doorway. Is she staying or is she leaving? It was the story of my life for a while. Perhaps the man finally chooses love and is released from the Maze. At this moment the man in the bed appears like a sort of Rip Van Winkle character rowing a boat diagonally across the sheets which have now turned to a rushing torrent of water. If the morning ever comes the album would seem to suggest that love prevails. So there is a lot of dynamic tension in this piece but all the while there is serenity in the face of the man and calm in the woman. And peace in the distance.

I began this drawing process 11 months ago and I feel like I lived another micro lifetime again as the main character letting the piece tell me what it wanted to become. It's as much the story of my life as it is the continuing story of the song and countless other souls who have journeyed with this band and their amazing legacy.

[Theory] Trey's Languedoc guitar is named Jimmy Page,"This theory has been developed around several clues which Trey has been dropping since Halloween 1994 revolving around the Beatles song, [Glass onion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH2BEStWmPI). Below is a quote from the phish.net entry on Glass Onion: 

&gt;With an altered lyric and an alternate implication, Phish covered the third tune on The Beatles‚Äô White Album on Halloween 1994. Rather than remind us of ‚ÄúThe Fool on the Hill,‚Äù Trey chose to inform us: ‚ÄúI told you ‚Äòbout Guyute the pig ‚Äì I tell you man he‚Äôs dancin‚Äô a jig!‚Äù Additionally, the Walrus apparently wasn‚Äôt a McCartney ‚Äì he was a Languedoc, as Trey so indicated by pointing back to the soundboard at the appropriate time.

Trey makes it clear that in this case that the Paul he's referring to in the line ""The walrus was Paul"" was not Paul McCartney but Paul Languedoc, the builder of his guitar. This is the first of three instances some iteration of this phrase was spoken by Trey. 

The second instance came twenty(one) years later at Dicks 2015, inside of Harpua. Trey says, ""Here's a little hint for you... The walrus was Page!"" Now one would assume that the Page in question is the chairman of the boards himself, but the next occurrence of the line adds a new meaning. 

&gt;Jimmy holds the Tannis root. The forest‚Äôs tasty nectar shoot.  The sun tips off the monarch‚Äôs suit, from sequined sash to shiny boot‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs another clue for you all: the monarch was Wilson! Here‚Äôs another clue for you all: the walrus was Jimmy!

This was said on the Jimmie night of the Bakers Dozen, during Fly Famous Mockingbird. So now when we look at each reference to Glass Onion, we get that the walrus was simultaneously Paul Languedoc, Page, and Jimmy. How could that be possible, unless all three are referencing the same thing. The Walrus is Jimmy Page, and Jimmy Page is the Languedoc, and the Languedoc is the Walrus. 

TL;DR: Trey has been leaving clues in the Beatles Glass Onion about the name of his guitar, probably. Maybe. ",phish,1519169522,confetti27,9,3,True,2018-02-20
Looking to memorialize 12/31/16 and 12/31/17 with PTBM Stubs,"Hey friends.

2016 was my first NYE experience. In 2017 I managed to bring the lady into the fold - and she totally bought in. The only thing I have to memorialize either year is a TM printout, which just feels hollow. I really miss the days where printouts just weren't actually a thing.

It would just be really nice to lay my hands on a PTBM stub for either:

- 2017 to memorialize the wonderful womans first SHOW ever

ISO: Sessions at West 54th outtakes? (preferably lossless),"Phriends! 

Back around 1999 or so, I bought a bootleg CD-R of the entire Sessions at West 54th show. The performance was killer and it was one of my early favorite shows (having gotten into the band in 98). 

Of course, it's been years and moves across states since I last recall physical possession of the CD and I got the jones to listen tonight. I fired up my iTunes and was crushed to learn the rip I made is unlistenable....constant interference that sounds like bad tracking of a DAT.

I checked a popular torrenting site to see if it was posted there, but no go. Thusly, I am reaching out to this fine group. Anyone happen to have a link or dl to a (preferably lossless) copy?

Thanks!

Mildly Interesting Post-Script: I remember purchasing the disc from a place called ""Disc Go Round"" in Chicago. Just south of Clark and Belmont. They must have made a fortune from bootlegs, as they were one of the first places I ever saw a CD burner. They would go to other stores (Reckless, Dr. Wax) and buy one bootleg title and then they would make their own boots of the boots. I remember the cover of the Sessions at West 54th was terrible jet printer paper. It sounded awesome, though!

Edit: Seems like the consensus is broad and largely experience based. Guess I know my next show plus one. ",phish,1519835346,way2bored,19,2,True,2018-02-28

12/28 No mans&gt;twist,"I've listened to this past New Years run a few times through now. The whole second set from 12/28 is altogether amazing, but the no man in no mans land&gt; twist is simply spectacular. They really hit their stride in no mans with some great leads taken by all of them at some point. Then they get into a twist that for about a 5-6 minute portion peaks as some of my favorite 3.0 jamming. The rest of the set doesn't disappoint either. Just haven't seen much love for this jam and thought it deserved some recognition ",phish,1515281570,kylechad,33,26,True,2018-01-06

What I love about Phish.,"So I'm finally watching my stream of the New Year's show, watching Trey jump up and down as he belts out Fuego and was thinking...  You know how music is like the *purest* form of communication, and Phish are up there literally blasting out their feelings over amplifiers, and it's such a strong sensation that you (the audience) can't help but empathize with them and share in their feelings?  And what Phish is feeling is how fucking psyched they are to be here?  Man, that's the best feeling.

EDIT: Not to mention the fact that they're also getting pummeled by our good vibes, and it creates a feedback loop of love and light.",phish,1515299805,lintrone,4,17,True,2018-01-06

Timeline/history of the current jam scene,"Since getting into phish about half a decade ago, I've become pretty familiar with a lot of other bands in the jam scene, and something that I've always been curious about, and don't really know much on, is a general timeline of the evolution of the scene.

I'm talking like, which bands gained popularity and/or peaked around what years, etc.

For example it is my understanding that phish got a big influx of fans when Jerry passed, which propelled them to the top of the scene, and during both of Phish's subsequent breaks, other jam bands gained significant fans. Was it all at once? Where are some of these bands on their current trajectory? They've all faced bumps and changes- I know Cheese has changed their sound a lot and added members, and Bisco changed their drummer in the early 2000's. How were these changes taken by their fans? It seems like some bands like Cheese, Umph, and moe. have all seen much better days as far as crowds, but Umph is still going pretty strong whereas Cheese seems to be slowing down. Were bands like Lotus ever ""big"" or did they just kind of slide into the mid tier over time? I guess if you know a lot about any of these specific bands, a little perspective is much appreciated, because at this point I'm mostly familiar with all of their music, but not their history.",phish,1515640352,Memescroller,40,3,True,2018-01-10

"Just getting into Phish, album recommendations?","I've been a deadhead my whole life and jam-band fan for a long time. I've always been a little turned off by the ""goofy-ness""  of a lot of phish songs but I recently listened to a mid-90s show for the first time and I have to say, I'm hooked and I can definitely get over my initial aversion to their lyrical style. Not everyone can have Hunter writing for them, and that's okay. 

With the dead, I liked the way that I fell in love with their studio work then was blown away hearing the songs I adore stretched into a 20 minute musical improv soup. I'd like to experience Phish in the same way(unless y'all think its completely unnecessary) and was wondering in y'all had any favorite studio work that I can familiarize myself with before diving into the rabbit hole of live shows. 

Also, are there any ""definitive"" smokin or special live shows that I should check out once I'm ready? Thanks. 


EDIT: seriously, thanks guys. You've officially got me converted. If you've got anything else, keep it coming, but I appreciate the guidance. This band has a whole lot more diversity and complexity than i ever gave them credit for.

The 2017 New Year's Run soundboards are the best sounding LivePhish recordings ever,"I've been a livephish+ subscriber since 2015, and listened to pretty much every show on Livephish.

At any given moment I can completely lock into any of the four instruments or the vocals and isolate them from the rest. Mike pops more than ever.

2015 recordings were awful. 2016 and 2017 have been steadily improving. Dick's this year, Mike was turned way up to where he always should have been, but they completely refined it at NYE and achieved perfect balance.

My funny? Phish story,"I know we probably see too many of these posts on here, and I've shared a few in the past. But thinking about Watkins Glen this summer reminded me of a funny? story that happened to me at Magnaball. 

I did much of the Summer 2015 tour solo, and found it to be a refreshing and cathartic experience. I roll into Magnaball healthy, happy, and ready to get down. I decide to eat some paper on night 2, and had a blast, although I probably did a little too much for a 40-something year old. I go back to my campsite (Glen Close) after the Drive-in set, and am waiting for my new friends to arrive so we can commiserate about what the hell just happened. 

I had been sitting for a bit, when some spun dude walks into my camp, and sits down. He starts straight in asking me where my drugs are. I politely tell him that I have none. He then asks me where my money is. I tell him I don't have any. Keep in mind that I'm barely holding it together as it is, and some dude is trying to fuck with me or even worse, rob me. I decide that he's just wasted, and I should get him out of my campsite. I'm in no condition to fight him, so I tell him ""I know where we can find drugs and money right now, follow me."" My intention was to walk him to the camp gate then disappear into the crowd around the tunnel. Here's where it gets weird...

As we're walking he slides behind me, and starts talking to himself, saying stuff like ""I can't believe I'm gonna have to stab this guy. Why won't he just do what I'm telling him to do? I'm gonna cut his fucking throat"" I pick up the pace, and as we get to the secure gate for Glen Close camping, I get behind him, push him out into the crowd past the security guards, and yell ""He doesn't belong here! Imposter!"" as I turn tail, and run as fast as I could back to my camp. 

When I get to the camp, my neighbors have arrived, and I tell them the story. In my altered state, I could sense that they're calling BS on me. So I sulked into my tent for the night. This would be a good time to end the story, but no...

The next morning, I wake up to a weird feeling in my face. I exit the tent and my new friend actually gasped at my appearance. He said ""holy shit, dude! Your face is fucked!"". My left eye was completely swollen shut, super puffy. I put ice on it, and it kept getting worse. Apparently, I was bitten by a spider (or something) in my tent. At this point, I had to make the decision to call it a weekend, and drive the 7 hours back home. I'm bummed to miss night three, but didn't want to risk it getting worse. 

So I'm leaving the festival, headed to the highway, and there is a State Police blockade stopping every car, and searching a few. I'm fucked, I just know it. I start sweating, the acid is kicking back in a little, and I'm obsessing about how I look like Rocky Dennis leaving a Phish show. The trooper comes up to my car, takes one look at me, and says ""What the hell happened to you, man?"" I told him I thought I was bit by a spider. He just nods, and I wait to be told to pull over and searched. He keeps nodding, and I ask him, ""sir, what do you want me to do?"" He asks me to pull over, and I see my freedom slipping away. He calls some of his buddies over, they each take a turn leaning in the car to look at my face. Then they all laugh and one says, ""man, I think you've had enough this weekend. Safe travels"". 

tl;dr: Was almost murdered at my campsite, got bit by a critter, and laughed at by cops. Best show ever! No superpowers...

EDIT: OK, not ""funny"", but ""weird, strange, disconcerting, abnormal"". Dude was definitely having an issue/episode. I'm sure someone took care of him, it's Phish. Geez, y'all can be so damn serious...",phish,1516655444,Rippdaniell,9,11,True,2018-01-22

What west itinerary would you choose?,"The past few summers we have used Phish to determine our summer traveling destinations. Once again, I hope to pack up the family, catch a few shows, and explore some the US we have not been to (for reference, we have two teenage boys 14 and 17 who have now been to their fare share of Phish shows). Last summer we had an amazing time in NYC, and this year we are looking at going west. I've narrowed it down to two possibilities...

1. Fly into San Fran on 7/13, explore northern cali for a few days, then zip over to Lake Tahoe and catch the two shows on 7/17 and 7/18 and then venture down to Yosemite to close things out before returning on the 22nd. 

2. Fly into Denver on 7/13. Hang out there for a day or so and then drive up to Bozeman/Yellowstone/etc.. for four or five days before zipping over to to Washington to catch a couple of the Gorge shows before departing from Seattle on 7/22. Definately more drive time on this one. 

Either national park is bucket list stuff for me, so that part is almost a draw. I was leaning more towards Tahoe, but that parking lot venue sort of brought back flashbacks of sitting on the metal flooring in the baking heat at Wrigley two hours before that show.

Hope to do Dick's one day, but the kiddo's are back in school by that point (even if it is a holiday weekend) and everything would seem a bit rushed. If I do that it would most likely be solo. ",phish,1516900783,wareagle1972,9,2,True,2018-01-25

Summer Predicament,"So for some context, I'm a 21 year old student who lives in NC. For a while now, I had been planning on spending the summer in Colorado and joining a conservation corps.

Summer tour announcement has made me second guess that plan though. Living in NC, I'd be close enough to go to a decent amount of shows.

Trey's close friend Chris Cottrell passed away from cancer,"Link to FB Post:

https://www.facebook.com/treyanastasio/posts/10154506555242168


For the smart people without Facebook:

My lifelong friend Chris Cottrell died tonight from adrenal cancer. My heart is truly broken. 
He leaves two beautiful daughters, Ayla and Kiara, his loving wife Amanda, and two brothers, Hamm and Trow. 

Chris was a deeply caring father, husband and friend, and at the same time, Chris was a true badass, as tough as nails on the outside, while Inside he had the biggest heart of anyone I‚Äôve ever known. Chris and I were like blood brothers from the age of 15. Chris was always the first friend who would call when times were hard, he always knew exactly what to say, and more importantly, what not to say. He was also hilarious, and right up until his last day was cracking all of us up, including his nurses, who all loved him. He died surrounded by his loved ones in the comfort of his home. 

Chris was a wicked skier, and In the early 90s the four of us in Phish even sponsored him when he competed in the extreme skiing competition. He planned on skiing the competition in Fish‚Äôs dress, naked underneath, with the dress flapping up in the air as he went down the mountain. That didn‚Äôt actually end up happening, but we all had a good laugh picturing it, and he did well in the competition that year, despite wearing regular ski clothes. Chris loved elk and deer hunting in Colorado, and especially loved spending long hours above the tree line, he loved being up in the mountains. He also loved surfing, and he and Amanda loved spending time in Costa Rica, surfing, and being by the ocean.

When our kids were all little, Chris took our families on 3 day rafting and camping trips out west. We‚Äôd go kayaking, and he was also an expert fly fisherman. He would take me fishing and I would never catch anything...while Chris would end up with 12 fish. It was like he could sense where they were hiding behind the rocks- he was in tune. 

Chris‚Äôs fingerprints can be found on the world of Phish and TAB. If you look in the liner notes of the live TAB album ‚ÄúPlasma‚Äù you‚Äôll see that Chris was a co producer, helping me pick which tracks would make the cut. The song ‚ÄúPush on till the day‚Äù is packed with references to our countless adventures together. It begins with the line ‚ÄúC Cott is a friend of mine‚Äù, and among other things it includes a reference to ‚ÄúThe Back of the Worm‚Äù which was heard at a Phish show at the Paradiso in Amsterdam in 97 but actually came from the night before that, when Chris and I were wandering aimlessly thru the dark streets of Amsterdam at 3am, completely lost and cracking up, when we both suddenly stopped in our tracks and realized at exactly the same moment that there were giant 100 foot long sand worms swimming just below the surface of the water in the canals right next to us. It was a horrifying thing to realize, but there was nothing we could do...the worms were there, and that was the end of it. So I looked sheepishly at Chris and sort of mumbled, ‚ÄúI think you know where you are....‚Äù and he replied, ‚Äú.....you‚Äôre on the back of the worm‚Äù...which started us off laughing, whispering back and forth as we walked quickly away, ‚ÄúI think you know where you are...you‚Äôre on the back of the worm!‚Äù the chant continued all night and into the next day...right up onto the stage the next night. 

Stuff like that used to happen all the time with Chris. He lived in Boulder in the 80s and early 90s, and whenever Phish would come to town, which was quite a lot, we had a ritual where we would circumnavigate the entire city of Boulder, walking for hours at night, just talking and laughing. 

Chris and I both loved Jimi Hendrix so much...and we would always crank Band of Gypsies or Red House or some other Jimi track on the stereo when we were together, really loud, standing in front of the speakers together, and Chris, (whose nickname for me as ‚Äústain‚Äù, because my last name is Anastasio, which morphed into ‚ÄúAin Stain‚Äù, which morphed into ‚Äústainus on the ainus‚Äù, and then into simply ‚Äústain‚Äù).. would lean into my face while Jimi ripped, at ear bleeding volume, and he would yell.... ‚Äústain!!! Listen to that sustain!‚Äù 
Meaning... not just sustain of one note, but the way Jimi always kept the energy flowing like a torrent...like whitewater rafting, how he would sustain, a roaring rapid of sustain. So when I walked onstage at the countless shows where Chris would be hanging backstage, he would always say to me, just as I walked out, ‚ÄúStain!..... sustaaaiiiin!‚Äù 

Even when he couldn‚Äôt be at the show I‚Äôd often call or text him before the show and say,
‚ÄúCo-taage! (My nickname for him.. taaage is pronounced ‚Äútaj‚Äù like in Taj Mahal) I‚Äôm gonna sustaaiiin!‚Äù 

And he‚Äôd say something like ‚Äúwell done, grasshopper‚Äù 

If you are ever in Crested Butte, there are many gorgeous homes in that town that Chris built. He had his own construction company, and built beautiful luxury homes, including his own, which was breathtaking, and always spotlessly clean. 
For the last decade of his life Chris was a grower in California. He loved and cared for his plants like a doting father, like they were his babies, watering and spraying for hours and hours every evening and early morning, building solar powered watering systems, or special air transfers and lighting systems for the indoor grow, dealing with pests, weather changes etc...He always took enormous pride in everything he did, and it showed...and of course he was a caring, loving expert as a grower too. 
Mostly, Chris loved Amanda, deeply and unconditionally. They had a rare and beautiful relationship. He was unwavering in his love for her, and she for him. It was such a heartwarming thing to witness. When he got sick, all he ever talked to me about, other than how proud he was of his beautiful daughters, was Amanda, and how he wished she did not have to go thru this. 
This post is way too long, so forgive me, but I guess I don‚Äôt care...because I‚Äôm so heartbroken, and I just want to share one more memory, if you will indulge me.

Sometime in the mid 90s Mike was driving up the highway when he picked up the actor Courtney Gaines hitchhiking. Courtney was well known for playing the character of Malachi in Children of The Corn, with his wild red hair, he was the one who hacked everybody up.

Mike started to contemplate a crazy gag, and at band practice and the gag came into focus..
So the next time we played in Vegas, we rented a giant suite with a balcony and a piano, and we invited tons of friends to a huge party in the room‚Ä¶Mike even hired two opera singers... 
The gag was this‚Ä¶Courtney and I bought the exact same clothes, because with my long red hair at the time, Courtney and I looked similar... we each bought an identical bright blue blazer, pants and shoes. Chris was chosen to be the target of the gag, because this was going to be so scary that we needed a person who wouldn‚Äôt have a heart attack when it happened, and Chris was literally the only person we could think of who would be able to withstand it.

After taking some mushrooms just to add to the fun, I took Chris out gambling for a couple of hours while the party raged on in the room. Chris of course had no idea that Courtney was there...I was supposed to bring him back at exactly 2:45 am, which I did...When Chris and I got back to the room, everyone had left and we were alone, even though secretly they were all hiding up on the balcony looking down at us. There was a large screen TV placed in front of the couch and Children of the Corn was playing on the TV. Chris and I sat down on the couch...it was very dark in the room, except for the light from the TV, and just as we sat down, Courtney begin hacking furiously...with that weird curved blade thing and horror music blaring...at that moment I excused myself to go to the bathroom, Courtney and I switched in the bathroom, and Courtney returned to my seat on the couch dressed in the exact same clothes I‚Äôd been wearing, wearing my glasses, with his shaggy red hair, and sat right down next to Chris...the whole party and the opera singers, (who were instructed to scream at the top of their lungs at the exact moment that Chris screamed) were watching from above.
Adding to the weirdness was the fact that Courtney is a professional actor, so he sat down next to Chris on the couch and then turned and made eye contact with him, with a horribly scary ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kill you‚Äù face that i could see from the bathroom, and was so scary that even I was scared...this was only moments after I had been sitting next to Chris in the exact same spot...and meanwhile in the background, ‚Äúmovie Courtney‚Äù was hacking up a storm, with the movie cued to the exact worst spot.

Chris stood up and started slowly backing away in terror and confusion...trying to get a handle on what was happening...at which point I sort of panicked because I felt worried that it was just all too much, so I ran out, thinking I‚Äôd make it would easier for him, but in reality, that‚Äôs when he really lost it because now there were two of me, in the dark, dressed identically, but one was Malaki.
Anyway, my favorite part of this whole story is that by the next night Courtney and Chris had become pals, and while we were playing the show I kept seeing the two of them running around drinking and partying together (it was the Primus Halloween Harpua show), and that says more about Chris than anything. He loved the whole thing.

AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM TREY

Last Friday night, I got together with Mike, Page and Fish to talk openly about the strong feelings I've been having that Phish has run its course and that we should end it now while it's still on a high note. Once we started talking, it quickly became apparent that the other guys' feelings, while not all the same as mine, were similar in many ways -- most importantly, that we all love and respect Phish and the Phish audience far too much to stand by and allow it to drag on beyond the point of vibrancy and health. We don't want to become caricatures of ourselves, or worse yet, a nostalgia act. By the end of the meeting, we realized that after almost twenty-one years together we were faced with the opportunity to graciously step away in unison, as a group, united in our friendship and our feelings of gratitude.

So Coventry will be the final Phish show. We are proud and thrilled that it will be in our home state of Vermont. We're also excited for the June and August shows, our last tour together. For the sake of clarity, I should say that this is not like the hiatus, which was our last attempt to revitalize ourselves. We're done. It's been an amazing and incredible journey. We thank you all for the love and support that you've shown us.

"Driving cross country (NYC -&gt; The Gorge)..I've just started formulating the route for the drive, but I wanted to reach out to you phine phish pholk: what are your recommendations for ""MUST SEE"" points/places/things/events/anything-at-all along the way?","As the title states, I'm driving out to the gorge this summer to see the Phish from Vermont. The first show of the Gorge run will be my 30th phish show, which adds to the excitement for this journey. 


Everyone and their uncle has been posting about the Gorge over the past week or two, asking the same questions (flights/bus to quincy/rent a car/can someone post a tutorial on how to do the gorge phish), but I want to assure you I am not following along on that trend of naivety. 


Instead, I wish to ask you all something not exactly related to the gorge; something related only in the context of a cross country automobile trek: i'm driving from new york to the gorge. What are your must-see-before-you-die points of interest/destinations between new york city and Quincy, Washington? I'm asking for the radio city ghosts, the tahoe tweezers, the went gins, the big cypress sands of United States of America cross-country travel--the big kahuna spots that will enthrall my senses like a rave with a fondue
stand and strum my heartstrings like a virtuoso harpist. 


---



The route thus far is not at all defined, I just know as of this moment that id love to visit:

-chicago

-Whitefish Lake

-Mount Rushmore (and maybe some other manmade American ""wonders"" or whatever they call em?) 

-Seattle (yes, technically further West than the Gorge, but I will have to pick up a buddy from the airport)

-Colorado (Rocky Mountain National Park maybe, and a city too)

-Arches National Park, Utah


---

^^ this is what ive got so far. In reality, theres no way ill be able to hit every spot I take note of, but Id prefer to have a ton of ideas to narrow down my choices from. 


If you have any suggestions for things to see and places to go in any of the above mentioned spots (chicago, seattle, colorado especially--big places, im gonna need spme guidance lol), please let me know! 


Well, anyway...sorry for the extra long rambling post. that is one of my specialities. Thank you for taking the time to read this far into the post, you have admirable stamina.

Reba 12-31-93,"Wow. I'm much more of a GD fan than a phish fan, and to be honest, I've only mildly enjoyed the (3.0)phish shows I've been to.

But this version of Reba, starting at 5 minutes in, is probably my favorite piece of music across all genres...classical, jazz, rock, blues, Bluegrass, etc. it's really that good to me and I've listened to it countless times. Wow. I thought 12/29/2016 hood was great, but this Reba just blows it out of the water.  

I wonder if fans appreciate exactly how gifted these guys are or if they interpret the music on a less analytical level. That's fine and all, but like, do you guys know what you have here? Holy shit, man. Born under different circumstances, Trey might have been a famous classical composer. It seems like a waste to get too high/drunk before a show just in case the boys are feeling ambitious and whip out one of these bad boys. They don't do it nearly as often anymore, but damn, with what's at stake, I won't be taking any chances. ",phish,1517632628,h-hood96,16,0,True,2018-02-02

Show Rating Spreadsheet,"Hey everyone. I've been relistening to BD and other shows I've been to and been rating them on iTunes by each song. I decided in an hour of boredom to make a spreadsheet to compile all the scores and I'll still be updating this as I go. I did each rating based on its musicality, placement/flow in the show, overall execution (in terms of the composed parts of songs). Obviously some of the rating may seem higher (either by attendance bias or personal preference) than its respective rating on .net but as this allows rating by song I feel that it gives a better idea of the overall rating of the show as opposed to an overall rating as with .net (not to say this is a better way at all but I thought it helps with the ability to not give half stars and whatnot) Thought some fellow stat nerds would like to take a look.

West Coasters - First tell me how crazy I am. Second give me some advice. Please and thank you! :-),"So...  I've been in FL for a long time.  First show Orlando 10-22-94.  Tough being a phan and seeing shows from this home base.  Anyway, the thing is, I've been through some serious s*** over these past few years and I owe myself something special.  So this summer I'm saying f*** it.  I'm hitting some west coast shows for the first time.  Furthest west I've ever been for Phish was Alpine Valley back in June 2009.  

As it stands right now, I'm doing this entirely solo.  I entered the lottery for Tahoe, Gorge, and ATL.

Yesterday I put down my non-refundable deposit on a big Cruise America 28' RV (the large size).  I'm picking it up in Vegas the day before Tahoe and driving over.  I'm then driving to the Gorge for all three nights.  I'm dropping off the RV in Seattle (got a one-way rental) the day after the Gorge and flying back to FL.  Taking care of some business, then I'm hitting up three nights of ATL (I'll have dozens of friends at that show).  

I'm crazy for doing this solo and dropping so much money but I don't care.  What I need is advice from those of you who have been to Tahoe/Gorge.  

1.  8500 capacity at Tahoe?  Will tix be easy or impossible (assuming I'm shut out of the lottery as is tradition)?    

2.  Gorge doesn't sell out, right?  No special concerns for RV - just show up and groove, right?

3.  Where the hell do I camp/park for Tahoe?  Any recommendations?  Can I park the RV there at Harvey's for the show and drive in/out?  Should I find a campsite and Uber in?  I'm clueless here.

4.  I lived and worked all over the forests of Northern CA as a field biologist back in the early 90s but haven't been back since.  Any problems you foresee driving from Tahoe up to The Gorge?  I'm figuring on possibly spending the night in Bend and driving the rest of the way to George on day of show.  Make sense to you?

5.  ANY recommendations on RV campsites, restaurants, attractions I have to hit on this trek from Vegas&gt;Tahoe&gt;George please let me know.

6.  When are holds expected to be seen on CCs?

This is my favorite thing about the Phish Phamily.,"So last weekend was pretty lonely, I was sitting in the house all weekend, and I had to get out. On Sunday afternoon, I decided to shower up and go to the local bar to get a beer, some tacos and some human interaction. I called up three of my best friends to ask if they wanted to join, all three of them declined, only making me feel that much more alone. I was going to go regardless of their answers. While at the bar I was wearing my treasured lucky Phish hat. I was sitting there watching the human interactions around me and enjoying my first beer while waiting on my taco order to be cooked when a guy in his late 40‚Äôs (I‚Äôm 24) came up to me on his way to the restroom and said ‚Äúduuuuude I love the Phish hat!‚Äù And pointed at his buddy sitting a few seats away from me and his buddy proceeded to stretch his shirt out so I could see that Dead and Co. was written on it and he then gave me a thumbs up. This instantly brightened up my lonely weekend. There was a couple sitting between the old heads and me at the bar, and the couple didn‚Äôt leave until I finished my tacos and my first beer, which was when I planned on leaving. Once I saw the couple leave I said to myself ‚Äúfuck it, I‚Äôm so lonely.‚Äù And I scooted over a few bar stools to where I was now sitting next to the old heads. I ended up having such a blast with them. I had a few more beers while we talked about everything there is to talk about good music. We talked about how they used to see Phish back in the beginning of the 90‚Äôs when they would just be playing at small bars and stuff like the bar we were at, and I was blown away hearing that. I told them they need to understand how blessed they are because as a 24 year old my chances are very slim of ever getting to see a band like Phish at a venue that small in my lifetime. They talked about how they followed the dead around in the final years with Jerry. They gave me general life advice being that they had 20 years on me. We laughed we drank we had a killer time. There was just so much that we talked about that I can‚Äôt fit it in this post, but put it this way, I drank 4 beers, and I never drink, so that‚Äôs a lot for me, I was there for a while. In conclusion, this is why I love Phish Pham. We are one massive family of brothers and sisters we have yet to even meet in many cases. If you often feel lonely and wish you had more friends that jam out like you, wear some Phish gear in public. Thank you if you read this far, I love each and every one of you beautiful souls.

TL;DR I was having a very lonely weekend, wore my lucky Phish hat alone to a bar, ended up meeting two fellow Phish heads through them seeing my hat, and we had a great evening together and they, my brothers in Phish, helped cure my loneliness.",phish,1513828000,Ymcamatt470767151,26,79,True,2017-12-20

10/31/96 Jesus Grippo Sax Solo,"So....on my daily 34 min and 12 second commute home this afternoon I decided to crank up the inaugural version of ""Cross Eyed and Painless"". 
The last decade has mostly  seen versions that  segue into ""Steam"",  ""Piper"" and then back into ""X-Eyed"" clocking in around  35 min total. The musical costume version is a mere 9+ min so I had about another 20 minutes of drive time left and decided to listen to set three of this Halloween show. 

I'm not sure where in life I overlooked or forgot about Dave Grippo's saxophone solo during ""Jesus Left Chicago"", but holy fucking shit.....I did. And I'm a better man after listening to it this afternoon. 

Literally...sweet Jesus.

Thanks Dave.

Have had a lot of bad experiences with Phans and it seems to be getting worse. What are your thoughts?,"I have listened to Phish for about 15 years now and loved the experience since my first show. I guess compared to most people here I'm a moderate phan. Been to one festival, one multi-night run, and three single shows on different tours. 

Here's my gripe. Over the years my experiences with other phans has just become so unbearable I don't know if I ever want to see them again. 

Getting tickets has become a nightmare with how quick they sellout. That's not the phans fault (I understand supply and demand) but trying to get tickets after a sell out people have been crazy and unnecessarily nasty to me. When someone posted here that they were selling tickets and I said I was interested I got downvoted into oblivion. Whatever, I can deal with down votes. Later that day I see someone PM'd me. I checked it and all it said was ""Fuck you, cunt"" I checked their profile and saw that they were pretty active in /r/phish. What the hell was that about? I've also been downvoted and talked shit to for asking about where / how to get tickets besides just stubhub (cause fuck stubhub) as well as when I asked how the lottery works. 

A few years ago I was the first to comment on a night's poster and said I liked it. I thought it was unique and different but all the other comments said it was bad. That's fine but why did I get so many downvotes with no explanation? Again I'm not trying to complain about losing internet points but just the feeling that comes with the phans reaction. 

As for phans at shows same thing a lot of people here don't like; tarpers, people packing in sections they don't have tickets for, arm flaying dancers, and such. So I don't need to go on about all that. 

I just feel like I'm at such a crossroads right now. I still love the music but I can't deal with the shitty people. Or am I doing something wrong? Thoughts? ",phish,1513969800,Phrow_away_1,30,4,True,2017-12-22

Lost songs of 2.0,"I've been listening through Phish 2.0 recently, and I just finished the summer tour and there are a handful of songs that were only played on that tour but haven't played since that don't get much attention. Some are really nice.

* [Spices](http://phish.in/2003-07-07/spices) - This song has a really light feel to it and great composition. Really liking this one. Only played twice in 2003.

* [Discern](http://phish.in/2003-08-02/discern) - This one feels similar to *spices*, in that the compositional sound has a strong classical influence. Classic Marshall lyrics. Really great song, only played four times, all in Summer tour 2003.

* [Thunderhead](http://phish.in/2003-12-01/thunderhead) - I've always liked this song, it's got a really jazzy feel to it. Again, really good lyrics from Tom Marshall. Played six times, all in 2003.

* [Spread it 'Round](http://phish.in/2003-08-02/spread-it-round) - This song was rightfully left for dead after its second performance at IT.  Teenage pop ditty's have their place, and it's not at a Phish concert. Played twice, both in the Summer 2003 tour.

How is Trey's new rig gonna impact this run?,"Hopefully everyone has seen [Trey's new pedal rig](https://www.facebook.com/CustomAudioElectronics/posts/1447151255401298) which was debuted at the Warren Haynes Xmas Jam. I believe this is Trey's first ever rig overhaul of this level - his [rig video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG-jXPQe1ak) from a few years back still included lots of stuff from the 80s. 

What are we expecting from Trey this run, now that he has all these new toys (well, not necessarily new, but newly arranged)? Will he be more hesitant to use the effects since he won't be as confident in where exactly everything is, or is he going to use way more effects because he's so excited to test everything out?

When the stream buffers and lags and jumps and forces you to constantly reload, and Rosie at LivePhish customer support is too busy being an asshole to actually acknowledge or help with any problems with the shittiest app in existence, do this:


1) Open the stream page on your computer

2) Using your browser, probably in the edit menu, click ‚Äúview page source‚Äù

3) Find a link that starts with ""nugsuniversal-f..."" 

4) Copy that entire link

5) On your computer or smart tv, use VLC to play that link

**Won‚Äôt you step into the freezer? Please her New Years Eve, sir!**


Hello all my lovely r/phish friends! Long time no see. What have y‚Äôall been up to?! Me? I‚Äôm glad you asked. I actually haven‚Äôt listened to much Phish since Dick‚Äôs (shocking I know), and I‚Äôve been really going back and rediscovering some of the bands I was obsessed with in elementary and high school (AC/DC, Van Halen, Queen, and Sabbath to name a few) and living the dream in that I actually scored a gig playing guitar professionally which is INSANE. Either way I‚Äôm glad to be back!

What are our calls for tonight my friends, my friends?! I‚Äôm hoping for Tweezer as I always am, and my personal favorite jam vehicle, everyone‚Äôs favorite chemist, the mighty Reba! I was playing HQ earlier and Scott was spouting off an insane amount of Phish references and he did mention Icculus, so I‚Äôll call that too. Drop your calls in the comments!

I‚Äôm here in the suburbs of Chicago, set up in my living room with my laptop streaming the Phish show and chatting with you folks! Might also be jamming along on [Bertha](http://imgur.com/XY5sZS5), my trusty Fender Starcaster (god she‚Äôs gorgeous)

Enjoy the show, my friends, my friends!

Welcome everyone tonight for night two of this 4 night run at MSG. Last night was a blast and I can't wait to see what they bring tonight. Harry Hood and Slave are already out of the mix, but what else might we get tonight? I was hoping for a Piper after that Twist started up last night, so maybe I'll get it tonight? Will we see a DwD to start set 2? Will it go unfinished? Only time will tell. 

/u/guluvan and I will be tag teaming tonight from rainy Seattle. So check in if you're going to be at MSG and make those song calls and we will do our best to keep things straight up here.

The Jim that it melts into is also quite strong, as well as the set-closing YEM. An unusual but welcome encore choice brings an end to our brief time in Denmark. If this doesn't whet your appetite for the US tour, maybe our next show will...

###Setlist Info (from [Phish.net](http://phish.net/setlists/?d=1998-07-02))  
**Set 1:** Birds of a Feather\*, Cars Trucks Buses, Theme from the Bottom, Brian and Robert, Meat, Fikus, Shafty, Fluffhead, Ginseng Sullivan, Punch You in the Eye &gt; Character Zero  
**Set 2:** Ghost\*\*, Runaway Jim^‚Ä† -&gt; Prince Caspian, You Enjoy Myself^‚Ä†‚Ä†  
**Encore:** Simple  
\* Although straightforward, this version features a soaring solo by Trey.  
\*\* Volcanic rock to Carmina Burana trance which passes through lush oceanic swells to the ring of fire. Intense and fiery ""Ghost"" jamming morphs to pensive, melodic and dark ambient play, then brightens to upbeat and quintessentially '98 ambient transcendence.  
‚Ä† Nice version that gets beyond ""Jim"" into some great ambient jamming.  
‚Ä†‚Ä† Strong jam segment.  
&gt; This show marked the debuts of Meat and Fikus. Fans of stage banter will want to hear this show, as Trey was in a particularly chatty mood.

Help an older phan get back into the loop!,"Hello!

I‚Äôm 44 and have seen Phish a little over 100 times since 1992. I‚Äôve seen them every year they‚Äôve been playing but have been slowing down recently. 

This year was almost going to be the first year I would have missed them. I ended up getting tix for for 12/29 and of course I‚Äôm psyched!

But I‚Äôve been increasingly out of the loop for about the past 5 years. I don‚Äôt follow Phish related news, side projects, social media, forums/message boards, etc. I haven‚Äôt heard much from the past two albums, though I do sometimes follow set lists when they‚Äôre on tour. 

So what‚Äôs going on? What has been the big Phish news stories of the past few years? Is there a rumor about a summer festival? Plans for the future?

How are the last two studio releases? What are a few tunes to start with that touch on the older style of Phish?

I don‚Äôt mind the short ‚Äúradio friendly‚Äù songs but I‚Äôm curious about how they‚Äôve kept in touch with their complex musical roots. Time Turns Elastic(the song) eventually grew on me. What else have they/Trey been writing like that lately?

What up pham? I want to ask you guys...,"I've been a phan for about 20 years. Seen about 20 shows. Love Machine Gunner Trey, Cactus, Henrietta, and Page as musicians. I think that Kuroda is the best lighting guy to have ever lived. Vacuum cleaner is my favorite instrument. I have a huge scar on my face from a glow stick. Etc.

Recently I heard a story that I couldn't believe. A work acquaintance, who knows that I like Phish, told me something very unsettling about Mike Gordon. He told me how he had to pay off parents of a *very young* little girl for taking inappropriate pictures of her. This happened to her alone with him in a secluded boathouse.

I thought dude was cray so I went online and dug around. Unfortunately it does appear to be the case. I was floored. Then disgusted.

I have talked to others who have known about it and all I got was a lot of denial, backpedaling, and rationalizations. One guy, quoting Woody Allen, said to me ""the heart wants what the heart wants"". 

WTF. Seriously? I am as open minded as anyone, but I draw a very hard line when it comes to minors. This girl wasn't just a minor, but a VERY young girl. Gordon, who is not related to her, should have never even been with her alone in such a secluded place. Not that they are to blame, but what were her parents even thinking when they allowed it? Also, did they at least know that Mike was even going to do a 'photo shoot' alone with their kid in a secluded boathouse? Please tell me he didn't just snatch her up and take her there.

I have run this through my head over and over. There is no reason for a grown man to ever take pictures of an unrelated small child all alone. I have children. This is horrifying. The scariest part about it is the number of people that seem okay with it.

With all the news about Hollywood lately everyone seems to be outraged with this type of behavior. Yet, I never even heard about the accusations against Mike Gordon or of the settlement he paid her parents until now. Why the conspiracy of silence? I get that the dude is a good bassist, but I will never spend another cent supporting his work. I am thoroughly disgusted. You guys should be too. Hurting a child is unforgivable. Gordon is a very sick and twisted man.

Any thoughts on the subject?",phish,1510593773,The_Swiss_Eat_Dogs,38,0,True,2017-11-13

No phish crew...How is a show solo?,"Ive been seeing phish since The Great Went. Something like 60 shows total (pre or two a year lately). Most of my buddies who i toured with in the prehiatus days live far away now and I usually end up bringing someone along who isn't really into phish - my brother,  my wife, an open minded friend. I'm always feeling like I have to explain it or convince them or somehow ensure they are having fun. For example during BD my wife just couldn't enjoy herself because of all the smoke. I had fun but kinda missed having someone else who gets it to commiserate with. 

I'm turning 40 this year and I guess i'm not likely to run into a new Phish compatible friend in my little uppermiddleclass section of northern NJ... so I'm thinking about picking up a ticket for 12/28 or 12/29 and rolling solo.

Phish Recommendation System - I need YOUR help community! You're my only hope.,"**NOTE: this is a really long post, and reading isn't your thing I won't be offended, but if you do take the time to read and respond with care, it would make me one happy guy**  
**TLDR: Define the main genre's phish plays, and provide THE song that represents that genre - EG. Funk - Black Eyed Katy 11/16/96**  
**Part 2 TLDR: Do the gumbo results make sense?**

Nobody knows Phish's catalog like you guys do. I listen to phish day in and day out and still would not consider myself an expert, that's why I need the community's feedback as a whole.  
  
If you guys remember my last post here about a month ago, I am building a desktop app phish streaming service with a machine learning recommendation system built into it. There are many steps to this process - We are currently on step 1 of the learning phase which is placing every single song phish has ever played live into clusters based on how similar they sound to each other. The last few days have consisted of putting months of theory into practice for a few trials to see how well this actually does. Computing 30,000+ songs, in addition to downloading them all over the network, is going to take days, and possibly even weeks.   
 
I need two things from you guys in order to both verify this process AND make it better for the final run where we analyze EVERY song together.  
**FIRST**  
If you read the following section first, this may make more sense to you. However, here's the killer question - Phish obviously dips their toes into many genres, straight up ROCK, funk, bluegrass, jazz, compositions, the list goes on. How would you, as a fan, classify their MAIN genres, eg. pick 5, 6, or however many you think really represent them in a meaningful way. THEN, for each of those genres, what SONG would you say is the PINNACLE or QUINTESSENTIAL phish song of them playing that genre. EG. Bluegrass - Blue and lonesome, Jazz - reba, funk - black eyed katy, etc. It would be infinitely more helpful if you could state the actual date of the quintessential song that you list. For example black eyed katy from 11/16/97. What I am essentially looking for is a way to divide phish songs into X number of groups, and by choosing ""THE"" song that represents that group, we will be able to get much more accurate results. What better way to find out what the community wants and would enjoy than getting it from the community itself!


**SECOND**  
My initial test after making sure everything mostly works was with my favorite song of all time, Gumbo. I chose this song because there is certainly a clear distinction between earlier versions (especially with the Giant Country Horns sitting in) and the late 90's funkified versions. To break down how this process is working to any non-technical people out there, I chose three gumbos to be the ""centers"" of their cluster - 8/7/96 Red rocks gumbo (standard, 5 minute, straightforward gumbo), 7/21/91 arrowhead ranch gumbo (giant country horns), and 8/3/98 Deer Creek (funk gumbo). Since there was a sample size of 98 total gumbos, 3 clusters should be enough to see if we are getting any meaningful results in each group. The results will be at the bottom so the text doesn't get bogged down.  
What I am asking of you guys is - Given the chosen song, do the songs that land in that group seem to have some correlation between the way they sound? For example, looking through myself in section 3, the funk gumbo, that boise 9/14/99, and many 1997 gumbos fall into that group so that may indicate a successful analysis. If you see anything that seems out of the ordinary, perhaps a gumbo with horns that ended up in the funk group, please point that out!

"""All of Us Here Have Grown"" or ""How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Stubhub""","The night I finally ""got"" Phish began with me standing outside the Spokane Opera House with my two buddies, bundled up against a reasonably chilly Eastern Washington evening with our fingers in the air. It didn't take long to score (tickets that is), for face value. Jerry was dead, and Phish was on a tear. 

Fast-forward twenty-two years (gasp) and this simple West-Coast boy is now a simple East-Coast dad. Three kids, a loving and forgiving wife, a Honda Odyssey with NJ plates, and a job in middle management that doesn't make us rich by any stretch, but we don't worry for money. What's the point of all this?

Last summer while couch touring ""Jam-Filled"" with my eldest, I once again realized the Phish from Vermont were on fire. For this working Dad, the lottery did not make an appearance on my Outlook calendar however many months ago, nor any of the other on-sale dates. In my mind, I walked through the scenario of my and my 12-yo, standing outside MSG with our fingers in the air, just like all those years ago. Then I thought better. 

I pulled up Stubhub and spent a few minutes muttering ""you've gotta be shitting me"" before selecting two tickets in section 120 (right by the spicy chicken sandos), one for me and one for junior. Total bill? $637 after fees. 

Does that suck? Yeah kinda. But watching my kiddo bob her head to Hood just like I'd done on that night in Spokane 22 years ago, I wouldn't trade that for the world. 

As much as it pains me, thanks Stubhub. Also, fuck you. ",phish,1510805114,phishythrow,25,3,True,2017-11-15

Another intimate setting, similar in size to our previous show in Denmark, gave birth to a humongous show that is still an all-time fan favorite (partly thanks to the impeccable LivePhish treatment it received, and also the video footage that is easily located on YouTube even today). The opening sequence of Buried Alive &gt; Bag -&gt; Ghost -&gt; Cities is a hell of a way to start off. Bag dissolves into dealy loop funk relatively early, and Mike seizes the opportunity to introduce the Ghost theme and tease it for a while before the song truly begins. This Ghost is unbelievable...even after having heard it more times than I can count, it still blows me away with the sheer intensity and energy every time. Cities segues out of the raging end of Ghost, at a tempo much closer to the frenetic pace of the Talking Heads original before a slinky slowdown when Trey realizes he can't sing the lyrics that fast! We get our first taste of Roggae in this set as well, after its debut in Denmark the week before. The late second quarter Maze included an impressively cohesive quick stop in the middle of Trey's solo to appreciate the audience before ripping back into it wonderfully.

Oh yeah, there's a second set as well... The highlight is an all-time classic 20-minute Piper, which rips through the opening segment to get to the juicy meat of the jam, and takes its time building and building and building before mellowing out into a hilarious Makisupa (complete with anti-drum solo). The set closes with a fittingly blistering Loving Cup, and a catchy Possum encore sends us out on a high note. What a show!

###Setlist Info (from [Phish.net](http://phish.net/setlists/?d=1998-07-06))  
**Set 1:** Buried Alive &gt; AC/DC Bag -&gt; Ghost\* -&gt; Cities\*\*, Limb By Limb, Train Song, Roggae^(‚Ä†), Maze^(‚Ä†‚Ä†), Golgi Apparatus  
**Set 2:** Julius &gt; Meat &gt; Piper^‚Ä° -&gt; Makisupa Policeman, David Bowie, Loving Cup^‚Ä°‚Ä°  
**Encore:** Possum^‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°  
\* A bold funk intro that is further highlighted by a raging and intense jam with a peak so high it is unscalable by its most ardent fans...the musical equivalent of absinthe injection by machine gun in a crossfire hurricane. An extended intro leads to a blistering hot straightforward jam.  
\*\* Starts VERY uptempo, but there's a cool, smooth tempo downshift mid-first verse. Cool little guitar solo at the end taboot.  
‚Ä† A more rhythmic and energized jam section than later versions. Great Fish and Trey.
‚Ä†‚Ä† In addition to this being a blistering hot version, at 9:30 the entire band stops on dime in the middle of Trey's solo, Trey thanks the audience, and at 10:00, the band resumes right where it left off.  
‚Ä° Relentless, punishing, and hard rocking jamming place this ""Piper"" squarely in the same company as the 11/19/97 ""Wolfman's Brother"" and 12/29/97 ""DwD."" Like those monsters, this one eventually settles down.  
‚Ä°‚Ä° Trey blazes a trail on his 'doc, RAGING LIKE MAD in this excellent version!  
‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä° Awesome version with a great swingy theme to the jam that Trey keeps returning to. Mike is outstanding, and Page plays the Fender-Rhodes for a stretch, adding to the jazzy feel. Includes a ""Stash"" tease from Trey.  
&gt; Golgi ended with Hip Hop Hooray quotes by Trey. The last line in Makisupa changed to ""came to Vermont."" Trey called Page ""Petroff"" before he took a piano solo. Trey let Fish take a drum solo, but told the crowd to whistle if he (Fish) went on too long.  Trey added that they had a ""band rule"" that they all begin whistling if Fish, who likes to ramble when he talks, ever talks for longer than two minutes. Fish took a boring ""drum solo,"" which drew whistles from the crowd. Piper contained a Lady (Little River Band) tease from Page and Trey and Possum contained a Stash tease from Trey.

Origins of the name ‚ÄúPhish‚Äù,"So apparently back in the very early 80s, Trey heard a joke which brought on the naming of his future band Phish. The joke goes as follows; 

Back in the 60s during the space race, the Russians decided to send a bear into space. They launched the bear up and it was a successful mission, until it was time to return. While the spaceship was headed back towards Earth, the computers had a glitch and the shuttle stopped completely. For 3 weeks the bear was stuck in an unmoving shuttle, until the pull of Earth‚Äôs gravity finally caught the ship and slowly started making it‚Äôs way back home. Unfortunately the space shuttle crashed into the ocean and the bear drowned. When the Russian officials heard this news, one turned to the other and said, ‚ÄúShould‚Äôve sent fish‚Äù.

A letter to Phish and the beautiful community that surrounds them...,"As the 20th anniversary of my first Phish show was approaching, I wanted to let the band know how much I appreciated the last 20 years. While writing this it went from a thank you letter to the band to a thank you letter to the band and the community so on top of mailing it to the band I am also going to post it online.  If you‚Äôre reading this please know that whether or not you‚Äôre a member of the band, and old fan or a new fan, I am glad glad glad that you‚Äôre alive and I am so excited to see what the next 20 years brings. Here goes‚Ä¶

During the mid-nineties, on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee as a camper in the Junior Division of my camp I first heard the band Phish. It was shortly after the release of A Live One and while I enjoyed it quite a bit it did not hit me as hard as Neil Young‚Äôs Decade, which I had also been introduced to. When I went home I fell in love with Harvest, After the Gold Rush and Rust Never Sleeps and did not think much of Phish other than to play the bootlegged tape I made of A Live One. 

When I returned to my summer residence under the pines I was greeted by Chris Wesley, an overzealous counselor who seemed to love one thing more than more than camp, the band Phish. He spent the first day helping us adjust  to cabin life, deal with homesickness and dubbing Phish concert tapes he borrowed from resident Deadhead counselor Clark. While Chris would eventually become a doctor, he was first and foremost a story teller. Chris had an anecdote for every situation, and even though we knew the vast majority were clearly conceived on the spot we hung off of every detail. 

One of my favorite aspects of camp was the musical alarm clock. You woke up and cleaned the cabin to the counselor‚Äôs boom box selection, you ate after mess call and you silently reflected in your bunk as the bugle blew Taps at night. Usually post Taps the counselor would head out in to the night leaving us to talk quietly, and often inappropriately, amongst ourselves until we could no longer keep our eyes open. For Chris, this was his show time. He would play us live versions of Phish songs, tell elaborate stories about their origins and occasionally recreate the light shows of Chris Kuroda with sticks of incense moving swiftly in sync with the music in the pitch black cabin. In the following almost 25 years I have read many of the origins of these songs and while they were fun to hear, they could not hold a candle to the Wesley concoctions. After the first few days Chris informed us that he was going to tell us the most amazing story we had ever heard. He said it was a story so amazing that it would take a few nights to tell it. 

This story was of course Gamehendge and Chris complimented his epic and intricate rendition of the tale with his favorite live versions of each song that he had cued up on his Maxell 90s. It was during the playing of The Lizards that my excitement transitioned from Chris‚Äôs recount to the music itself. The entire cabin was hooked and any opportunity we had, we would mimic the band with our brooms and trunks while listening to bootlegs. While most songs saw campers mimicking the various band members (including flashlight CKs) when The Lizards was on we all played the broom, nodded our heads and tapped our faux foot pedals as we had been told Trey did (as there was no YouTube we took Chris at his word). 

Camp every year was a welcome escape from my awkward, socially uncomfortable life. Things on the lake made sense but even though I was landlocked at home, I found myself drowning.  I always sought solace in music but my tastes were not in line with most kids of my age. When I came back from that summer I was now a Phan and felt that although I was on the outskirts, I was a part of something. I had two close friends who also enjoyed the band and we read everything we could get our hands on. I traded tapes using AOL chat rooms and snail mail. We spent the money we had made doing yard work and washing dishes at a local restaurant on CD‚Äôs, T-shirts and bumper stickers‚Ä¶ so many bumper stickers. We were not cool but damn we felt like we were.
My love of the band grew and grew over the next year so did my feeling of belonging. When the Fall tour was announced in 1997 I thoughtfully planned out an extensive rationalization of why I (a seventh grader) needed to go and when I presented it to my parents. To my surprise, they said I could go to a show for my birthday. My folks were very over protective and still to this day I have no idea what caused them to agree to this. I was even more dumbfounded when they said it would be ok to attend the show the night prior with my best friend, his father and his sister (whom was a Phish vet and our best source for music and info).  In the two weeks leading up to the show we watched the video my friend recoded of the band playing Farmhouse on Conan (ever so gently dubbed over Skinamax‚Äôs finest) a million times. 

I doubt I slept more than three hours a night leading up to November 29th and when the day arrived I was over the moon. I remember my friend‚Äôs father parking at the Aku Aku parking lot and asking his sister what the meaning of the 4:20 bumper sticker was. I could hardly breathe as I walked through huddled masses with extended pointer fingers, hemp neck adornments, patchwork everything and warm greetings for friends both present and future. Once inside the venue we walked briskly through the crowd and at one point I spied a classmate who was there with his brother. This kid was much cooler than I and there were few places where our paths would cross but this was one! I tapped into my inner Clint Eastwood and gave the most cool casual head nod I could as if to say ‚ÄúI belong here‚Äù. We found seats mid level, which were not the ones listed on my ticket, and as we waited to for the show to start I thought my heart was going to beat out of my chest. As I turned to say something to my friend the lights went out and the crowd went nuts. 

When the band started playing I was mesmerized. I wish I could say I remembered more details of the music but the majority of my many memories have been fabricated over the years as I have listened to the show countless times. I only knew a handful of the songs played that night (most notably The Sloth from my time at camp) and I was blissfully unaware of the fact that I was witnessing the longest jam in Phish history. I do remember Trey telling the crowd the Buffalo Bill was Fishman‚Äôs favorite song. 
I returned to the Centrum again the following night and traveled down 95 for night one of the Island Tour (my first lizards) and kept coming back. My core group of friends centered around Phish, we continued to read every article and book, traded tapes via snail mail and for the first time in my life I had something to look forward to, it was a place where I fit in, a place where I could be myself and say nice things to nice people without worrying about what the those around me would think. While my biological family was warm and loving, I was a thorn in their side and they couldn‚Äôt understand me; this other family understood me. 

Although I was only able to take in a handful of shows before the fateful Friday the 13th when I was riding the elevator to the 13th floor of a hotel (they do exist) in Albany when the hotel employee said ‚Äúsorry to hear about your boys‚Äù as she pointed to my Phish shirt. I couldn‚Äôt believe it when she said the newspaper had a big story about the breakup of the band. I raced to the room and used the phone to call my friend who confirmed it. I had no idea what I would do. While the band was gone the basic roaming area of the family was within‚Äô reach and as most kids do when their parents are gone, I experimented. 

By the time the Hampton shows were announced I was in my Freshman year of college. I had no business being in school and I had begun to spiral a bit. I had gone from experimenting to mastering and when the full tour was announced I picked up and left school for two weeks, which I understood would be the end of my good college try. While most people would say this was a crazy decision please be aware that while I took off to hit a few shows, did not pass a single class that semester and was not allowed to reside on campus (do to partying with tourmates) I was actually invited back for my sophomore(ish) year, I assume because my lone year of college was paid in cash. 

After school I started working full time at a Residential program for at-risk-youth where I finally found my calling. I loved working with the kids and while my days were filled with hard dedicated work my nights and weekends were still spent steeped in excess. This culminated in a smattering of shows in 2004 leading up to Coventry. Musical highlights from these runs are limited as I was pretty drunk and likely on something(s) else at this point. While I may have been a bit out of control I still felt very close to the community. The shows were my escape from the stresses of life and work.  While I was living outside my mental means while in the community, I would have likely done this anywhere. 

Coventry hurt. Aside from a nearly 500 mile walk into the venue, which would have made an amazing movie, that weekend was not a good one. I left that venue alone in many more ways than one and although it took a bit I decided that this would not be how I remembered this band, my band, my family. 

In the time between what we generally refer to as 2.0 and 3.0 I was maturing. I had found a population of kids who needed me and while I was charged with teaching and leading them I feel I gained more from them then they could ever take from me. Even thought the kids were primarily from the inner city and did not connect with the band or family the majority of the things I was able to teach them came from my experiences with Phish.  I taught them that even if they couldn‚Äôt connect to someone in their immediate vicinity, reach father. If someone has a problem with you being happy find better friends. Be you, no matter who that is.
When the band came back in 2009 I was in a different place altogether had grown in many ways. I had met who would eventually become my wife, I had begun to slow down on nights and weekends and was looking beyond the next show. I had begun to replace bad habits with good and instead of drowning my problems I was facing them. When the band announced they were coming back I was ecstatic. The vibe outside Fenway was amazing, I saw people I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. Smiles were from ear to ear and there was a new wave of wide eyed younger fans. I quickly realized that I was now a part of the cultural fabric that I was previously in awe of.  When the band took the stage (mound) I got a bit choked up and before long I realized I had been dancing like nothing changed. During Stash I realized that not only was the band back but they were as good as they have ever been. 

I have been faithfully attending shows ever since, and while I may not ‚Äúrage‚Äù as hard as I used to I am so very appreciative of every single note. I went 50 shows between my first and second Lizards but the second one was the sweetest I have ever heard. In a year that saw me battle crippling anxiety that held me prisoner in my own home for an extended period of time I fought like hell to get back on my feet in time for MSG. While large crowds and noises were still difficult to deal with I packed into the Garden with no issues knowing that when the boys came out I all would be ok. When they brought the van out on the floor and started playing classics I knew something special was happening. Then I heard the fateful notes again. Tears poured out of my eyes, tears of joy, tears of triumph, tears of happiness and love.  It was a feeling that I was pretty sure I would never feel again. After the show ended in a euphoric haze I looked at my phone and saw that I had roughly 15 different texts from companions all with the same time stamp congratulating me on finally getting my second Lizards.

While I have now been blessed to have been a part of five Lizards performances, and while I did cry during each of them, none will ever match the JEMP Lizards. I did however feel that feeling again, in fact I have felt it twice now during and after the births of my two amazing daughters. If I were to tell anyone outside of the community that I could compare the feeling of the birth of my children to a song I heard a band play live I would be met with rolled eyes and assumptions of consumption but I am fairly certain that many people in this community would understand. 

My job is my identity and while it pays very little it provides me with more wealth than I could spend in ten lifetimes. Over the years I have seen kids die, pull weapons on me, have the system fail them a million times, be abused by their families, be abused by the people paid to take care of them, be looked over, judged by their skin, judged by their appearance, forgotten, exploited and ignored but I have been strong and stood up for them at every turn. I have been defeated more than I have been victorious but I have never backed down and I owe much of this to Phish and their community for many reasons.  It was this community that taught me that I am not just good, but I am great and I am capable of anything. They have taught me that it‚Äôs ok to be happy and it‚Äôs ok to share that happiness with those around you. They have given me the friendships  that I rely on for support, love and compassion when I am feeling low. And on top of this the band has given me the promise of another show. No matter how bleak the situation is, if I can just hold on a bit longer I can get to the next show and dance ‚Äòtill I am well again. 

So when Phish played the JEMP Lizards I took over 10 years of emotional baggage (good, bad and ugly) and cast it into the rafters. Tears flowed throughout the song and my smile had never been bigger. It all made sense finally. I had read all of the chapters but finally understood the true message of The Book (you know the one?). This feeling was so pure, happy and freeing and I only wish that everyone was entitled to feel this way at least once in their life. I have been blessed to feel this way three times now and while I may have peaked I am so happy. My two year old enjoyed her first show from the amazing family section in the grass during the last SPAC run and I can‚Äôt wait until my one month old is ready for her first show (keep playing SPAC it‚Äôs the only venue I‚Äôd take a kid to!). While my girls may not love Phish as much as I do as they get older, I hope they are able to love something the way I love Phish, whether it be a band, a hobby, a location, movie or a cause. 

So I guess what I am trying to say is thank you. Thank you for being who you are. Thank you for always striving to be better. Thank you for being there for me. Thank you for providing me with the space to discover who I am and the confidence to walk off the lot and into the real world as that person. Thank you for the jams, the ballads, the silly and the serious. Thank you for the festivals and not to be missed Sunday shows.  Thank you for the outlet. Thank you for the community, the love and most of all thank you for the music. 

Still upside down,
OB

My own Phish Radio show!!! 12/27,"So I have been given the amazing opportunity to host a radio show on an nyc internet radio station. It's a non-profit broadcast found here:  http://makerparkradio.nyc 

I will certainly be doing it for fun only (no one will be making any money at all on this) and I just want to spread the love of my favorite band. I was wondering if the phans here could help me with a few questions I have. 

1. I was thinking of making the name of the show ""What's The Use?"" as it is a favorite tune of mine and the song would be perfect backing music to the intro and times when I'm talking. But what else could/should I include in the title to make it a little more fun? Maybe just ""What's The Use? Phish and Fun for your Ear and Soul"" or something similar.

2. I have 2 hours to play whatever I want. I want to put up some of my favorite jams that I have heard recorded and witnessed live. What do you think about skipping or talking over some of the intro or composed sections that lead into the best parts of what these guys can do. I'm on the night before the MSG NYE shows (the 27th) and with only 2 hours to use, I feel like skipping the first few minutes of a Tweezer here, or a Jim there, might make things more fluid. 
Any thoughts?

3. Any requests? I've already got Clfford Ball's Reba, and I think 4/4/98 Birds, but beyond the heavy hitters any help with some gems would be very much appreciated.",phish,1512188544,freefromthenegative,4,4,True,2017-12-01

It's currently available on both Windows and Mac machines. I'm posting this here in the hopes that we can start receiving some actual feedback on how it feels to use the app on a regular basis.  
  
You can download the app for either OS here https://chrissbendel.github.io/hose/  

Some screenshots of how the app looks! https://imgur.com/a/v7ZW1  

This app is definitely not complete, and we are working on it every single day. There *should* be automatic updates bundled with the installers, so if we push out an update, you should get it as well. Since this is a beta, you guys are the most important part of this whole process - Any and all feedback helps, so feel free to contact me at chrissbendel@gmail.com with any issues, comments, or questions.

"Possible ticket for sale for Trey Acoustic on 2/10 in Cambridge, MA - Orchestra Section G.","I jumped the day of the pre-sale after reading on this sub that all the tickets sold out in 3 min. I can't make NYE this year which would cost quite a bit to sit where I like / arrange for accommodations so I paid the stub hub price gouge (evil) price of $535.50 for **1** ticket in section G of the orchestra section - best / closest section, I believe. 

It's only a 1000 person venue. 

Anyway, I saw Trey at carnegie hall for my 13th birthday in 2009 with my mother who had never seen him. it was a fond memory that we both remember and she loved the experience. 

my parents know I paid a bunch for this febuary ticket and my mom inquired about going but, even though we live comfortably, wouldn't spent 500 dollars on herself for pretty much anything. however, my dad offered for me to sell the ticket I bought and purchase two more tickets in the same section as a christmas gift for her (one of his friends has two for sale through a work connection). 

If someone on here is interested then I would pull the trigger and hopefully have another amazing experience with my mother, who puts herself before everyone else at any cost, almost 9 years later (time flies, I still feel like i'm 13). 

That was a bit too clich√© / sappy and wordy but that's the story. If someone's interested comment or PM me and I won't charge you a dime more than I paid + shipping. ",phish,1512510069,throwaway929892988,13,1,True,2017-12-05

I've heard this a lot but I've never really thought about it. people like to joke about how jam bands will play the same song for 30 minutes to an hour, and that's the main point that they like to complain about. But little do they know if Phish played the same song for an hour we wouldn't stop talking about it for a long time. The very thing they complain about is what we live for. Just a little bit of irony I was mulling over today. I've also realized that most people are under the impression that they assume that it's just the same Verse Chorus Verse Chorus Verse Chorus over and over again for however long.

Phish streaming app (Updates),"Hey /r/phish - Hope I am not bothering anybody with a second post, however the first one got buried and I just wanted to give everybody a quick update on the app.  
  
Since the last post, we have made a ton of changes in the app (visually and behind the scenes things). The most important change was getting auto updates working for windows (as it was not working before).   

The main reason for this post is so that windows users can be aware of the fact that older versions are not working with windows updates, so they need to download the latest version in order to stay up to date in the future! 

Here are some screenshots of the latest UI changes https://imgur.com/a/rHafr  
  
Download the most recent version here - https://chrissbendel.github.io/hose/  
  
PS. I just want to say thank you for the overwhelming first round of support, feedback, and constructive criticism. It really motivates me to make this better and better. Tons of updates are still to come.  
  
One more thing, the upcoming feature I am, and I hope all of you are, excited about is something we'll call Phish Radio. I posted here about a month back asking for feedback on some results of my clustering algorithm, which will feed into the phish radio feature.  
  
Phish radio will be a feature where you can queue up a song, and then from that song the radio will automatically select the best match for the next song in the playlist - You as a user will be able to provide feedback to the radio's song suggestions, which will get fed back into the neural network that powers the recommendation system. The more you vote ""good"" or ""bad"", the smarter the system gets and the better suggestions you will receive! I think this feature will be a big hit with you guys - Personally I would use it while at my job to throw on some music in the background and not be bothered by picking tracks or shows to listen to specifically. This will be coming in an update soon, so be on the lookout! Thanks again - And I hope it was okay if I posted this update here.",phish,1512579604,Phiive,17,25,True,2017-12-06

WHY DID I LEAVE THEM? My Story of Rediscovery.,"*[A bit long and I'm feeling nostalgic]* 

Through my late 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs and now 40‚Äôs, I have looked back on two poignant points of my life with great fondness.  There are countless times in my 20‚Äôs I‚Äôd rather forget, but these two events have transcended time ‚Äì The Great Went and Big Cypress.  

I saw Phish for the first time when I was 22, the summer before my second year at college.  I bartended all summer, slept with some beautiful women, and ended my summer of fun camping with my brother, sister, and best friend up in the northern reaches of Maine.  The Great Went closed down my best summer ever.

Big Cypress was a different story.  I was a new college graduate with a few dollars in my pocket living in Louisville, KY.  My brother lived in Miami.  He suggested it, I said F-It, then made my reservations for spending Y2K up alligator alley.  We rented a U-Haul, packed two cars worth of people, a few tents, tarps, couch, grill, and whatever other amenities could fit in a 32 foot diesel behemoth.    

Some time mid-show, I‚Äôm on video smoking a bowl while my brother asks me what my New Year‚Äôs resolution is.  ‚ÄúFind a new job‚Äù I responded.  That resolution came true.  In July of ‚Äô00, I moved back to my roots in DC and quickly met the one who would later become my wife and mother of 4 awesome kids.  

Phish faded into the rear view mirror.  They became the past as my wife and career became the present and future.

I heard they still toured.  I heard Trey got arrested.  Then I heard there was a breakup.  Sometime later came Hampton.  Growing up in DC, it‚Äôs widely known that place was special.  I really didn‚Äôt think twice about Phish, but thought it would be a fun run for the noobs.  

15 years pass and in late 2016, I get shared a ‚ÄúPhish Riviera Maya 2017‚Äù FB post by my sister.  ‚ÄúSiblings trip!‚Äù  My family was there with me at the Great Went and I was with my brother at Big Cypress.  FUCK IT!  Let‚Äôs do it.  Sign me up.  What do they say?  ‚ÄúOne of two things happen at a Phish show.  Either you have a great time, or you have religious experience.‚Äù

That weekend in Cancun was amazing.  The lights, the water, the band, the vibe.  It was all there and it all flooded back into me.  2017 tickets had codes for LivePhish downloads.  From that point on, I listened to every bit of Phish I could get into my MP3 player.  My YouTube history was nothing but Phish shows.  Songs they played at the Barcelo turned into songs that were highly rated on Phish.Net.  I found a new obsession.

Unbeknownst to my family, I put my name into the lottery for the MSG Bakers Dozen run.  We were vacationing in NH for a few weeks this summer and I picked two days in which we could swing a drive down to the city.  I picked 7/25 and 7/26.  I ‚Äúwon‚Äô both nights.

Jam Filled was history in the making and I am still shocked I was lucky enough to be a part of it.  The entire run I was glued to the online streams and the live threads here on /r/Phish.    

I closed out the summer couch touring the final Sunday at Dicks.  The house was shaking and I got to dance with my daughter during Wedge, one of my favorite jams.   I was completely content and happy.  My only thoughts were what song are they going to play next and how quickly can I call it?

Today is a lazy October Sunday and I‚Äôm wrapping up the 2nd set of the 1998-04-03 show at the Nassau Coliseum during the Island Tour.  I can say that this band has added something to me that was missing for a long time and I will not let that feeling go.  Every time I drink from the Phish cup these days, I get drunk.  What a beautiful buzz.

Trey Anastasio (2002),"I loved this album when it came out 15 years ago... I listened to it today for the first time in years.  Here's my review:

Mixing Latin rhythms, jazzy grooves, funk workouts, and bluesy rock riffs, Trey brings together almost all of the elements Phish had touched on in their nearly 20 years on the road by this time.  He doesn‚Äôt really touch bluegrass or country, but he does look toward what would become his own infatuation with classical arrangements. He would eventually release a fully orchestral album and play a handful of live performances with symphonies over the next decade and a half.  And although the genre mixing and matching sometimes resembles Phish, the songwriting seems to be a bit more mature, nuanced, and all around less goofy (for good and for bad). Trey sings earnestly throughout, often backed by Jennifer Hartswick.  Not many tongue in cheek lyrics here.  And nothing too nonsensical. There are plenty of solos and extended instrumental sections, but for the most part the band fully commits to laying down a rhythm, setting the stage for Trey to be the lone improviser.  Though the bass lines are often simple and repetitive, the drumming and percussion are effective in keeping the groove moving.  The funky organ playing and boisterous horn section provide an excellent counter point to Trey‚Äôs often wild guitar lines.  

What do you think?

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to appreciate Phish.","The music is extremely eclectic, and without a solid grasp of genres most of the musical cues will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Trey‚Äôs extensive music background, which is deftly woven into his guitar playing ‚Äì his oeuvre draws heavily from jazz and bluegrass, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this music, to realize that they're not just 20 minute songs about marsupials- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Phish truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour Hayley‚Äôs Comet‚Äôs lyrics ""I love meatballs so you better be ready"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy.

Weird stat request/puzzle,"I've been trying to think about how to even figure this question out conceptually and I'm not sure, and haven't seen it over on .net's stat area; hopefully one of you heady logician CS heads can shed some light on this:

Premise: There's no way to guarantee that you see a certain song at any given show, but past performances are the best indicator of future likeli(hood) performances. 

Question: So, based on past shows (excluding Halloween cover shows), what is the shortest playlist you could make that would guarantee that any past show, randomly selected, would be guaranteed to have at least 1 song from your playlist?

I figure this gets as close as possible to approximating a playlist that you could give to someone prior to taking them to a show that would guarantee that they hear at least 1 song they've heard before. 

Other than brute forcing it by starting with a set of the most commonly played and somehow running the check and then eliminating one at a time, I'm not sure how you would figure it out.

Take a look at a song like [Inca Roads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCq8ltUsIog), which was basically Zappa's ""Reba"" - silly lyrics and a complex/difficult composed section, followed by a long, guitar-led blissful jam.

Songs that define each year,"I was just thinking about what individual songs would define each year of Phish.  It could be that the song got played a lot in a particular year, that the song got jammed a lot in a particular year, or even that the song debuted in a particular year.  
  
The only one I can think of right now is 1995, which to me was defined by Free.  The song certainly got played a decent amount in '95, but it also usually included Trey on his percussion set which also stands out to me as a memorable part of '95 (though usually not in a good way).  
  
I might say that Down with Disease defined 1994, since it basically debuted in '94 and was played quite a bit that year.  There were also some stand-out versions in '94.  
  
Ghost might be 1997.

I can say, with all honesty, that when its not crackling, the sound is AMAZE-BALLZ! (im listening to yem right now). great master so far.
 
A $100 record should be pretty noiseless on the first spin.

Esther - Retold,"Hello all!
I'm currently writing a short story for a literary magazine near me. The topic as I'm sure you have already figured out is a more fleshed out story of Esther. Esther is one of my favorite songs, and really solidified my interest in Phish before I had much more exposure. If any of you have the time I would like some input on the quality and and if it follows close enough to the original story for die-hard fans to appreciate. If you think something is wrong or maybe you just have some advice on really capturing the feel, I would appreciate the advice. I've taken a few creative liberties to make the story flow better and put emphasis on the things I find important to the story. The piece is tentatively called, ""Murk on the Curb.""

In the north western part of Vermont, along the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, was the quiet town of Burlington; a seemingly perfect place to settle down and live your life. The majority of inhabitants were quite friendly with each other, always stopping to say hello or ‚ÄúHow is your mother?‚Äù Certainly no one from the outside would be able to see the sulking shadow hanging over the town and it‚Äôs people.

One such citizen was a little girl by the name of Esther. Esther was 10 years old. She enjoyed going to school, playing with her friends, and most of all playing with dolls. You see, although most of the town was relatively well off, Esther‚Äôs family was not. Her father had left before she was born, too afraid of the responsibilities that come with parenthood. The situation never improved as Esther‚Äôs mother periodically fell in and out of bouts of alcoholism. Every birthday Esther begged her mother for a pretty doll, but was always left disappointed.

Just down the road from Esther‚Äôs home were the fairgrounds. Every year during October they held a large fair. Although playing with dolls was Esther‚Äôs favorite thing to do, the fair was a close second. Unfortunately, she never had money to go. She was content with standing on the outside observing the lights and sounds from a distance.

‚ÄúSomeday I‚Äôm going to save up my money and go to the fair. . .‚Äù whispered Esther to herself.

As she finished her sentence, Esther noticed a man clad in black robes. A black so black it seemed to pull in the lights and sounds of the fair nearby and twisted them into a sort of otherworldly glow around him. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that light?‚Äù Thought Esther as the man ducked into a hole in the fence surrounding the fairgrounds. ‚ÄúWhat is he up to?‚Äù

Esther crept up to the spot where she saw the man disappear moments earlier. As she got closer the thoughts of the man in black seemed to fade into the back of her mind. She had an opportunity to make one of her dreams come true now, not later, at this very moment. Elated, Esther crawled through that same hole which the strange man entered.

As soon as she exited the hole Esther‚Äôs whole world was turned upside down. She could hear the music better than ever, instead of light spinning around she saw the Ferris Wheel for what it truly was. She saw people smiling and laughing. She saw people interact with one another, greeting each other much the same as they would on the street. Always formal, and polite but never getting too close. This didn‚Äôt bother Esther, she was used to the personal space afforded to each member of the community. They just liked their space. It was normal, and besides, Esther was in heaven.

The sights and sounds of the fair were overwhelming, drowning out all other thought‚Äôs in the little girl‚Äôs mind. Not long though the smells of fried dough, corn dogs, and all things delicious made her painfully aware of the rumbling in her stomach. She hadn‚Äôt eaten since the night before. She had some spare change but 37 cents were just not going to cut it. She headed towards the trash cans. Surely, someone must have discarded a treat for her to find.

Digging through the garbage Esther‚Äôs found what she was looking for, a half-eaten piece of fried dough, and a small tuft of cotton with barely any spit on it. She happily plucked them from the bin and began to eat.

‚ÄúLittle girl,‚Äù she heard coming from behind her. 

Suddenly ashamed of what she was doing she dropped the snacks to the ground and turned to face the punishment she was sure to receive. When she turned she found the man with robes darker than the absence of light standing behind her. From here she got a much better look at the man. He looked quite unusual compared to the rest of the town.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry mister, I didn‚Äôt mean any harm. I‚Äôm just so hungry.‚Äù Pleaded Esther.

The man seeming to understand her situation produced a fresh piece of fried dough and a large wad of cotton candy. Esther smiled politely as she had seen the townsfolk do many time, and thanked the man. As he approached Esther took note of his strange features. His skin had a yellowish hue, not exactly like someone who was ill but more like someone who had recently passed and was on display at a funeral home. The yellowish flesh seemed to hang off of his face like a mask but it was certainly attached. She could see fluid leaking from his left ear, running down his face with his long grey hair stuck to it. And the smell, oh god the smell! He smelled of rotting fish and peppermint. In his hand she spied a bucket that she was sure must contain fish, after all, he did look a bit like a fisherman from out of town.

He said, ‚ÄúLittle girl, you can chop off my legs, and then peel off my socks if you want to.‚Äù A sly grin stretched across his face nearly ear to ear. This was not like the smile she had offered him earlier. Instead he had a double set of teeth that took on the appearance of a saw. Each of his front teeth were offset from the second row of teeth. Most were topped with a little point, a few of them filed down or broken. 

The man threw his head back in laughter when he saw the scared look on her face. She could see his eyes now. There was a mischievous glint to them from the lights and rides around them. She couldn‚Äôt explain why but it made her uncomfortable.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù the word seemed to drag out for days as Esther stood in terror. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you take this old puppet from me that I hold in my pail as we speak.‚Äù

Forgetting the danger at hand, Esther ran up to the man as fast as her malnourished legs could carry her. The man tilted the bucket toward her. She saw the black button eyes of the doll and knew she couldn‚Äôt resist.

Thanks in advance for any, and all input.

"Show Discussion Thread - April 4, 1998 - Providence Civic Center, Providence, RI","You can find previous entries in this series [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VLbS92cgTR9FAkflFrWZarr_pmuNFPVvcdU8GzBqEUU/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks to the [enthusiastic response](https://www.reddit.com/r/phish/comments/78r6z0/does_anyone_want_to_bring_back_show_of_the_week/) to /u/jeffray123's post, I figured it might be time to try bringing this series back. Thinking that making it a weekly feature instead of three shows a week (dear God what was I thinking) will increase interest and avoid burning myself out. I'll be including streaming links so you can hear the show yourself, as well as the above spreadsheet where you can see all 128(!) previous entries in this series. Please leave a comment if you have thoughts or suggestions for the continued success of Historical Show Discussions!

The third of four Island Tour shows shifts venues to the Providence Civic Center, a few hours north of Long Island. Those of us who made the trek from last night's show are rewarded with a Tweezer that follows the Tweeprise closer from the previous night - and this one is a top-shelf opener, a portent of things to come for the rest of the night. The Taste that it leads into is no slouch either, high-powered and characteristically full of tension/release. Limb by Limb features a pretty tight (for the era) solo from Trey and a typically high-energy Zero closes set one. The second set is significantly better, although IMO falling just short of the epicness from Providence II. The second rendition of BOAF goes nearly twice as long as the first, and while the band might not have enough of a well-defined template to begin experimenting and breaking away from it, you can hear plenty of suggestions here for how to do that in later renditions. After fizzing out a bit, Fishman picks up the 2001 beat and the funk bridge from 1997 is in full effect here. 16 minutes and unfinished, they go into a bit of a vocal percussion jam instead of the reprise of the theme, which connects (via Trey's delay loop) into Brother as you've never heard it before. I'll let the setlist notes from Phish.net set the stage for this one (you can find them with the setlist details at the bottom of this post). The Ghost that follows is probably underrated now, not being on the .net jam chart, but it's still one of my favorites (and not just because I'm a big Blues Brothers fan). The cherry on top is a throwback ending with Bowie to close the set and a Hood encore. At this point the Island Tour is right up there with Hampton/Winston-Salem and Virginia Beach/Walnut Creek/Lakewood as the best threepeat of shows since the madness of July 1993.

**Set 2:** Birds of a Feather^‚Ä† &gt; 2001^‚Ä†‚Ä† &gt; Brother^‚Ä°, Ghost^‚Ä°‚Ä° -&gt; The Lizards, David Bowie  
**Encore:** Harry Hood  
\* Some wonderful space-funk evolves into stellar, full-band, magnificent improv.  
\*\* Mike is really rock solid here, underpinning the harmonic base off of which Trey and Page shine. Still, this version doesn't have quite the ""extra mustard"" of many '97 versions.  
‚Ä† Elongated and groovy version suggests several possible future jamming directions while never straying too far from ""Birds"" itself.  
‚Ä†‚Ä† Haunting intro and a grooving minimalist first jam. Trey pounces at the 9 minute mark and another Island Tour masterpiece is created.  
‚Ä° About 4:38 into the conventional ""Brother,"" this one departs into a great, funky jam. Way beyond the standard, it nonetheless builds in tension and dissonance as the jam progresses. Includes a brief ""DEG"" tease. After the song, the band played a brief ""radio friendly"" reprise.  
‚Ä°‚Ä° Trey jokingly remarks this is also not radio friendly, because it is long and slow. Includes ""Can't Turn You Loose"" tease (Blues Brothers theme).

Vegas Golden Age - One Year Later [+Video],"A year ago tomorrow, I experienced the Phish show that changed my life forever. It wasn't the ""best"" show I've ever been to, but it literally changed my life in a way no other concert ever has - and this is even with the Jam-Filled recency bias.

[If only video existed of the Vegas Golden Age!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AZM4MMZ40ET0NZWERxOHRJRHM) They seemed to be pulling every link that was put up from anything the entire Halloween run, which has me hoping against hope for a DVD box set. [Well, it sure would be cool if someone had gotten ahold of the webcast.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AZM4MMZ40ET0NZWERxOHRJRHM) For those of you running a little slow on a Friday, there are two hyperlinks in this paragraph - give one of them a try! Listen to 14:43 and 21:32 if nothing else, to experience the two high-flying peaks.

Let me set the scene: 10/28/2016 was the first night of a 4-night run in Vegas for Halloween, and happens to be a Friday. This meant Halloween was on a Monday, so a lot of people saved the PTO and flew in Friday after work or Saturday morning and missed the Friday show. No big deal, right? Unused tickets were literally all over the floor outside the entrance to the venue. I still wonder if any MGM patrons picked up a free ticket and caught the show for free.

The first set was incredible IMO, with a solid song selection. Is it possible to have a sub-par set when MM &amp; NMINML open the set and Cavern &amp; WotC close it? The answer is no.

Crimes of the Mind opened the second set, but what we're here to talk about is the second song in the second set, the highest peak Phish has hit in 3.0: The Vegas Golden Age.

Play-by-Play

* 0:00- Cover song; a tight version, but nothing to write home about compared to other performances.
* 4:15- The usual Trey solo out of the last chorus.
* 7:05- Abruptly drops into a Type II jam. You start to get the impression that this could be different. The jam is a bit dissonant at first as the band finds its footing, and they quickly move into a tight groove. Page carries melody, but Mike &amp; Jon are the MVP's of this beginning section.
* 9:13- Trey takes over lead. Mike turns on this filthy distortion effect.
* 10:02- Classic Page/Mike groove with Jon playing snare/hi-hat exclusively.
* 11:24- Trey takes lead. While he sustains notes, Page &amp; Mike fill in gaps.
* 13:04- Same basic melody, just ""more"" from every band member.
* 13:44- Trey/Page begin melody that will continue through peak.
* 14:43- You can feel the peak coming. Calm before the madness.
* 15:22- Pay attention to Page's part here! These few bars are what he repeats to drive this peak.
* 15:27- Trey locks in. He's the focal point of the blissful peak here, but Page holds it together. Great interplay between the two. Builds w/ sustain from Trey until wild peak (17:11-18:19).
* 18:31- I turn to the guy next to me and say, ""Wow, that was unexpected."" I figured we were ready to move on. Mike keeps the energy going.
* 19:45- Page leads. Trey teases something between Sand and Take Five.
* 21:05- Trey takes lead back from Page. Increase in tempo and energy.
* 21:32- ""Wait, there's no way this jam hits a second peak...""
* 22:24- You can tell what's on the way - the entire band is so tight and focused.
* 23:16- Band locks in for peak.
* 24:07- Amazing blissful peak #2 starts in, and keeps getting more high energy and intense as only Phish jams can. Very different from the first peak.
* 24:59- Just when you think it couldn't be pushed further...
* 25:33- Peak ends, and drops directly into Simple riff. Crowd exhales collectively.

I'm looking to buy some Phish posters and prints ‚Äî can anyone give me a quick introduction to how the poster/print scene works?,"Hey phriends!

I've finally become a real adult, and purchased an apartment I can call my own :) The only thing missing is some artwork on the walls!

I'm looking to get a few Phish posters to decorate the place with. I'm not picky about which shows they're from, though if they were from [any of the shows I've attended](http://phish.net/user/jwh21/shows), that would be a nice bonus.

I'd love either a set of three from the same run, or alternatively three different show posters that are identically sized but look good together aesthetically. My plan is to get them framed, and hang them up as a triptych.

---

So, a few questions from a poster noob...

I've seen /r/PhishPrints, and I'm aware of ExpressoBeans, but not quite sure how to go about getting started.  To complicate things further, I live in the UK, so any sellers would need to ship there.

1. Is there anywhere else that people go to buy posters? I know there's eBay, but is that trustworthy, or should I be looking somewhere more closely linked to the Phish scene?
2. I don't have anything to trade, so would need to go cash-only ‚Äî but I see some sellers only want to trade. Anything I can do about this, or am I just looking in the wrong place?
3. I was surprised to see how high the asking prices are for some of these posters. What's the ""poster economy"" like? What dictates the value of a print? Presumably limited print runs dictate higher prices ‚Äî but I've seen a few around that don't seem to follow this pattern.
4. I also found http://phishposters.com, but it seems you need to be approved to get access... I'm just imagining some elite, underground poster trading group over there haha. Is that site any good? I registered, but nobody's approved my account yet, and I don't really know what to expect if/when I get in...
5. I'm seeing sometimes 4 or 5 different posters, by different artists, for the same show. I'd always thought there was just one or two official prints per show. Have I got that wrong? Or are these non-official / tribute pieces instead?

Any advice on getting started would be welcome! Thanks in advance :)",phish,1509289792,salsa_sauce,18,7,True,2017-10-29
Favorite Underrated Jams,"I am aware that these threads happen a lot, but I have three jams on my mind that I want to put down really quick.

[10/22/16 - Stash](https://phish.in/2016-10-22/stash):
It kills me that this jam is not even a recommended jam on .net because Trey really brings the heat. Straight 94 tension and release on this bad boy. I don't know if I just have an emotional connection to it because this was my first and only show, but this is something special to me. I had never partaken in a glowstick war and this had been a dream of mine once I saw footage of the Magna Tweezer-&gt;Caspian, and right when this song started, someone gave me a handful of glowsticks and said ""get ready, kid"" (I was 16 at the time). I was heavily anticipating the peak, but Trey would tease a peak then pull it back just edging us for the musical orgasm that was the finale. 

[11/22/94 - Funky Bitch](https://open.spotify.com/track/5P1M2BpOIiMA2WULQVunYI):
This one is far less underrated, however I think it should go down as one of Phish's greatest jams and I barely hear people talking about it. Gordo brings the HEAT to the vocal part, almost to the extent that I thought they brought in a guest singer. If you think the magic ends there though, the jam goes all over the place. That classic 94 tension, some ambiance, Phish burning the motherfucker down, dissonance, then a segue into Yerushalayim Shel Zahav, continuing the darkness of this beautiful jam. If you haven't heard this monster, give it a shot.

[6/18/94 You Enjoy Myself](https://open.spotify.com/track/36HKNL7U2JuGoRVC3b7kOc):
Phish's best YEM, prove me wrong. There is one moment in particular that sets this jam apart for me, and that's when Trey does this deal where he layers on effects, giving the feeling of the room being covered in ice crystals, then hits this hammer on melting the frost he just laid over UIC Pavilion. I don't know how else to put it, but it's one of those things that makes you wonder how a human can come up with this off the top of their head. Absolutely beautiful and multi-faced YEM that is my favorite track off of the Chicago 94 box set.

"Show Discussion Thread - April 5, 1998 - Providence Civic Center, Providence, RI","Setlist

SET 1: The Oh Kee Pa Ceremony &gt; You Enjoy Myself, Theme From the Bottom &gt; McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters  &gt; Bathtub Gin -&gt; Cities &gt; Sparkle &gt; Split Open and Melt

SET 2: Down with Disease[1], Ya Mar  -&gt; Prince Caspian  &gt; Maze[1] -&gt; Shafty[2] -&gt; Possum[1] -&gt; Jam  -&gt; Cavern[3]

ENCORE: Bold As Love

[1] Unfinished.
[2] Debut.
[3] Slow, funky version with original lyrics.
This show included the debut of Shafty, which was then briefly teased by Mike and Trey in Possum. Disease, Maze, and Possum were unfinished. The funky jam in between Possum and Cavern featured some stage banter from Trey about the funk jams the band had been playing. Accordingly, Cavern was played in a slower, funkier manner than usual and included some of the older, alternate lyrics. This show is available as an archival release on LivePhish.com.

----

Personally, I feel like this show is a great show to just represent where the band was in 98. Overall still very funky but starting to get into that spacey and ambient zone of 98/99.  

YEM is extra funky as was the usual at this time, McGrupp gets taken for a trip, and Gin and SOAM are also both great jams. Very solid first set. 

DWD has a nice hose jam and the band just kinda rides it for 10 min, but the major jam worth mentioning is the thick-funkified-porno-cavern which is a fun way to finish off the Island Tour.

I was one of the fortunate few who got to walk about 22 miles or so to get to Coventry.  It was sunny, it was long, it was tired, but it was kind of fun.  I remember walking along the highway for a long time and then getting off at the exit, following that road a ways and then coming across a dude selling a fanmade poster.  It was specifically a ""Mound"" poster.  The main subject was the old man, there was an hour glass representing time.  I purchased that poster immediately and stared at it that night, but in the end it never made it off that campground.  There was a lot of reasons *cough* why I may have thought this was THE GREATEST THING IVE EVER SEEN!!!!! but I do really remember it being super well done and really really great.

Holy. Fuck.

That was one of the best sets I've ever seen. That shit felt more like an epic poem or opera or something than a rock band. The way they build tension and energy is incredible, and they tease so hard instead of just letting loose immediately. They're full of mischievous little musical tricks. You can never know what to expect. These guys go from feeling like 1930s French jazz to death metal in 30 seconds, and make it work beautifully. If you get a chance to see these guys, you're absolutely robbing yourself if you don't.

In a way, they redefined for me what's musically possible. I post here because I felt something like I imagine early phish fans felt.

Next Level Wook Flu from Dicks,"Howdy, 

I wanted to share this story as I have never caught a true ‚Äúwook flu‚Äù until this past dicks run. In fact, I rarely ever get sick besides a minor head cold maybe once a year or so.

Anyways lets get to the main event!

Sunday set break on the floor I was sitting with my buddies. A beach ball flies in, bounces off the floor and scrapes directly against my eye ball. It kinda creeped me out and I made a joke about pink eye‚Ä¶..Whatever, I'm spun its all in my head.

Sure enough 3 days later I started coming down with‚Ä¶.pink eye. My mucus was also taking a turn for the worse. Went to doctors, got some eye drops for them. 

Around Sunday I started feeling weak, foggy and dizzy. Began getting cold sweats and I imagine I had a fever. Whatever, it happens. Just trudge through. Eat healthy and sleep.

Monday night I start developing a wicked painful throat issue. I am confident as of today, that it has to be strep (looked online, same bacteria causes both)  I can not swallow without unbearable pain and my mucus is dark yellow or bloody.


Folks WOOK FLU IS NO JOKE! I always kind of mocked it, but this goes to show you freak incidents can wookify any healthy immune system. Seriously, what are the odds?

Whelp thats all, wanted to share this with whoever may find it interesting.

Until next run!

Sugar Shack: The Intervention,"Hi, Trey. I want to preface this by saying that we aren't attacking you. This is coming from a place of love, however harsh it may seem. Trey, we need to talk about your problems with Sugar Shack. We all know it's gotten out of hand. Back in '09, we were all excited to have a new groovey Mike song on Joy. All the elements for a live monster were there. Odd timing but still a danceable groove? Check. Page synthiness? Check. Strange funny lyrics? Check. Great guitar melody and solo potential? Check??? Fast forward to 2017, and look at the state of you. You played the song 3 times this year and the versions range from ""meh"" to ""unlistenably bad"" . The last objectively good version I can think of was in san fran in summer '16 (correct me if I'm wrong on that one). We love you Trey, and we love Sugar Shack. But you've made me not love it. You've made me hope that the song doesn't get played. Think of the people you're hurting (please, won't someone think of the Gordo?!). I hope this little chat has made you see that all we want is for you to make us love the song again. We have faith Trey, but do you?

JamBase interview with Mike,"Hopefully this lays those silly hiatus rumors to rest
https://www.jambase.com/article/going-ogogo-mike-gordon-talks-new-album-upcoming-tour-phish



JamBase: On that note, after putting out Big Boat and playing the Baker‚Äôs Dozen, which by all gauges seems to be a massive success, and no Fall Tour for Phish, it feels like the end of a cycle. Other bands will put out an album, tour on it and then go off the road for a bit. Does it feel like the end of a cycle for you for Phish or the start of a new one?


MG: Well, Phish runs itself so well ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt mean without people because there are people ‚Äì but a lot of times I just don‚Äôt have to think about it. All year and last year I‚Äôve been working on my album as the main thing long before the Baker‚Äôs Dozen. It‚Äôs kinda like there are other people to make decisions. I bring some songs to Phish and I bring myself and my soul. From day-to-day, even if I‚Äôm on the road with Phish, I might be doing a little bit of plotting and scheming for my own projects. I don‚Äôt think of it one way or the other, I appreciate having this extra time to really get out there and, like you said, do a slightly longer tour with my band and follow through with album stuff. I‚Äôm really thankful that I have my time.


JamBase: Has Phish learned from the past in terms of the hiatus and the breakup where you‚Äôll play when you feel like playing instead of needing to have defined huge breaks?


MG: Yeah, I don‚Äôt think it has to be defined as a breakup or hiatus, I mean maybe there would be a hiatus, but I think we‚Äôve kind of figured out it gives us the enjoyment and the musical challenge that we need if we let it breathe and don‚Äôt try to overdo it. It‚Äôs just a matter of allowing it some breathing space so it can come back and be rejuvenated. I mean, we can do more and we can do less and it would be fine either way, but just kind of monitoring it like ‚ÄúOK, let‚Äôs take a break‚Äù and that works fine.",phish,1505407580,GamehendgeBrewingCo,9,11,True,2017-09-14

"""Down with Disease"" - Spin Doctors connection?","Here's something I've wondered about for a long time. Was ""Down with Disease"" partly inspired by the Spin Doctors musically? I know some of you may laugh at that, or at the Spin Doctors in general, but remember that early on they had many ties like touring together on the original HORDE and going back to the 80s Trey and Chris Barron had the same guitar teacher. I also came across this interesting post looking for information about ""Down with Disease"" [that says](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-band-Phish-never-gain-mainstream-recognition) Trey said the Spin Doctors were crushing it every night early on, playing different setlists and jamming and such until Two Princes came out and people started coming to the shows just to hear that song and it ruined their live show for them.

Since the '90s I've been reminded of the Spin Doctors when I hear ""Down with Disease,"" especially the studio version. EDIT - Not the lyrics. The music, especially during the verse.

Need Help With Phish Just Jams Playlist,"So, this is a pretty unusual request - I need to create an entire playlist that has NO WORDS. So, I figure Phish Just Jams is the way to go. Let me explain:

My brother is a Mormon missionary (don't ask me why), and isn't allowed to listen to any music that has words (or watch TV, use social media, call home, etc.). He's been out doing his thing for 8 months now (of 24 total), and is starting to go crazy with not listening to any music. They're allowed to listen to Mormon church music (gag) and non offensive instrumentals (they specifically prohibit hip-hop/rap instrumentals).

So, here's the task - I need recommendations of ""classic"" Phish jams that can tell a story even without the words; music that is interesting and unique and definitive but also definitive and not just noise. Examples that jump to mind are the Tahoe Tweezer, Vegas Golden Age, and Long Boy. I need some help filling this out. Thanks, owe you a beer!",phish,1505759049,goldenageretriever,9,2,True,2017-09-18

Down With Disease Sandwiches,"With all the DwD discussions this past week, I've been bingeing on all the jams we discussed. What a week!

After re-listening to the BD Disease sandwich, I remembered my buddy asking me at Nutter Center if I thought they'd do a DwD sandwich. ""No way,"" I said. ""They don't really do that anymore."" Clearly I was wrong.

I hit up Phish.net's performances tab and exported the data into a pivot table. Here's what I found:

Down with Disease was debuted on 12/31/93 which was 955 shows ago. It has been played at 267 shows for a total of 277 times. So it has only been sandwiched 10 times:

Phish keeps getting raises and I don't!,"I went to Dick's this year and spent too much money on official merch. I'm trying to save money now to get a house with gf and kids (3).

I got home and went to get my mp3 on, and I can't even upgrade my code to mp3 download. $27 for the MP3s. Tried a support ticket to see about wangling a discount after all the money I spent (a little North of $200 on official merch, not counting lot stuff here -- hoodie for me, shirts for kids and gf and me, and a hat). I was told that streaming is what it is now, and I didn't mind paying parking (ackchyually, I took shared rides for $) or venue beer prices (only bought lot beers for $) so what's $27 for MP3s? No sympathy. K, fine.

Now MSG prices are up ~15% over last year.

Furthermore, every webcast I've purchased via LivePhish has had major connectivity issues. I'm cancelling my LivePhish+ subscription because the app still blows despite constant feedback with every update.

Unpopular Opinion...,"I don't particularly care for the Jam Filled show from BD. I was there. I went to Red Velvet (Sunday 7.23) --„Äã Jam Filled (Tuesday 7.25) --„Äã&amp; Powdered (Wednesday 7.26). Don't get me wrong, I was at a great Phish show and loved it as always. But even out of those three shows, it was my least favorite.

There are two main reasons this show left me salty.

1) The nearby crowd. The entire row behind me was nothing but drunk, stoned chompers. Nonstop. Loud-talking and spilling beers. My wife and I left our decent seats for the 300s during My Friend My Friend. The newfound space was a relief, and the sound was still ok, but even up there we encountered a group of cocaine clowns who were oblivious to other people's space.

These gripes are not inherently tied to the band or this particular performance, but environment is crucial, and unfortunately this environment was validating for people who dis the band because of the scene. 

2) More importantly, but of course still subjective: Length of a jam does not automatically mean the jam is epic. Sure, it was really fun when we all realized that Sample was taking off. And Lawn Boy, of course. Sure. Duh. So much fun. But personally, I'd rather have a seven minute jam with hose and direction than 30 minutes of jamming for jamming's sake. 

Rant over. Just my opinion as a middle aged fan. Overall, I think BD will go down as one of the most awesome feats in the band's history.

"OK, I'm sorry, but you are all friends... Please read.","If you go back maybe 5 or 6 years, you'll realize that I made the first ""Setlist thread"". Reddit archives are good for something. I know I entertained everyone with my sleepiness, but just understand that something I created has been taken over by a bunch of people who want to be in the spotlight on a website where privacy is at a premium. 

Just know this:

1. Swisspassport started the setlist thread. No denying. Go back and find the first one. It was me.

2. I feel that this r/ has been taken over by 3.0 people who really never saw the band in their prime. 

3. I don't give a damn about #1 or #2, I just want people to know, you can shit on me all you want; downvote me to hell, but understand, you wouldn't have these show recaps if it wasn't for me.

4. So, no mea culpa, no sorries, whoever is on the ""spreadsheet"" to do the next show, realize it's getting old, and kinda lame. 

5. As a ""jaded vet"" I think Reddit could do better than this. Doling out roles as to who can do a setlist thread... give me a break.

I know I messed up a few times. If you were at a show and your friend was falling out, would you help him/her? Or would you just make fun of them and shun them from your crew? It's so easy on the internet to tell someone they're in a bad spot, and say fuck off, then downvote, but if I was at a show with you, would you behave the same way?

"I like Phish, lol","Just wanted to share how I came to be a Phish fan. I thought it was kind of funny. My friend of 25+ years is a giant Phish fan and has been for as long as I can remember. I have made fun of him constantly for it. Relentlessly, mercilessly. A few months before BD he posted something on Facebook looking for people who would be down to sneak packages of tortillas into MSG to start a tortilla war as folks did in Boise in '99. I never see this dude since we don't live close to each other, and he's a very good friend, so I said I was down. I spent a the months between then and BD listening up, learning their stuff, listening and watching a ton of live stuff, and ended up liking most of what I heard. We went on night 6. We scratched the tortilla idea, but when Divided Sky came on, I was completely sold. It was a religious experience for me. I'd consider myself obsessed at this point and am counting down the days until their NYE run (I live in the NYC area, I am very fortunate). My only fear is that they're going to break up at some point (I know they have before) sooner than everyone would imagine which will leave me having missed so many amazing shows. I guess what I mean is, I wish I opened my ears sooner. I'm REALLY picky with music, and Phish is truly therapeutic to me. Every song has its own personality and character. So weird. I was the biggest hater. LOL",phish,1506457053,bitb0y,8,8,True,2017-09-26

Thoughts on Nashville,"First of all, one of the coolest musical experiences I've had. Many thanks to all the cool Phans I met there, and to Trey and the symphony for making it happen. I had moderate expectations going in that were totally blown away just by the end of the first set. Some thoughts:

-CK5 really mailed it in on this one, huh?  
-Never thought I'd see so many donut ties in one place.    
-A refresher course on etiquette would have been helpful for everyone's listening experience. Obviously it's a different crowd than your standard orchestral arrangement, but you have a large group of professional musicians up there who are trying to stay precisely in time without the help of in-ear monitors, and having the audience shouting an wooing throughout the performance is a major drag. Trey addressed this, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, after Divided Sky, saying ""For those of you who don't know that last tune, *one* of those times when everyone was yelling is kind of part of the song. So... good job everyone"".    
-I don't know what pedals (or lack thereof) Trey was using to get some of his tones during First Tube and What's The Use?, but I've never heard them come out of the Languedoc before.
-The one appropriate moment of crowd noise: Stash claps, and they've never been more on point.    
-Time Turns Elastic should only be played with an orchestra.    
-The downtempo turn at the end of YEM was a welcome surprise, though, crowd noise again was an issue.    
-I kept waiting for a 58-person rotation jam that just never seemed to materialize.

18 Years of Seeing Phish - A Brief Reflection,"I never would have thought I would be seeing this band 18 years after my first show at the Pyramid in Memphis, TN. I was 15, impressionable and a little off kilter for my age. I felt like I was a little on the fringe of the social groups at my school. I was fun and funny, but a little too goofy to be cool and a little too ambitious to be comfortable being a loser.

That was my first time eating mushrooms and it was a memorable time. I remember watching a group of people throwing orange glowsticks during the 2001 and I was convinced someone was throwing flaming torches.

Saw them a few more times and once I was allowed and able to make it on tour, all decisions I made in my life were to support my addiction to the band. From 2003-2004 I saw the majority of my shows at the time, doing two and three week runs at a time. I got jobs and quit jobs just to support the the party. It was fun, I found my tribe, and I felt like myself more than I ever had in my life. We all know the feeling. 

When the scene started to turn a little darker, when Trey was getting down too hard, and shows began to suffer greatly- I began feeling a little out of place again. After waiting 40 hours in traffic for Coventry and getting in to the abortion that was that event, I washed my hands of the band. Whether or not they came back, I was not going to be part of it. All the subsequent events afterwards just sullied my image of what I thought was important to me. I started to question whether I was just fucked up the whole time and whether or not the whole thing was a fueled sham.

I felt a little bit taken. I thought back to the shows I loved, where they were hitting on all cylinders and I was unsure whether they held the importance I put on them. I gave away my collection and I stopped caring all together about the band. 

They came back in 2009 and I went, just because it was in my hometown. It was fine. I just realized I had lost the zeal. I thought maybe I could get it back, but it was gone. 

I saw a couple more shows, here and there, a show a year, just to catch up with old friends, always leaving the show as if I had just hung out with an old girlfriend I didn't much like anymore. 

I found the love of my life and often times would reminisce on some of the times on tour. While it was very short, it was during my formative years. I always wished I could have shared that moment with my now wife, but I knew it would never happen again. 

Fast forward to 2015 and I get talked into going to Magnaball. I noticed that a lot of the people at the show had gotten older. Their kids were there, I ran into a few old friends, ran into Mike and chatted with him. Had a great experience with my wife and could feel it bubbling up again. She could tell it meant a lot to me. This was the first time she could actually see it. 

After the Tweezer Caspian, something burned in my heart. It was back, full throttle. I remembered all the great shows, and I remembered they WERE transcendent. There was no sham. There were good times and bad. It wasn't all just a party that ended too soon. It was something special. Something just as special as I remembered it. 

I was sure I'd never take my wife on the road to multiple shows to where she could actually experience those events that happen when you follow a band around. Well since 2015 we've traveled the country as much as we could. 25-odd shows after Magnaball and we are both hooked. Me again, and her for the first time and I got it back. There was something that was missing for a long time and I got it back and the band gave it back to me. While I saw some great, weird, dark shows- I am happier seeing them now than I have ever been and take each show with gratitude, because they could have been done a long time ago. So that's all. 

Thanks gang.

I just listened to 2.0 in its entirety. Let's talk about it.,"I had listened to a number of these shows previously, but I finally decided to listen to every 2.0 show in order. Overall, my feelings towards it are as follows: LOTS of diamonds in the rough, setlist creativity was seriously lacking &amp; 1st sets were often much better than 2nds. My personal favorite moments were: 2-14-03 Gin+WOTC, 2-20-03 Pebbles, 2-22-03 WOTC, 2-24-03 Entire 1st set, 2-28-03 Entire SHOW (duh), 7-13-03 Seven Below!!!!!, 7-15-03 Mr. Completely Fest!!!, 7-22-03 Entire 2nd set, All of IT!, 12-28-03 Frankie Says, Brooklyn Moma-&gt;Free, All of SPAC 04, Hampton 04 Entire 1st set!!! (Best WOTC ever, IMO.), .... and then there's Coventry... honestly, I don't find it that terrible to listen to. The 1st set on day 1 was actually great. Drowned &amp; Split Open and Melt are both top notch jams. Won't necessarily be reaching for these 2 shows regularly, but the highlights are pretty strong nonetheless. 

So what do you guys all think of this era? It's probably still my least favorite of them all, but I certainly have a newfound respect for some of its finer moments.

"My reflection on my 25 years of seeing Phish, inspired by /u/BrockAtWork","So, here's my story, if you care to read.

My sister is 7 years older than me. She had a boyfriend who moved to NC from NY in 1990, and they hit it off. When I was hanging out with them, he would talk about this band ""Phish"" because he knew I was into the Grateful Dead. After a few months, he produced a tape of one set of music, and I was laughing at him. I thought it sucked, compared to GD. I can't, for the life of me, remember which show it was from.

However, I was intrigued, and interested in hearing more. At that time, I was all about the Dead. No one could top them, or even come close. Little did I know...

Slowly, more tapes began to arrive, and I became hooked. I saw my first 2 shows in 92'. The band was fun, and raw. We thought that these guys were awesome musicians, and hilarious at the same time. Never, at first, did we take them as a serious band that would become something big. Never did we think this small Vermont band would become anything more than what they were: ""an awesome bar band, that jammed, and were funny"".

Over the course of the next few years, I saw more and more shows. I loved it. Tickets were cheap, the crowd was small, the shows weren't crawling with police, and we began to think we were getting in on the ground level of something that no one else knew about. Still, we had no idea of just how big it would become.

Skip ahead many years, and me and my friends went on tour. Jerry had passed, and the scene started changing dramatically. Not for better, or worse, just changing. SO many more people at shows now. It was sort of strange. It had, up until to this point, been a fairly small community. You hear the word ""family"" a lot these days. It doesn't mean what it used to. In the mid 90's we were all family at Phish shows. No one was a stranger. No one caused issues or violence. No one was judgemental. We took care of strangers, like they were best friends. This has changed now.

Sincere touring continues: Myself, and 3 friends did the entire 96', 97' and 98' tours. Every show, fall, spring, and winter, minus Europe. We saw it all. This is, in my opinion, the absolute peak for the band. We all had jobs, but but quit working when tour started. We only had tickets for a few shows each tour, but never failed to make it in.

After each show, we would scour the lawn (if summer), or the floor (if winter) and collect everything that was dropped. We had nowhere to be, and most folks were scurrying to get home, so we stayed finding stuff until they made us leave. If you haven't done it before, you would be AMAZED at what people drop, and leave at a show. This included, at that time, tons of pot, gel tabs, and paper hits. After that, we would sell what we had found to finance the next few shows. We would use that money to buy soda and beer to sell in the lot. (and for you young folks, it's IN lot, not ON lot"". We wanted to get rid of the drugs we weren't keeping and taking ASAP, so we couldn't be busted for what we were selling.

This was tour in the mid to late 90's. No biggie. No planning, just run with it. We made it into every show, including the West Valley Utah DSOTM show, where it felt it like a club show again. So few people. No one checking tickets to ensure you weren't on the floor with uppers. We picked up a couple of Phish tour hitch hikers after this show, and they were absolutely terrible. Another story...

Skip ahead another few years, and Big Cypress is coming up. Me and my crew, minus one (RIP JB) made the trip. We had already attended the Clifford Ball, Great Went, Lemonwheel and Oswego. However, we were not prepared for the majesty, that was to come.

Big Cypress was unlike any other festival the band had put on. Sure, lots of people, but this one was different. Tons of people were there. We were all (jokingly, but not sure) worried about the Y2K thing, and thought ""nowhere is safer to be that night, than in the middle of nowhere, in the Everglade swamps""! Traffic getting in was brutal. Getting out? Another story...

The strangest thing about Big Cypress was the lack of drugs. Everyone was so petrified of carrying anything down I-95, due to the hype of the show, that people were struggling to find anything, if they didn't bring (a small amount) for themselves.

We settled into our camping spot, and made our way to the concert field. Everything and everyone was electric. Listened to soundcheck. Could only imagine what we were in store for.

We were, luckily enough, able to attend the last 8 shows of 99' winter tour. The boys were on fire, but it didn't matter if they completely dropped the ball one night. We knew Big Cypress was coming.

Big Cypress was incredible. Everything I could have hoped for. Many people were pissed about the hotdog float schtick again, but I loved it. It cruised right past us.

Anyway, first set at Big Cypress, we were late to the concert field. We did the ""dick move"" of fighting our way through 80k folks to find a spot near the front. We sat down, and awaited the show. I'm from North Carolina, and the group we sat down behind was from Indiana. One of the ladies in that group is now my wife. Been married for 12 years. Crazy. Met her at Big Cypress, out of all those people. Who would have thought? 2 kids now, and as in love as the day we met. Thanks, Phish!

Rambling. Trying to move on.

SO, my then GF, but now wife, and I saw as many shows as we could through the next few years. Being that she's from Indiana, we had a great place to stay with her parents during that epic, 3 night summer run at Deer Creek, in 2000.

We saw as many shows as we could, until the dreadful ""hiatus"". Once that was over, and they announced their return, we had everyone we knew submit ticket requests for the MSG and Hampton shows. Luckily, we were able to get tickets to all 4 shows. Was a god send.

We were so fucking pumped to be in the Garden that night, witnessing history. But after the whole run, we were saddened, and troubled by what we heard. I expected the boys to come back full steam. They didn't. This began the era of Trey's slipping, and bad performances.

Yikes. This is getting way too long. Down vote if you feel the need.

After this, we saw as many shows as we could afford to. We even saw 4 shows the first year of our first child's birth. After that, it's been shows when we could find a sitter, and so forth.

Now, at 42, it's strange to go to shows. The band is back, and are playing, this year, amazingly. The crowd today is very different though, which is to be expected. It's just, to me, the crowd is VERY different. Fights in the lot. Nitrous. etc.

Anyway, I have totally forgotten what the person, who inspired me to post this, said. These are just my thoughts, from an old vet, trying to relate. I hope you enjoyed reading it.",phish,1506733083,Alumni-Blues,10,17,True,2017-09-29

"Phish/GD, or more, lyrics that have to be short you would add to tattoo? More inside!","Hey guys,


So I'm getting a beautiful stunning profile profile of a women Native American warrior on my upper arm. I was talking to the artist and was thinking about possibly adding a quote and they will definitely do it! The quote would go in one if the mannnny feathers. It'd be barely noticeable to anyone but it means something to me. The tattoo drawing itself is beautiful.

I came up with a bunch of quotes, keep in mind I want 1 sentence and he's just going to freehand it. I don't want it perfect I kind of want it scribbled on there. He said take I can take it in until the day of it's not a big deal. Here are my quotes, one thing, I want it to be somewhat happy. I don't want to be reminded daily about the shitty love stories that went sour or negative thinking. I want to feel good when I read it. Thanks everyone! 

Oh ya, all bands recommended. I'm familiar with a large amount but only spent 40 min on this list with my favorites.

Some quotes; (trying to keep it light, but with my favorite artists)

I also love (besides Phish and GD)  Pink Floyd who has major significance because I tripped listening to dark side for the first time...mind blowing, Hendrix, Eric beck, stones, Beatles, Clapton/cream, talking heads, John Frusciante (not so much RCHP for a quote, just John), I do like Nirvana but I feel like the quote will be a downer, String cheese Incident, Neil young and the Crosby stills my Nash aka mostly Neil, 

Ps. Fuck Billy Joel.

As said before, I want the quote to just not be depressive as it's on my body forever.

Hendrix: Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Grateful Dead: Ain't nobody messing with you, but you 
Grateful Dead: don't tell me this town ain't got no heart 
Dead, again: All you gotta do is smile, smile, smile 
Dead: Inspiration, moving me brightly 
Dead: just keep on truckin
Phish: Set the gearshift for the high gear of your soul 
Phish: (the trick was to) surrender to the flow
Phish: I'm sharing in the groove
Phish: the moment ends though I feel winds
Pink Floyd: Breath, Breath in the air. Don't be afraid to care
Skynard: Boy don't worry. You'll find yourself. Follow your heart and nothing else
Skynard: Free as a bird (can we fit a tiny V bird?)

I'm leaning towards the Dead: Ain't nobody messing with you, but you. Because I love Althea and that everything I hear thar quote i say that's so Fucking right.
Or
Dead: Inspiration, move me brightly.  Or, Let my inspiration flow
Course the Hendrix one
I honestly love all of them in their own way. What do you guys think?! Thanks! 

Additions:
Phish - Take care of your shoes
- besides the fact that you should. I need to remind myself daily. Otherwise I come home jumping in puddles and rolling in mud on my way (and back) to kill Wilson! Dam lizards are dirty as fuck
GDead - there is a road, no simple highway
GDead - talk about your plenty, talk about your ills, one man gathers what another man kills 
GDead - The trouble with you is the trouble with me, got two good eyes, but you still don't see
GDead - Whistle through your teeth and spit 'cause it's alright (from touch of grey, I think the ""dog has not been fed in years, line is better but I don't want a starving dog line on my am)
GDead - Daddy made whiskey and he made it well, cost two dollars and burned like hell. Gotta love brown eyed girl
- I think I really like the talking heads quotes. Everyday people would understand it.
Talking Heads - Lost my shape, trying to act casual
Talking heads - Feet on the ground, head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong (really fucking like this one)
Talking heads - And you may ask yourself, well
How did I get here? 
Talking heads - Same as it ever was 
Phish- If you can heal the symptoms, but not affect the cause, it's quite a bit like trying to heal a gunshot wound with gauze.
Phish: can't this wait 'til i'm old? can't i live while i'm young""
Phish - And silence contagious in moments like these
Consume me and strengthen my will to appease
Phish - cause we've got it simple, cause we've got s band
Phish - please me have no regrets
Phish - I struggled with destiny op on the ledge and gasped when defeated when defeated when he clipped on the edge 

Please add some more quotes with bands you love! I haven't done too much research.

Edit: do you guys wanna make this interesting??? Let's all upvote a quote that we like, cannot be Fucking ""such a bag of dicks"". I have to approve of the quote and add it to my list. We'll take a vote and I will get that quote. Pics guaranteed when I get the tattoo!

P.S. I'm going to a Grateful Dead dream catch look a like on my back by my new tattoo or snuggled in next to it. This I can get within a week. The guy in working with now could take 1.5 more months, we have an appt but he tends to move people up.

Best live ‚ÄòRound Room‚Äô album tracks??,"Phish has been my favorite thing since I started playing music - when I was 10 (17 years ago) - since then, I‚Äôve caught a dozen of their shows, and have logged many listening hours to the live shows. 

The first studio album that made me fall in love with them was Round Room. The first time I heard it was like a storm door swung open in my heart. Especially as a studio effort, I think the boys did an exceptional job of translating their live experience to a ‚Äòprivate‚Äô setting. 

I believe the reverse is true as well: these songs translate so well live! I have never heard a ‚ÄòSeven Below‚Äô or ‚ÄòWalls of the Cave‚Äô that didn‚Äôt end up being a highlight of the particular set they were placed in. 

That being said, I feel like some of the other tracks from Round Room are gloriously underplayed.  I‚Äôm wondering perhaps if y‚Äôall can point out some of your favorite instances where tracks from Round Room got the proper live treatment.

Phish Recommended Songs,"Hey everybody! I hope people will take the time to read a boring old text post amidst all the other great content in this subreddit.  
  
For anyone who is active in the Grateful Dead community, you may or may not recognize me as the creator of the Grateful Grabber chrome extension for the live music archive. That project has been a great success with almost 4,000 weekly users (It makes me so happy to see that number rise), and so it inspired me to create some software for the phish community (as I love phish so very dearly).  
  
I am currently a Senior in Undergrad and I was already planning on creating a crossplatform desktop app to stream all the phish shows from phish.in. I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone and use this as my ""Senior Capstone Project"", which my professor seemed to like the idea of although he recommended that I implement some algorithmic complexity to the app, which leads me to the main purpose of this app: A recommendation system that suggests songs or shows based on your current preferences (most listened to tracks and most liked tracks by the community)  
  
I'm sure many of you already use the site http://phish.in, although I am not sure how many of you actually have an account for the site and methodically click the little 'heart' button next to shows or tracks. This is an extremely important feature in my project, and so I was hoping to raise a bit of awareness to get a bit more involved in the liking process through phish.in.  
  
A quick overview of how I will be implementing a recommendation system algorithm is as follows: We will run an audio analysis tool for every single track in the phish.in repository. By classifying certain attributes of the raw audio files, such as bpm, tempo, the pitch frequencies, and many more, we will be able to cluster groups of songs together based on how similar they sound. A simple example of this would be that most of the bluegrassy tunes (Old home place, blue and lonesome, etc) would end up in cluster A whereas the more funky tunes (Moma, BEK, Think fall 97 incarnate) would end up in cluster B. This is extremely simplified, but after implementing the algorithm I am hoping that we can get into the nitty gritty of the jams and start clustering jams together (I don't have any solid examples of this off the top of my head, but think a carini jam that really goes somewhere and then a DWD jam that happens to sound similar to that carini jam).  
  
Ultimately that will be the base of our clustering algorithm, and the liked tracks/how many times all users have listened to a song/how many times you as the user have listened to that track will weigh into how we choose a song to recommend from that cluster of tracks.  
  
Overall I guess after writing all of this there is no real concrete point to this post, other than to gauge the interest of the community on if this kind of recommendation tool might be interesting or not. Additionally to see how many users may find it cool to have a standalone desktop app (on both PC and Mac) to pop open and stream their favorite shows from.  
  
Hope to get some meaningful feedback down in the comment, and feel free to ask any questions/give some suggestions if you feel like you have a good idea. (One example of a suggestion I personally have for myself is maybe running a text analysis tools on the comments from phish.net to classify how an overall show may feel to the user, eg. This show was packed with funk, thus those songs will be weighted towards the funk group).  
  
  
Additionally, I don't have much of a musical background and I know there are a bunch of savants out there (/u/Wforwumbo and /u/thegreatjatsby) who may have some advice on what and how to specify certain pieces of audio that I may not be aware of.

- Are these different from the ""taper"" seats? Would my tickets specifically say ""taper"" if that's what they are?

Rules:

* To qualify, you must have at least 25 posts on reddit or at least 5 posts in /r/phish as of the posting of this OP. 
* Each user is allowed 1 guess for the first 30 minutes; after that, guess as much as you like. 
* For me to consider your response, it MUST have both a date and song. 
* For me to consider your response, you must either reply directly to this OP, or to one of my comments in your comment chain - I use my inbox to identify responses. 
* After 1 hour, if nobody has guessed the jam correctly, I will post a hint
* After 3 hours, if nobody has guessed the jam correctly, I will start over with a new jam.

You Can Never Stop the Couch Tour - Live Type II Jams Streaming Weekly,"tl;dr - Live Improvised jams streaming every Thursday at 8:30 pm Central, from a rotating cast of Chicago area musicians doing an hour of completely imaginary music for imaginative people. Also coming soon to a weekly podcast version. [FB](http://facebook.com/SunDeceivers) [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpZw8Xj5Yqg2X4s1_AirY7A) EDIT: That includes tonight! 

Hey you damn beautiful souls, it's been a while since I've checked in with you guys and now that the BD has finally sailed off into the dark caverns of our pasts and we've been upgrading our living room groove stations I figured now was the perfect time to share! Since I first posted to anyone who would listen and wanted to be a part of the experience, The Sun Deceivers have grown from an idea into a weekly live broadcast featuring a rotating selection of excellent musicians. Each week we get together and throw down a full hour (with a small break) of completely improvised Type-II jams. Each night is different - some are high energy and explosive, some are low key and floating. It just depends on who's playing and what they're feeling in that moment.

It's been a couple of months now, and we've started to have a nice catalogue of back episodes and each episode gets added to the archive after transmission so you can always check back in if you can't make it live.

Anyway, this has become a wall of text so I'll wrap it up. The Sun Deceivers are streaming fully improvised jams live weekly on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpZw8Xj5Yqg2X4s1_AirY7A). Come share a moment, come share our energy. Do stuff on all the socials. Our family is where I feel safe, so I came here first.

Lets make something cool, lets make a new community. Lets make stuff up.

Fun story for dog lovers and Phish geeks (BD content),"A little over a month ago my girlfriend and I decided that we wanted to get a dog.  I've always been a dog person and grew up with them, but most of my adult life I lived in apartments and did a lot of moving for work so it just wasn't in the cards.  My girlfriend has always been a cat person and has never had one before so she was a bit more tentative at first.  But now we have a house with a great fenced in backyard and she was actually the one to suggest why don't we just do it, what better time than now.  This made me just about as happy as I could be.  She still talks about the face I made when she suggested we get one.  

So the hunt for a dog was officially on.  We already had big plans to do the last 5 nights of the Baker's Dozen, so we knew we couldn't get one until after we were back.  But by this point we were both so excited we couldn't help ourselves to start the search.  I'm very partial to Labrador Retrievers as that's what my family always had growing up and I think they make such sweet house pets.  But the more we got into searching the more set my girlfriend got on getting a Golden Retriever.  They are beautiful dogs and have temperaments very similar to a lab, so I really had no issue with this.  

We started doing some emailing and eventually found an available female Golden Retriever puppy.  We took off to go visit her as soon as we could and immediately fell in love.  She was perfect.  The only problem was she was going to be ready to go home in a couple weeks but we wouldn't be able to get her until later than that after Baker's Dozen was over.  Fortunately the owner didn't mind keeping her for a little while longer until we were back from our Phishcation (I think we actually said we were spending a week in NYC with friends and seeing some shows... so still true!).  So that was officially settled, we had our puppy.  

Next was deciding on a name.  There were a handful of different names we both liked; some more than others.  At first I wasn't real big on the idea of doing a Phish related name, but I also wasn't opposed to it.  Eventually we did get it down to between Piper and Izabella (she would go by Izzy).  After all the only reason the two of us even met in the first place is because of Phish.  We met on okcupid after I saw her very compatible profile that also talked a lot about seeing Phish.  Our first date was actually in Vegas before the 2014 Halloween show.   

Somewhere along the line we did start leaning towards Piper, but for whatever reason I just couldn't rule out Izabella.  So I came up with the idea that if Phish busted out Izabella in the last 5 shows of the BD that would be her name; otherwise, it'd be Piper.  Obviously this was extremely unlikely to happen and we prepared for our new dog that would be called Piper.  But as you are reading this now, you already know how this story ends.  

We were planning on picking up the puppy the day after the BD was over on the way home from the run.  So we had to do all of our homework and shopping before leaving for the run to make sure we were ready.  I even got this sweet dog tag made to go along with her new collar and leash.

[Piper!](http://imgur.com/YmAWnnx)

We watched most of the webcasts of the first 8 nights and were selfishly hoping that they'd manage to save Piper for the last 5.  So when the Red Velvet show was announced it seemed like that would not happen as Piper felt like a given to fit the theme.  Not that it would be that big of a deal, we've both seen the song live plenty of times.  But as the twists and turns of this run went it never showed up making us feel better about our odds.  

Now the real interesting donut in regards to this story was Night 8.  The last show before we headed to the Garden... Jimmies!  They still hadn't played Piper yet at this point and it actually seemed to put the nail in the coffin on any hope they'd bustout Izabella at our shows.  If there was ever a night where an Izabella bustout was somewhat likely, this was it.  If they didn't play it that night, which they didn't (GREAT show though), then they probably never would again.  

Now it was our turn to experience this legendary Phish run.  What would be a cool way to celebrate our new Golden Retriever puppy named Piper?  How about the 2nd set of our first show opening with Golden Age and then getting our sought after PIPER in that very same set!  Pretty damn cool, and had us stoked as hell.  So that was it, it was all but almost settled.  Rage these last four nights of incredible Phish and then we'd go get our own Piper.  

A couple times we did say 'well, what if... ', 'haha yeah right, never happening'.  And really by the last day I don't think we even mentioned Izabella once.  It was far out of our radar at this point and we were just anticipating how Phish could possibly end this historical run and were excited to pick up our Golden Piper after it was over.  

In an epic personal stat fashion for me, they opened the show with Dogs Stole Things.  My first time ever seeing it live (124 shows).  Pretty damn cool, but everyone knows what else went down that final first set.  When Trey went into the riff I was in complete denial that this was actually happening (No... fucking... WAY).  My girlfriend and I just looked at each other with our jaws on the floor.  And with that, just a mere 18 hours before picking her up, Phish had changed the name of our new dog.

Baker's Dozen 35mm,"[Baker's Dozen 35mm](https://flickr.com/photos/140009453@N04/sets/72157684017400242)

Hey Everyone,

Here is an album of film photography I took while attending all 13 shows of the Baker's Dozen. There are photos of the scene around the venue, from the shows themselves, BD-related activities like Danny Clinch's pop-up at Sonos and Rene Huemer's work on display at Morrison Hotel, and finally street photography from my time between shows.

I used a Leica MP and 35mm Summicron. A few times I shot with a 50 summicron and 28 elmarit. The films stocks I used were HP5, delta 3200, triX, portra 400, portra 800, cinestill 800 and Natura 1600.

Baker's Dozen was the best musical experience of my life. I spent time with family, best friends, some of my favorite photographers and mentors, and made tons of new friends. I celebrated 4 years sober on Jam-filled night, and Jimmies night was my 50th show. I had the incredible opportunity of meeting the WWII photographer Tony Vacarro, who was in DDay. He shot WWII , post war reconstruction and went on to shoot fashion and lifestyle. He was very humble and he astonishing stories. I also went to a free Cory Henry show in Brooklyn, saw Christian Scott at the blue note, spent a day at Coney Island, and much more. I am so grateful for the entire experience.

I'm excited to share these photos with this great community!",phish,1502504299,TwentySeventh,36,133,True,2017-08-11

Guys...I cannot stop listening to set 2 from maple night.,"I am so in love with this set. And I don't know who else to express this to, other than you lovely folks. 

I can listen to swept away>steep on repeat all day long and not get sick of it. The leaves prior to that is definitely killer too. And then the 46 days piper possum 1-2-3 punch. Melted faces everywhere. The golden age to start was really good, but still somehow the lowlight of that particular set for me. With that said, that entire set is essential listening. 

I wish my brain could be erased and I could go back in time to july 14th around 5pm, so I could relive this whole tour. I needed this in my life.

Edit: it just occurred to me that leaves may have been written specifically with this show in mind. They played it sometime in the first 5 shows as well. I feel like to was to make sure it was polished for this show. Think about it. It's a new song, BD was on the horizon. I bet they were already talking about the setlists a long time ago, and decided to write a few fitting tunes. Golden age leaves Swept steep. It flows so fucking well. Almost too well ;)

Does anyone find themselves changing their minds / loving certain jams after listening several times?,"Just a thought I had. I went to 6 bakers dozen shows but I haven't really given any a true relisten except for the jam-filled show. I'm kind of nervous to do so (also the livephish app sucks) because I don't want to take away from the magic of it. 

But when I listen to certain jams over and over because they are always in my Spotify or iPhone rotation, I become in love with them. Ore example is the Theme -> Cities from NYE in Miami 2014. That combo is engraved in my brain at this point. Even though when I was at the show and I don't even remember anything else from the show. 

I'm rambling now, but I'm just worried the BD shows won't live up to how amazing they were when I experienced them. When I relisten to them, I'll have to spin the best jams over and over again. This will take some time ;)

"My take on The Baker's Dozen (ranked by merits, and discussions on each show)","Ranking the Baker‚Äôs Dozen is an inevitable in the fan-base. I‚Äôve seen many ‚Äúwhat are your favorite show?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat is your favorite jam?‚Äù posts, but having been at all 13 shows, I wanted to offer some highly subjective and opinionated perspective on all 13 nights. I‚Äôve included some commentary to demonstrate my reasoning behind my rankings, as well as general notes and commentary on the shows. Also, please note these are MY personal subjective opinions; you are welcome to disagree with me, and please share your thoughts in the comments - I actually welcome the discussion of conflicting opinions, and will upvote per reddiquette accordingly!

A quick note, to fully inform you of where my opinions come from‚Ä¶ there are LOTS of bustouts this run, and lots of them are really cool. But when I was at the run, I found myself more often than naught thinking ‚Äúhmm yup I was there the last x times they played this‚Äù and that doesn‚Äôt devalue the bustout nor how it was performed, but it does subjectively influence my opinion of the show. That‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt get excited at bustouts, and it‚Äôs not to say that I didn‚Äôt LOVE getting some tunes for the first time. I‚Äôll try to identify these moments in my notes if I speak negatively about a bustout, and try to dissociate my lack of enthusiasm from something you may have thought was amazing or a blessing to witness. Again, keep in mind - these are **JUST MY OPINIONS** and I am in no way asking you to accept these as hard fact. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. I just want to start a dialogue and discussion, as well as offer my perspective of the run, especially since I imagine not many got to witness all 13. 

I noticed an odd pattern in the run starting night 5‚Ä¶ almost every single show had an extraneous song in the second set. Why they put it there, I don‚Äôt know, and removing the song from the second set would make it overall much stronger. In many cases, I feel putting said extra song in the encore would significantly improve the show; in other cases, I felt the extraneous song just killed set energy and should be excised for another night‚Äôs set 1. But Phish played what they wanted to, and I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt fault them for that. I‚Äôll include my commentary on this with each night‚Äôs breakdown. 

To counterbalance this, I will also include what in my opinion were the stand out jams for each night in additional commentary below this nitpicking. 

For those of you careful enough to read this post in its entirety, I wanted to drop you this little update, regarding my matrices of this run. I WILL be doing more than just the jam-filled I have posted, I‚Äôm just waiting on some of the tapes I want to use to get uploaded. I do NOT think I‚Äôll have time to do every single show, so I am currently planning on doing the cream of the crop from shows - noted below each show as the standout jams. The jams in parentheses are jams I am on the fence about matrixing, if I have the time and energy (again, keep in mind I‚Äôm a few months away from completing a doctorate) I will get around to matrixing those jams, and eventually I will release the entire thing as a massive compilation. If you want to see me matrix jams or songs I haven‚Äôt listed, or think the parentheses are truly deserving of the matrix, please comment or PM me and I‚Äôll take it into consideration. 

And now, without further ado, here are my thoughts and rankings of the Baker‚Äôs Dozen. 


**WforWumbo‚Äôs Ranked Baker‚Äôs Dozen**


13\. *7/22 Strawberry*: Right off the bat, you know this run is special when what was in my opinion ‚Äúthe worst show of the run‚Äù still contains a nearly-20 minute Disease that really goes deep, a masterful set 1 Moma > Breath and Burning, a Foam bustout that was executed VERY cleanly, a Roggae that absolutely brought the house down, a gorgeous Squirming Coil to close the first set, a brilliant cover of Strawberry Letter 23 (complete with a short but spacey dive into the deep end), a Disease reprise, and one of the best encores of the run. But what may not have translated on the webcasts was the general severe drop in energy and dis-intrest from the crowd, inside the venue. There was LOADS of chatter from most of the audience in the venue - in my opinion, this show was the worst offender for talking during jams in the run. Maybe it‚Äôs a function of fewer people there to actually witness the music being in attendance (instead attending for the spectacle and bragging rights of ‚Äúbeing at a Phish show‚Äù) given that it‚Äôs the first Saturday show, but I also think the fluidity - or lack thereof - of the setlists is to blame. And also, love or hate them, there IS a marimba lumina jam, which in my opinion TOTALLY killed the energy they had building up in set 2. You can see it in Mike - he just can‚Äôt respond to Trey or Fish, they‚Äôre off on their own trip, and Page is also totally ignored by both of them. They follow it up with a bustout that just comes across as sleepy, and the Disease reprise just seems to me like a cheap attempt at unsuccessfully trying to bring back some momentum they had lost. You may have been there and been in the pit or lower-100s, or this was the only show of the run you got to catch, and you may think it was a phenomenal show - I wouldn‚Äôt fault you by any means. I certianly credit the Disease, encore, second-set cover, and slew of rather strong first-set jams. Overall, this really isn‚Äôt a terrible show, on paper or on tape - taken out of context of 2017, this show is a SERIOUS heater in pretty much any other year or tour of 3.0. But one show‚Äôs gotta take the bottom spot, and IMO this one‚Äôs it. 

Extraneous song: Shine a Light. It just doesn‚Äôt need to be here, the Disease endcap would have been a plenty fine way to send us to encore, and there‚Äôs time to kick off the already-strong encore with it. 

Standout jams: Mama Dance > Breath and Burning, (Roggae), Down with Disease, (Down with Disease reprise)


*Note: I‚Äôve got a two-way tie for 11th place here; both shows are again pretty solid - again, to show how strong this run is, both shows tied for 11th are still particularly strong Phish shows on their own merits. But when it comes to the rest of the run, these to me are a clear cut below the rest. Again, I have to highlight - I‚Äôm NOT saying these are bad shows. But when I decided to compile this list, this is where the chips fell in relation to the others.*

11\. *7/28 Double Chocolate*: Chocolate rain was lots of fun and clearly both the band and audience had lots of fun. Chalkdust was a monstrosity and peaked VERY nicely and cleanly. You Sexy Thing -> Mercury is, in my opinion, one of the strongest jams of the run. And a Fee bust out in the encore?! But outside of Sand, I thought the rest of this show fell pretty flat. Set 1 was rather low-energy (and not the mellow, quiet low-energy where the band makes you a melted puddle). Destiny Unbound had many clamoring for the bathroom line, and this Divided Sky is one of the most uninspired Divided Skys I‚Äôve ever seen (though the audience roar before the quiet section is one of the loudest I‚Äôve ever seen) - the outro jam seemed like they were just going through the motions. Sand was a GREAT way to prepare people for the incoming set 2 jamming, but it was a bit abbreviated and didn‚Äôt go as far as I would have liked to seen. Set 2‚Äôs opener of Have Mercy might have been a bit stronger had Backwards Down The Number Line not totally killed the jamming out of Mercury, and Rock & Roll seems more like a victory lap than anything. And yes, the Fee encore was a nice treat, but Space Oddity just seemed extraneous (although, I‚Äôve seen WAY too many Space Odditys - I‚Äôm in the 50% club for it) and many in the building were acting like it was the first time the band had ever done a cappella Space Oddity. Great for them - a yawn for me. 

Extraneous song: #Line. It killed the jamming energy of CDT through Mercury. Stick it in set 1 another night. 

Standout jams: Chalkdust Torture, You Sexy Thing > Mercury -> You Sexy Thing


11\. *8/1 Maple*: O Canada opener was phenomenal - seriously, they took all the right liberties with it - I LOVE the univibe on Trey‚Äôs guitar here, in a pseudo-nod to Hendrix‚Äôs Star Spangled Banner. The Swept Away -> Steep is on my list of jams of the run; McGrupp is my favorite Gamehendge tune, so I‚Äôm happy to see it; LxL and Walk Away were high-energy, Golden Age was monstrous (though not at the level of my personal fav Golden Ages - 10/20/13 and 8/4/15), and Rock n‚Äô Roll Suicide was a nice treat in the encore. But both on paper and in person, the rest of the show is tired. Sugar Shack was - as expected - pretty heavily butchered, and Crowd Control through The Wedge were super low-energy. 46 Days gets the marimba treatment - by now you know my opinion of it - and Piper is sadly too abbreviated. Oh, and this is entirely personal, but I really don‚Äôt like 3.0 Possum, especially not in the second set. 

Extraneous song: Possum, though I fully understand it was high-energy, many loved it, and one could argue that it does kinda belong in this set to close things out on a high note. But on paper and in jamming, excise it and the show is much stronger. 

Standout jams: (Golden Age), Swept Away > Steep


10\. *8/5 Boston Cream*: This one‚Äôs placement so low on the list REALLY highlights just how strong this run is; both on paper and on tape, this is still an incredibly strong show. The Ghost is definitely everything to write home about - well-constructed, peaking multiple times, and just a joyous celebratory bit of music. Set 1‚Äôs packed with bustouts (many of which I‚Äôve seen before): Sloth, FYF, Soul Shakedown Party, Fire, Plasma, Frost, even Alaska (which contrary to many opinions I enjoy quite a bit) was well played. All of these are strong set 1 offerings. But set 2 is tired: Petrichor (of which I‚Äôm also in the 50% club for) is too long to be a landing pad but too short to be a fully realized jam vehicle right now; Light doesn‚Äôt get the treatment it deserves, and it feels to me like they kinda mailed it in from Horse onwards. I‚Äôll give credit where it‚Äôs due: Lizards is played well, and Sunshine of your Feeling was an absolute BLAST (not to mention, it really is the origin of this whole gag, no?). But the show is best summarized by a text from a friend of mine who also attended the show, after the encore: ‚Äú$500 is what tickets were going for. That was a $500 Joy.‚Äù Although, I should mention‚Ä¶ I originally had a 3-way tie for 10th, and while writing up this list I reflected and realized this show deserved a cut above the other two, now tied for 11th. 

Extraneous song: Rocky Top. Put it in the encore after Joy to send us out on a high note. 

Standout jams: (Sunshine of your Feeling), (Plasma), Ghost, (Light)


09\. *7/29 Cinnamon*: This is where the list got really hard to start compiling. Ordering the meat-and-potatoes of this run was a tough task. But this Cinnamon show, despite its lower ranking, shows a marked jump in top-to-bottom quality and jamming above the shows below it. To begin with, we have the nice ‚ÄúDO NOT EAT THE BROWN DONUTS‚Äù Woodstock reference pre-show, a nice nod to historical rock events of years past. Opening with an absolutely ferocious Llama - whose return to fast form I gladly welcome and enjoy - with that energy carrying through on Wilson, STFTFP, and Ya Mar - all four openers just start to get a little out there. This is one thing I look for in strong shows - set 1 not necessarily going off the rails (at this age they gotta save something in the tank or else they tend to burn out in set 2), but giving us massive variety in songs that otherwise stay a bit constrained. Especially at the top of the show, it also shows nice fluidity, and that they‚Äôve settled in to the run and the venue at this point. The remainder of set 1 is up-and-down in energy, but overall executed well, finishing on a massive high note with I Am The Walrus. Set 2 is jammed almost perfectly, with landing pads spaced out nicely and the stellar Alumni Blues -> Letter to Jimmy Page bust out bringing flub-free energy. The Blaze On is the big jam of the night, though the 20YL also gets weird and shows its strength building on Chicago‚Äôs offering as a potential massive jam vehicle going forth. Hood peaks nicely, and Meatstick is almost always fun - not to mention this one gets weird and space funky towards the end. Oh yeah - and Cinnamon Girl encore, well-played and a fitting tribute to Neil Young. 

Extraneous song: Dirt. This is the first show where I‚Äôll argue there really isn‚Äôt an extraneous song, and it functions nicely as a landing pad; but if you excise Dirt I think this second set is a perfect 10, and the 20YL already served as an earlier landing pad. 

Standout jams: (Wilson > Stealing Time From The Faulty Plan > Ya Mar), Blaze On ( > 20 Years Later), (Meatstick)


08\. *7/21 Coconut*: Opening night, lots of energy and excitement. The vibe and energy in the air was palpable, not to mention there was this overall feeling of ‚Äúwe have NO idea what they‚Äôre gonna do, the sky‚Äôs really the limit‚Äù after the five pre-run shows. The fan base descended on MSG and you could tell from the get-go this would be different: lots of fingers in the air out front, people traveling from ALL OVER to witness this historic event, Ben & Jerry‚Äôs out front, people-watching and making new friends also there to join me in witnessing this show, poster lines - I remember thinking as I approached MSG before the show ‚Äúit‚Äôs nice to be back ‚Äòon tour‚Äô again‚Ä¶‚Äù. Reba and Moonage Daydream stand out in set 1, and almost all of set 2 has near-perfect fluidity and strong jamming. The Tweezer > -7 is strong on its own - another standout of the run, plus a deep Everything‚Äôs Right (a tune I am learning to look forward to as of this tour), plus a Slave that as usual does not fail to deliver. Set 1 has its tired parts (Pigtail) and WOTC is a song I personally don‚Äôt enjoy getting live (yes I like WOTC overall as a song, but I‚Äôve yet to see a version in 3.0 that differs from any other version, and I get it WAY too much). Mango (I‚Äôve seen the last four) and GTBT are a nice way to send us home with a smile on our faces and leave us begging for the rest of the run to come sooner. 

Extraneous song: Either Billy Breathes OR Sparkle. Despite it being played very tightly, I feel the same way about Sparkle in 3.0 as I do about WOTC, plus I get it WAY too much and I‚Äôve seen it derail set 2 energy (which it thankfully didn‚Äôt do here). But only one of these songs needs to exist here as a landing pad. 

Standout jams: Tweezer ( > Seven Below), Everything‚Äôs Right, (Slave to the Traffic Light)


07\. *8/6 Glazed*: Bookending the run, this one shoots above night 1 based on the pure emotion of this show. The band pulled it off, and it didn‚Äôt really all hit me until I walked outside the venue and realized it was all over. I wasn‚Äôt a wreck like some of my friends were, but yeah it hit me. Set 1 is a bit of a roller coaster itself, with Trey butchering Rift and immediately following it up with an almost self-aware Ha Ha Ha. Camel Walk is a personal favorite set 1 tune, and both Crazy Sometimes and Most Events Aren‚Äôt Planned had my brain on the floor. Bug is nice (though I was looking forward to its placement as a set 2 landing pad), I Been Around was a nice bustout (was at the last one in 2014, and it had a similar effect here), and Izabella had me going NUTS as I grew up cutting my teeth on a VHS copy of Hendrix Live at Woodstock. And I haven‚Äôt even touched set 2 yet‚Ä¶ Simple was brilliant, Starman is the Ziggy Stardust tune I‚Äôve been waiting to see live, and YEM is always YEM. I won‚Äôt even mention the encore, as it‚Äôs been discussed ad-nauseum. 

Extraneous song: Loving Cup. Seriously, move it to the encore. 

Standout Jams: (Most Events Aren‚Äôt Planned), (Izabella), Simple, (On The Road Again), (Tweezer Reprise)


*A two-way tie for fifth. I really couldn‚Äôt pick one of these over the other. Both - from memory, on playback from tape, and on paper - have their merits, and if I had to pick one over the other it‚Äôd be a real coin-toss.*

05\. *8/4 Lemon*: PYITE was very clean, strong First Tube. But this show EXISTS for the second set. Dem Bones is the extranous tune, otherwise this is straight non-stop and cohesive jamming. NMINML was massive and funky, Everything In Its Right Place shot a jolt of energy through the crowd, WTU? obviously has a special place in my heart, Scents was funky and a bit abbreviated for my tastes but still very strong, Caspian peaks SUPER hard, and Fluffhead is the well-deserved and tightly-executed victory lap - the cherry on top of this set. Oh, and the Frankenstein encore had that super cool pulsating single-chord drone to distinguish itself from other Frankensteins. 

Extraneous song: Dem Bones

Standout jams: (Punch You In The Eye), No Men In No Man‚Äôs Land > Everything In Its Right Place, What‚Äôs The Use > Scents and Subtle Sounds > Prince Caspian


05\. *7/23 Red Velvet*: Witnessing this show was ethereal, especially so early in the run. When they pulled off this show, I honestly walked out thinking ‚Äújeez, it‚Äôs only the first weekend. The sky really is the limit for them right now.‚Äù Sunday Morning was the Phishiest way possible to open the show, How Many People Are You? got the jamming treatment it deserved, It‚Äôs Ice (need I say too much about this one? It‚Äôs a beast harkening back to 1.0 versions), and Wolfman‚Äôs through Waves elevated me to another plane - and I was sober. Sweet Jane was a great send-home tune too, I‚Äôve been chasing that one for a while now and it bookmarked the show and first weekend well. The only criticisms I can find about this show, are 1. I wanted Bag to return to its former late-1.0 glory as a jam vehicle, and while it was well-played here sadly it didn‚Äôt get walked; and 2. Boogie On was JUST starting to grow legs and SERIOUSLY go for a walk, before sadly being antipasto‚Äôd for Wading. I get that they wanted to do the gag, but seriously - just walk Boogie On and put Wading in the first set or encore (though in the encore we then probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten Sweet Jane‚Ä¶). 

Extraneous song: Wading in the Velvet Sea

Standout jams: How Many People Are You?, (It‚Äôs Ice), Wolfman‚Äôs Brother > Twist > Waves


04\. *7/30 Jimmies*: NOW we (and the shows) are seriously cooking. It‚Äôs nice to see such a well-oiled machine pull this off with masterful execution. They NAILED curtain with. Jim I am torn on because it‚Äôs a great way to get people grooving and always consistenlty gets happy, but like Bag I wanted to see it return to its former 1.0-status glory; but I will rarely complain about Runaway Jim. Esther, Brian and Robert, and Forbin -> Mockingbird bust outs, and a well-played Bowie round out set 1. The only criticism I can find with set 1 (and, for the most part, the show) is Home, but given that it‚Äôs set 1 and they still played it well I won‚Äôt criticize too harshly. Set 2 is all meat, little fluff. Drowned through 2001 is as good as it looks on paper, both Drowned and ASIHTOS deserve to be in talks for jam of the run and combine for nearly 40 minutes of jamming - not stats you see for two songs in 3.0 that much. Golgi is the nicely-played and well-deserved victory lap on the show, and Wind Cries Mary is nice in the encore slot. 

Extraneous song: In The Good Old Summer Time. Seriously, excise it and you have another perfect 10 of a set. I‚Äôd argue that without Good Old Summer Time, this second set would be in talks for set of the run. Move it to the encore or to set 1, and this show jumps up significantly. I know many of you are probably getting sick of me for complaining about getting more Phish songs‚Ä¶ but these are my tastes. I‚Äôm not saying it shouldn‚Äôt be in this show, just not in the second set. 

Standout jams: Drowned > A Song I Heard The Ocean Sing, (2001)


*And now, we have the top 3. These shows really ARE a cut above the rest, overall some of the best Phish I have ever witnessed.*

03\. *7/26 Powdered*: I‚Äôve been a big Fleet Foxes fan for some time now, and especially being in the taper‚Äôs section recording this show I was happy to inform all of my fellow tapers about this cover which I should note was performed pretty solidly given all of the a cappella that happened at this run. CTB is a nice tune to get people grooving; The Very Long Fuse is one of my two favorite Chilling Thrilling songs so I was happy to see it (I view it as a mellower and slightly funkier Split Open And Melt); Gumbo was strong, and Pebbles and Marbles is probably my personal favorite bustout of the run. But then, we get to the real body of this show, and it starts at the end of set 1: Tube. Wow. Just wow. I was speechless. THIS is a jammed out Tube, and it peaks SO nicely. From here on out we are treated to one special jam after another: Carini. Mr. Completely. 1999 -> Jam. Steam. All of them executed masterfully and truly going to exploratory and experimental places that only Phish can take us to. I will also admit, this show had the absolutely impossible task of following night 4, and they still managed to pull a true heater out of their bag of tricks. No Quarter was a great and spacey way to round out all the jamming, and the Powderfinger was expected at this point but still welcome. The only criticism I have is Ch Zero seems like a cheaper version of their victory lap, but I‚Äôll admit it still did some cool stuff and I got to groove to it. 

Extraneous song: Character Zero, though I‚Äôll admit this second set can‚Äôt end on No Quarter. Perhaps swap it with Tube, given that Tube gets the same jammed-out treatment? Or maybe Powderfinger, and leave Ch. Zed as the send-us-home-with-a-smile-on-our-faces tune? Again this is starting to really split hairs and nitpick, which is a very nice change of pace for criticizing Phish in my opinion. 

Standout jams: Tube, Carini -> Mr. Completely > 1999 -> Jam -> Steam


02\. *8/2 Holes*: Very little filler, and even when it‚Äôs there it‚Äôs used as a much-needed and well-earned breather. Executed perfectly from top-to-bottom. I was surprised that many didn‚Äôt know Way Down in the Hole (I‚Äôm a fan of The Wire and was able to pick it out immediately); and Buried Alive was fiery. KDF and Guyute kept the energy going, and I Didn‚Äôt know was Phishy antics at their Phishiest - let‚Äôs face it, that‚Äôs one reason we go to lots of shows. NICU was played well and got things grooving again, Meat was **thicc**^TM and funky, Maze peaked hard and strong, Ginseng through Heavy Things was mellow and patient, and Antelope just flat-out raged in true set 1 Antelope style. But the set 2 is just about as close to pure perfection as Phish could get for a set 2, and for that matter a show as a whole. Mike‚Äôs -> O Holy Night competes for my favorite jam of the run, it peaks well and hard - not to mention, the gag was tied in wonderfully and in a rarity for the run contributed to the jamming. It was spacey and ethereal, truly unreal. Taste is VERY strong, Wingsuit is strong (contrary to many, I LOVE Wingsuit and feel it‚Äôs an appropriate landing pad here, allowing Phish to get their Pink Floyd on), Sally > Groove is fantastic. 

Extraneous song: for the first and only time, I really don‚Äôt think there is one. If I had to pick ONE, I‚Äôd say Sally, as it‚Äôs the only song that didn‚Äôt really get the jammed-out treatment, but I‚Äôm not going to complain at all about it being here. This is really a fantastic set top-to-bottom, and I think could arguably be the best set of the run. 

Standout jams: (Run Like An Antelope), Mike‚Äôs Song -> O Holy Night > Taste, (Sneaking Sally Through The Alley -> Weekapaug Grove)


01\. *7/25 Jam-Filled*: You kinda had to know this was coming. From top-to-bottom, this show is just‚Ä¶ unreal. I remember during set break telling some of my friends that I was witnessing possibly the best Phish show I would ever see. I also made the effort to at the beginning of the first song of the evening turn off my phone (as it was blowing up with texts from friends), and just tuning out EVERYTHING aside from the music in this show - thankfully this show rewarded me for doing so. In my book, you can put this show in its entirety up against ANY show going back to Big Cypress (yes, I DO know the catalog pretty well), and it will win. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs still there, but I think this show does deserve a firm seat as second-best-of-all-time (sorry, Cypress‚Äôs Project Sunrise will never be toppled unless they try it again) in the Phish canon. And I‚Äôm about as jaded as the vets still following this band come. 

I gotta say, I think there were a number of factors outside the music that also contributed to this show‚Äôs status firmly in the 1 seat. Firstly: very-little-to-no audience chatter. I think that, especially being a midweek show and also being so early in the run, this show was mostly attended by Phish‚Äôs die-hard fans. I was hesitant as to how blocking off the back portion of the undersold venue would fare, but I remember thinking after this show (and the next night‚Äôs Powdered donut) thinking ‚Äúif that‚Äôs what it takes for Phish to play this way, can they PLEASE never sell the back of the venue?‚Äù It‚Äôs classic Phish to make people regret not going to the undersold shows (see: 11/2/98 - and the fact we can discuss these two shows in the same sentence shows just how strong Jam-Filled really is!). I think there was a bit of pre-meditation into constructing this show which ruins the allure a bit, but the strenght of jamming all-around quickly makes me forget that nitpick. I also went in with ZERO expectations after red velvet night; in my comment history for this show‚Äôs setlist thread, I commented on my way to the venue that I would trust the band could do just about anything and they‚Äôd pull it off well - and this show delivers that, in spades. 

Now let‚Äôs start from the top, shall we?

Sample: it was incredible, once the jam starts you can hear the audience go ELECTRIC, though I‚Äôll admit the tapes just don‚Äôt hold the same energy. It really was special, and the band rewarded the roar of approval from the audience with some tasty, tasty jamming. Just like the Roggae from Strawberry night, the audience was pin-drop silent outside of the necessary roar of approval when jams peaked. 

Lawn Boy: Normally, like many other tunes I‚Äôve mentioned here, Lawn Boy is one of the songs that gets a groan from me as it just never does anything particularly special, feels kinda lazy, and gets the chatters chatting quite heavily. I‚Äôve been told ‚Äúthis song is not meant for you‚Äù which really is true (especially as a jam chaser). Well, tonight proved that 100% wrong, and now Lawn Boy will forever have a special place in my heart. From the get-go with Page bringing out the keytar, and at the first left-turn we knew something sepcial was about to happen especially given the theme of the evening. People around me were clamoring the now-famous ‚ÄúIs this still Lawn Boy?!‚Äù line throughout the jam, and the peaks are extremely celebratory and not just the ‚Äúlazy peaking‚Äù argument I gave about much of 2016 Phish - a theme of this run. 

My Friend, My Friend: Well, how the hell do you follow up that Lawn Boy? With this nice gem. Gets just weird enough to not be fully type 1 towards the end, but doesn‚Äôt have the depth or length to be a monstro-wait, this is still set 1?! And this song is still not standard?! It‚Äôs gonna be a VERY special night‚Ä¶

Stash: Jeez, are they gonna give us ANYTHING to criticize in this show? This stash flirts with - but never ends up - breaking free from its constraints. Lots of chromatic interplay between Mike, Page, and Trey; and Fishman is as usual his machine-like self, pounding away at those skins like there‚Äôs no tomorrow and keeping us locked in to SOME semblance of reality while we get slungshot over the moon. 

Bathtub Gin: Type 1, but super frickin‚Äô happy type 1. Gin is my favorite jam vehicle thanks to those millennial late ‚Äò90s versions, and while this one doesn‚Äôt compare to those or some of the numerous 3.0 monstrosities we‚Äôve been getting recently, it‚Äôs a solid way to end-cap a FIVE SONG JAMMED-OUT FIRST SET. I can‚Äôt stress that enough. I guess they gotta save something for the second set‚Ä¶

Fuego: Seems they‚Äôre not here to fuck around tonight. While not the monstrosity of Lawn Boy or the incoming Crosseyed, it still holds its own especially on replaying this tape. I was mildly hopeful given the theme that this version would be enough to dethrone 7/4/14 as the best Fuego, but seriously given this entire show I‚Äôm not gonna split hairs. 

Thread: Ever since hearing this tune from Chicago I‚Äôve been wondering just how they execute it, and the answer is I still don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs clearly well-rehearsed, complex Phish that‚Äôs got odd time signatures when its tonal and totally jazzy and off the deep end when it‚Äôs atonal. Lots of complex composition, this is a very mature Phish. I wish they wrote more stuff like this in the modern era rather than the dad-rock-centric ‚Äúsizable maritime vessel‚Ä¶‚Äù. Either way, in my book it has a happy and accepted place in the canon of this show and Phish‚Äôs catalog. 

Crosseyed: Wow. Just wow. All-around, possibly the strongest jam of the run. Well-constructed, multiple passages that are all cohesive on their own, strengthened by equally-cohesive transitions between passages. A floaty ambient spacey dive into the deep-end in the middle section, bookended by two very celebratory, fluid, and happy segments on either side, each with multiple peaks. I (along with the rest of the venue) was VERY in to this jam. 

Makisupa: We need a cool down, right? NOPE! Time to start going off the rails deep in to the jam. Fun keywords and interplay during composed portions, and the outdo gets super spacey, dropping us in to‚Ä¶

End of Session: Well. One of my favorite Phish songs, gets its premier in my favorite Phish show I‚Äôve attended. Perfect placement, ethereal and spacey. Gives us a chance to catch our breath and also take stock of where the hell we‚Äôve ended up in this show. 

Tuesday: The only nitpick I have of this show. I‚Äôll leave it at that and expand below, because I really won‚Äôt complain too much with a show like this. 

Cavern: Perfect way to cap off this set, tightly-played and clearly they‚Äôre having a blast. 

Julius -> Lawn Boy reprise: See my comments re Cavern, and the Lawn Boy reprise just serves to reinforce that Lawn Boy and this show truly are jam-filled. 

Extraneous song: Tuesday. I get why they put it here, and yeah they‚Äôre just having fun. But it kinda temporarily broke the wall of perfection they had built up to that point, and excising it makes this show a perfect 10 all around. That said, they did recover from it without missing a beat, and the show is still strong with it in there; not to mention, they DID need a landing pad of SOME sort outside of the complex and intricate Thread (which I don‚Äôt think serves its full job as a landing pad, and which is also why I find Thread that much more impressive in this show; I AM looking forward to Thread‚Äôs outro getting seriously jammed‚Ä¶). 

Standout jams: The entire thing, really‚Ä¶ save for Tuesday. 

Well, that about wraps it up. Feel free to respond or comment on my thoughts below, let‚Äôs start a discussion. ",phish,1502650951,Wforwumbo,70,98,True,2017-08-13
I think 8/1 2nd set is one of my favorite Phish Sets in just under 80 shows.,"8/1 is not pretty on paper, and the 1st set was lacking energy, imo. 

I'm usually all about the dark dance funk shows -- high energy with darkness and tension -- yet this contemplative mostly ambient 2nd set blew my mind(I was sober), and is a contender for my personal top 5 shows attended.

If you have not, give the 2nd set a listen, start to finish.  (The start of Leaves is a bit of a lull in song 2, but the ambient Jam sets the tone for the rest of the set.  and a 3-4min Marimba/drum jam is 46 days is a fun live antic, but also a bit of a lull, imo)

This is one of the rare shows that had 4th quarter jamming that was as explorative as the 3rd quarter. The song lengths are all sub 15min, so the Jams on paper may seem uninteresting outside the 20min GA, which ironically was the least interesting of the major Jams imo. 

In particular Golden Age, Swept Away, Piper were all top shelf jams.  Leaves is slow but the ambient Jam set the stage for the rest of the set, that built ambient energy culminating in Possum explosion.  46 days is a solid jam, though derailed by the Lumina antivs,  Possum is an insane peak to close it. 

Possum, I generally feel is just a fun set 1 tune, preferably opener or closer --- but that Possum was an unreal peak and cap to what I thought was an nearly perfect 2nd set.  46 Days was a good Jam, and at the show, the drum and Lumina games are fun and a brief pause from the intense Type 2 jamming that started with Golden Age and never really let up. (though Lumina sections are musically shit, and not great for relisten, a brief 3-5 min one doesn't bother me cuz its fun live in small doses -- if they stay there for 8-10min...let alone 15-20min, I'd be upset.)

Hi everyone, 

/u/gello1313 was kind enough to donate 5 ticket codes to the cause of this little project I have running here! The first of 5 codes, for 7/14/17, can be yours if you can correctly guess the **date AND song** that [this jam](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bww-Eb_RgGepOEFWZWU3NEZUZlU) is from. 

Edit: Congratulations to /u/forbininthedungeon for correctly identifying the 7/20/13 Weekapaug Groove! Stay posted for a few more codes tomorrow sporadically throughout the day. 

**CLUE:** Oh my gosh, didn't realize how much time had passed! Sorry on the delay of this clue... in exchange for my tardiness I'll give y'all until 1 AM EST to figure this one out. The clue is: look to a north(erly) direction

Here are the rules:

* To qualify, you must have at least 25 posts on reddit or at least 5 posts in /r/phish as of the posting of this OP. 
* Each user is allowed 1 guess for the first 30 minutes; after that, guess as much as you like.

Here are some of my all-time favorite Phish sets...what are yours?,"I've been having some fun over the past several weeks re-exploring some of my all-time favorite Phish sets (not shows) with my girlfriend. I was lucky to have been at a lot of the all-time 90s shows, literally lucky (flight getting cancelled made me say fuck it and going to the Dark Side show in 98), and introducing her to these shows has been a fun rewind. Here are the SETS (not full shows) that I think deserve to be in the talks of best sets theyve ever played. Cypress and Great Went are my top 2 all-time, the rest aren't in any particular order. Keep in mind there are *so* many good sets that have been done, many here wont be listed, so don't flay me if I didn't list something. Also note that I'm only including shows that have been played since I started seeing Phish, which was Spring Tour 1994.

- 12/31/99 Set 2 (obvious reasons)
- Great Went Night 2 Set 2 (my favorite non-cypress set; every single jam in that set is an all-time version of the respective song, truly must-listen stuff, not to mention the first glowstick war ever and the burning of the statue we all helped build over the weekend)
- 11/17/97 set 1 (5 song, MONSTER first set)
- 12/30/97 set 2 (killer AC/DC bag, one of the more memorable Harpuas..into a 5 song encore that took us past midnight!)
- 5/7/94 set 2 (the *real* Tweezerfest)
- 12/31/95 set 2 (this show is considered by many to be one of the best full shows that was played in the 90s by any band. I think set 2 is a large part of that)
- 10/31/96 set 2 (my all-time favorite costume, went as elvis that year; a set that set in motion the funk jams that would develop over the following 2 years)
- 11/19/97 set 2 (I'm a sucker for big jams, this one has 2 back to back, one of my favorite 2001s, and a slick, funky 97-style Makisupa)
- 12/31/98 set 1 (possibly my all-time favorite set opener with '1999,' maybe my second favorite next to the Riverport Gin)
- 7/17/98 set 2 (4-song, all-time set includes the longest 2001 ever, a fan-favorite mikes song, and a SPEED FUNK WG.)
- 4/3/98 set 2 (Roses&gt;Jam and one of my favorite Antelopes)
- 4/4/98 set 2 (another monster that's chalk full of improv and rarities)
- 9/14/99 set 2 (peaches opener into one of my all-time favorite duos in AC/DC Bag-&gt;Gumbo that contain an 'another one bites the dust' jam)
- 6/24/2000 set 1 (huge moma to start, and a Tweezer in the middle that to this day remains one of my favorites i've seen live)
- 6/20/04 set 2 (4 song, heavy improv set; what's even more impressive is how incredibly tight this set is - and really both shows at SPAC 2004 were - given how terrible they were playing by the end of 2.0; the disco twist!)
- Honorable mention: 7/26/17 set 2 (though it's obvious that Lawn Boy from the BD is king...overall I was more impressed with the second set the next night. It seemed like every single jam got out there and spacey)
- Honorable Mention: 12/3/97 set 2 (while I don't think this is one of their best sets of all time, it was my 18th birthday, and they came out and played one hell of a jam throwdown...17 min first set drowned, 26 min bowie into a possum&gt;funk jam. This show flies so far under the radar because of it's place next to the giants of fall 1997, but I assure you it's worth the listen!)

Phish in Strange Places,"The other day at the upper-scale-ish restaurant that I work at, the owner, a normally pretty grumpy guy, was looking for something new to put on the radio. He knows I go to see phish pretty regularly but has never listened to them, so he puts on Phish Radio on Pandora. 

What followed was the most entertaining night at work I may have had the pleasure of enjoying. Serving tables while songs like Farmhouse, Squirming Coil, Theme From the Bottom, and a number of Dead, JGB and TAB songs were playing was amazing. Even though most of the Phish stuff was studio, hearing it in that setting was surreal. The penultimate moment was when YEM came on towards the end of the night. I knew once we got to the vocal jam it would all be over, but I enjoyed every second leading up to it. 

But this all made me think, has anyone had any experiences like this worth sharing? I remember reading about people hearing phish on weather channels, more stories like this would be great to read while we're still waiting for dick's.

"I know it's a couple days late, but the 20th anniversary of 8/14/97 cannot go unrecognized","This was the show right before the Great Went and it went great!  The opening trio of Ya Mar, Funky Bitch&gt;Fluffhead gets things going, followed by strong versions of LXL and Free.  I love love love this version of Billy Breathes, great solo by Trey and then they end the 1st set with a hot Antelope.

Second starts with a ripping CDT followed by Love Me for Elvis Week &gt; Sparkle (Elvis loved this song!).  The jam off the end of Hood is great Type II jamming (rumor I heard was that they were trying to play along to a fireworks show at the amusement park this venue is at).  A well executed Forbin's comes out of that and then the madness begins.  Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters came out to tell the tale of trying to get to the Phish show, which included Frankenstein, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz, Bozo and a few others.  When it was all said and done, Trey warned the crowd ""see what happens when you take too much acid 30 years later?"" and then announced that even though they were supposed to go into Mockingbird, that ""the funk is too deep!  We cant stop!!"" which takes them into a fitting Camel Walk followed by a set closing Taste.

Top to bottom, this is GREAT show.  Seek it out, listen and enjoy!

It is also one of the greatest examples of how a jam can blow your mind and move you to tears without crossing the 15 minute mark. Heck this one doesn't even cross the 13 minute mark. 

What makes this jam so great? For starters, there is not a single wasted note. Everything flows perfectly, effortlessly, with amazing interplay among the members. Everyone is absolutely on point the entire way through. Page especially shines. This really wasn't composed!?

Then you have Trey's tone. My goodness. While 11/18/96 Simple may feature my favorite *soaring* Trey tone, Trey's tone throughout this jam is just insane. At times crunchy as can be, at other times smooth as butter. Wow. I particularly love the minute long segment beginning [here](https://youtu.be/sXQl8RAPQBc?t=533), which features some really beautiful plaintive notes and tones from Trey. 

12/31/95 is rightfully one of the canonical Phish shows, but songs like Reba, Mike's (!), Weekapaug (!), YEM, and Runaway Jim often get top billing. But this Drowned... Man.

* To qualify, you must have at least 25 posts on reddit or at least 5 posts in /r/phish as of the posting of this OP.
* Each user is allowed 1 guess for the first 30 minutes; after that, guess as much as you like.

I needed to see some outdoor Phish this year, so I've decided to make my first trip to Denver for Dicks.

SHUT THE FUCK UP AT PHISH SHOWS ALREADY!,"I am going to make a plea for all future Phish shows. If you go to a show PLEASE for the love of everything please SHUT THE FUCK UP. It is getting to the point where I can barely hear them play or sing anymore, and I know I am not alone because I am not the one who made those stickers a few years back. No body is there to hear you chit chatting with your friends. No body is there to hear me or any body else sing along to their songs. We know the songs. We know how they go. Can we maybe hear the band we are paying hard earned dollars to go see sing and play? That would be ridiculously awesome. They are an intimate band.

Tips for Dicks beginner?,"Me and a group of friends are going to dicks and this'll be my first show. I'm super excited for it and my goal is to snag a poster. I've heard they sell out fairly fast and I'm fully prepared to wait in line for  a few hours. My plan is to help set up our campsite with my friends then after we get all settled I go straight for the merch line. I'll bring a book for waiting and some party favors for the show and meet up with my friends after I get through the line.  Hopefully I make a few new friends in line. We'll be there all 3 days so I can explore around as much as I want all weekend so what's a few hours in line for something I really want, ya know? 

Like I said this is my first show so anyone have any tips to make the most out of the weekend or survive the merch line? My friends went to dicks last year before I got as into phish as they are, so they know a bit but I'm interested to hear other opinions and tips.

TIL Phish learned barbershop quartet from Page's landlord,"....and the vocal-blending techniques they learned by doing barbershop influenced their songwriting on *Rift*.

[Source 1](https://books.google.com/books?id=eXD8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q=barbershop&amp;f=false):

&gt; ...Phish apprenticed with a master of barbershop quartet who just happened to be McConnell's landlord. When McConnell said he played in a band, his landlord responded, ""Oh I'm kind of into music myself. I have a barbershop group."" 

&gt; Instead of chuckling to himself, as the average musician might have done, Page saw an opportunity for the band to further expand its horizons. ""He was an international judge for barbershop for about thirty years,"" said McConnell. ""Turned out he was able to give us lessons, and we ordered a bunch of music.""

---

[Source 2](https://www.csmonitor.com/1993/0423/23142.html):

&gt; ""Part of the art of barbershop quartet is blending the sounds,"" McConnell explains. ""I think we're blending better now on all our singing as a result of that.""

&gt; ""I don't think any one of us has the greatest voice,"" Anastasio admits, ""but with barbershop we can blend and make beautiful music.""

&gt; This is quite evident in their latest album titled ""Rift,"" which, in fact, does not include any overt barbershop but shows marked advances in their vocal work over their three earlier albums.",phish,1503609461,matomatomat,15,109,True,2017-08-24

Song suggestions to inspire my Architecture Studio project?,"""The Studio is centered around the theoretical development of a ‚ÄãA New Music School and Performance Center, sited in a significant cultural area of Medellin, Columbia, adjacent to the Plaza Cisneros (Plaza Luz).  We will be exploring designs you create, inspired and informed by a piece of music of your choosing.  As a class, we will work together in assisting each of you in translating your own piece of music into architecture.

In addition, for our first class, you should be thinking about which piece of music you wish to select that will be the basis of your design for the semester; and be prepared to commit to it by the end of class.  Any form/type of music is fine.  Don't be surprised if we play it in class.  :-)  You will live and work with this selection for the entire semester, so choose wisely.""

Ebay possible ticket scam,"So i bid on some floors on ebay for the opening weekend at MSG. I entered a max bid that matched the stub hub lowest price , my thoughts were even if i win at my max bid , i will at least save on the absurd stub hub fees. The tickets were listed individually for each night , with 2min left I was winning with like 60$ to spare from my max bid. I knew there would be some snipers so i expected it to at least get close to my max bid , well it did and i was outbid at the very last second by one increment.

I know , I know, this is ebay and this is how people win items , but it seems phishy and here is why. The tickets both ended with prices higher than the current stub high price , to the point where it would almost be a wash with the fees......but wait there is more...

less than an hour after the auctions end , they both ended within 5min of each other , i got a second chance offer for the same ezxact tickets , both of them , to buy it now at the price of my max bid.

This got me thinking......I highly doubt the buyer for BOTH tickets backed out in less than hour , it was stated you have 24 hours to pay for the item. 

My tinfoil hat theory is that the seller used another account to bid until they won , then backed out. This then gave them the option to offer m,e the tickets at my current max bid when in reality I would have won the tickets for at least 40$ less.

I have 12 hours left to decide on this , what does reddit think? Should i say fuck this person for being shady and pay a few more dollars on stubhub? Should i just suck it up and buy the tickets since i will save a few dollars? 

Anyone think prices will drop ,currently just over 200$ for floor tickets for friday and saturday opening weekend.

Non-Phish fan needs help,"About 9 months ago I tried to get into Phish (the reason I tried so hard is another story that has to do with the tragic death of the biggest Phish fan I have ever met) but I didn't have any luck. All of the songs are just a little too... wacky? I don't know, I'm just not into it.

I listened to several songs and man, it just did nothing for me. One day I looked at my aforementioned friend's facebook page, looking for some form of healing, and noticed that he had posted a video of ""Wading in the Velvet Sea"". It was live so I was pretty luke warm on it, but still I found a recorded version. Holy shit, you guys. It is the best song I have ever heard. I listen to it every day, and every time I listen to it makes me emotional like no other song I have ever heard.

My question for you is: what other songs of theirs might I like? It seems like Wading in the Velvet Sea is not a typical song of theirs. What other songs are like that (meaning a pretty big step away from their normal stuff)?

With other bands I am willing to accept that I only like one of their songs, and I just move on. But Wading in the Velvet Sea is just different. The genius behind it is just absolutely undeniable.

"Last seen at Magnaball, pleae help me find my Mr.T!!","Mr T. Cutout - Please HELP! 

So, many, many years ago, I bought a life size, wooden cutout of Mr T. on my way home from partying all night in Toronto. He went everywhere with me afterwards; two Bonnaroos, Superball, etc, but he got jacked the last night of Superball and was gone. In what I can only describe as kismet, we saw him again at Magnaball and got the story of his life over the missing years. We arranged to pick up up from his Phantastic caretakers on Monday AM as they wanted to return him to his rightful guardian, but we got to their camp too late and they were gone. 


There are several amazing adventures we had together, and I‚Äôd be happy to share them if anyone is interested, but I‚Äôm looking for some help from the Phish community here to track down and contact those who have him and arrange for him to come home. 


The only details I know, is that he‚Äôs been in New Jersey and was living near the shore, as best I can recall. 


I‚Äôve linked a couple of photos of him and I for proof, but does anyone here know where I can find him?? 


Any help is greatly appreciated!

The wildest NYC prediction analysis I've ever seen... (source unknown),"CHECK IT: 

Absolute Zero: What would it take for Phish to perform the entire MSG ""Baker's Dozen"" run without a single repeat?

To get an idea, I looked at some Phish Statistics from the last three years, starting with the MSG 2013 NYE run, and continuing up until their most recent shows this January in Mexico. I also analyzed specific 13-show consecutive runs from the last three summers.

=====

From 12/28/13 to 1/15/17, Phish played 124 shows, performing 2,665 total songs, for an average of 21 songs per night.

During this time, 300 unique songs were performed.¬†98 songs were played were played at least ten times, or once every 12-13 shows. 30 songs were played at least once every five shows.¬†78 were onetimers; 222 songs were performed more than once. Ignoring Auld Lang Syne and Star Spangled Banner, this leaves 220 tubes which we can consider ""currently in rotation.""

In the last three years, 54 songs were debuts, meaning a¬†new song was introduced every 2.25 shows.¬†Since the MSG '13 run and Mexico '17 run included no debuts, the calendar years '14, '15, and '16 can be said to feature an average 18 debuts per annum.¬†

Of these debuts, 18 were covers specific to the occasion, including Is This What You Wanted, Playing In The Band,¬†Samson and Delilah, Take Me Out To The Ballgame, The Ocean, United We Stand, West LA Fadeaway, and the 11 songs from Ziggy Stardust. Additionally, Auld Lang Syne and Star Spangled Banner were both both performed three times, and can be considered to fall into the ad hoc cover category.

Of the 2,665 songs from the period in question,¬†only three are considered ""jams,"" Drive-In Jam (8/22/15), Jam (7/27/14), Tweeprise Jam (12/28/16).

Discarding these 23 ad hoc selections*, the band has 277 songs from the last three years to choose from, 57 of which are onetimers. Additionally, if the band keeps pace with their current debut rate, they could be expected to introduce up to 18 new songs in their MSG run, presumably 2-3 of which would be rolled out during their upper Midwest tour beginning this weekend. (*The GD songs would have the highest likelihood of reprisal, especially in the welcome event of guest appearance from any members of the Dead fam; and, since the band averages one ""jam"" per year, we could expect to see another during this run.)

=====

Looking at runs of 13 consecutive shows from the last three Julys, the band averages 278 total songs and 145 unique songs per each 13-show period. This amounts to about 21 songs per night, in keeping with average of the last three years in total.¬†

From 7/11/14 to 7/30/14, Phish performed 123 unique songs, 45 of which were onetimers.

From 7/21/15 to 8/8/15, the band performed 126 unique songs, 58 of which were onetimers.

From 7/1/16 to 7/22/16, they played 186 unique songs. 106 different songs in this run were played only one time.

During these periods in 2014 and 2015, most songs were played twice. In the 2016 run, most songs happened only once, largely due to the bustouts on 7/20.¬†

For each of these runs, Fuego is (at least tied for) the most-played song, occurring seven, five, and four times, respectively.¬†

If the band were to perform songs at the frequency of 2014, we could except to hear 23 songs played thrice over the Baker's Dozen run. If they perform with the frequency of 2016, there would only be 5 songs performed three times.¬†

=====

Over the 13 nights at MSG,¬†Phish¬†can be expected to perform about 21 songs per night, totaling between 270 and 280 songs over the course of the run.
To do so without any repeats, the band would probably have to include nearly each of the 220 songs currently in rotation. This leaves 50‚Äì60 songs to speculate on.

These songs will draw from a) those played only once over the last three years, b) debuts, either originals or covers, and c) bustouts of the nearly 600 additional songs found in the band's catalogue raisonn√©.¬†
If Phish comes to New York City, and plays 270+ unique songs over the course of 13 shows, this will be the rarest period in the band's existence.

=====¬†

My predictions are:
Of the 220 songs currently in rotation, we hear 216 of these.¬†
Of the 78 songs played only once in the last three years, we will hear 26 of these.

An additional 13 songs will be played from the band's repertoire that have not been heard in the last 124 shows. Chances are a bulk of these will wind up in a single set, i.e. 12/31/13 or 7/20/16.

17 new songs will be performed at MSG, including up to three debuted in the earlier July shows. 11 of the 17 will be part of larger project; the question remains whether these are covers or originals.¬†

The band will play 1 untitled jam.¬†
This totals 273 songs.¬†‚àí273¬∞ C is considered Absolute Zero, the lowest possible theoretic¬†temperature. (Incidentally, 273 is also the number of seconds in John Cage's landmark ""silent"" piece ""4'33""."")¬†

My prediction is that we will see 273 unique songs over the course of the MSG run, achieving ""absolutely zero"" repeats.¬†

=====

In conclusion, below are the songs in heavy rotation, each of which have been played 28 times or more over the last 124 shows. If they don't attempt a completely unique song selection, and the band approaches the Baker's Dozen as it would a typical run of 13 shows, you can plan on seeing about 4 Fuegos, 3 MoMA's, and 2 Gins.¬†

What are the greatest lengths you've ever gone to get to a show?,"Fall 1995, I was a Junior in high school living outside of Denver, CO. I had just gotten my drivers license and my parents were nice enough to give me their old car. They were also surprisingly cool about me going to Phish shows even though I was pretty young. Anyway, Phish had just come off of a smoking hot summer tour, and my crew and I had a blast doing the run of shows from Salt Lake City through Mud Island and we needed more. Unfortunately they didnt come close to us in the fall, but we were determined to catch some shows none-the-less and planned to use my car to hike all the way out to Pershing in Lincoln, NE. When I asked my parents, they made it pretty clear that in no way was I allowed to go to this show, which was 7 hours away. When that weekend finally came we all lied to our parents and told them we were going camping. I doubt they bought it, but when I got back home on Sunday 10/22 my mom was waiting in my room, an old phish tape playing in the boom box, and said ""was it worth it?""

A little story re: July 26th,"I was born in 1983 -- the same year Phish started.

The first time I heard Phish was via my friend's older sister, who played Rift for us, when we were all about 11-12 years old, shortly after it had come out. Sparkle caught my ear, and Lengthwise sealed the deal. I was a phan from then on.

My first show was Nov 2nd, 1998 -- aka the Dark Side of the Moon show in Salt Lake City. I have around 100 shows in my FLAC collection and see maybe 2-6 shows a year.

But really, this is about The Gorge, July 26th, 2013 -- my 30th birthday.

I went with a buddy. The Gorge is 100% GA so we made our way to the floor and camped out just behind the second rail.

A few songs into the first set, Trey starts playing Happy Birthday. My friend looks at me, I look at him; I am speechless. After Trey announces the song is in honor of Chris Kuroda, and I'm still stunned, my friend starts yelling to everyone in range that it is my birthday too. My 30th birthday even. And this is Phish's 30th year anniversary.

Much celebration is had. I'll never, ever forget that moment. To me, Phish sang me Happy Birthday.

So when I say I am excited to see the July 26th MSG show, I really mean, I can't believe how lucky I am that I get to see one of my favorite bands, on my birthday, in one of my favorite cities, at a venue I've always wanted to go to. Words fail me.

Let us all take a moment to be grateful for all the things we have in this life.
 
And I'll see ya'll on the 26th at MSG (and the 28th!).

My birthday wish: Esther or YEM or PYITE.

<3 to all phans.

ISO Phantasy Tour Thread - Staying Overnight inside of MSG,"I'm looking for a thread from a few years ago, where someone wove a tale about spending the night inside of MSG on 12/30, to make sure they got into the 12/31 show. I don't remember the year or many of the specifics, except it involved climbing into the ceiling above a toilet stall, and sleeping in the rafters. A friend of mine just joked about this for the BD, and I want to show him the thread. Thanks!",phish,1500046949,cozziebear5,14,35,True,2017-07-14

Leaving a lottery ticket at will call.,I sold my ticket for Northerly on Cash or Trade. I mailed the ticket last Friday but it still hasn't arrived to the buyer and she is leaving for Chicago.

UPDATE:  
Beware of black male under 30 possibly going by Sean selling 3 day passes on Craigslist for $185.  He is saying that one ticket is good for all 3 nights.

* NMINML to kick it off! Let's get down and funky. 
* I tried to type this during set 1 but seems it didn't stick after the edit... Trey changed the arpeggios before the jam in Theme back to the way he used to play them in 1.0, specifically the second to last C arpeggio. Listen to it from 1.0, listen to it at any other 3.0 performance, and listen to tonight. You heard it here first. 
* Mmm interesting Mike wanted to go to C there, and they band didn't follow...
* Sounds like Page is on the Wurlitzer, and this space in D is just gorgeous. Edit: a jump to the Rhodes from Page... and I hear funk siren from Trey, maybe a WTU? tease from Mike. 
* Guys, I'm speechless... this is amazing. 
* Page is slaughtering, and Trey is in the back ready to peak. HARD. Edit: There it is. They're locked in, everyone. This is not a drill; I repeat this is NOT a drill!!!
* ... 2017 is gonna be a good year. 
* WOW! Very nice. Clocking in at roughly 17 minutes, we have a new contender for jam of the evening - one to remember for sure!
* Trey's tone is fairly aggressive on this Fuego so far. I like it... a touch more compressed and gainy than how he normally plays it. Edit: sounds like Trey is using a phaser or flanger on his guitar now... I approve if he is. 
* Trey keeps flirting with A lydian (think of Maria from West Side Story), and I like it a lot... building tension very nicely. 
* There's no way Phish is playing this well for tour opener. This has to be a ploy to sell more Baker's Dozen tickets. 
* I'm feeling 2001... it'd be awesome if it did... Edit: not quite, but a nice solid groover to keep things moving along and bring everyone up a notch or two. 
* Seems that Mike and Page are giving us a space funk showdown for this YPC... Hopefully it starts straying from the ordinary! Edit: Yup Trey just hit the delay, getting lost in the warm blanket of this delay's feedback...
* Trey wants to take us to Bb... lets see if everyone follows. Edit: yep Mike fell in line and everyone else follows!
* Not the smoothest transition but it WAS slick... I'll allow the -> to stay. 
* Absolutely gorgeous sustain from Trey in the type i portion of this Golden Age. 
* NO! BACK TO YOUR PET CAT?! Impressive. 
* [>mfw](http://imgur.com/a/qHGG3)
* I'm now a melted puddle in Mike's bass drones. 
* Sorry I couldn't get this up sooner guys, apparently it is a new tune. Outro has a chance to do some Bug-like stuff... 
* GET READY TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOOD! I'm excited, hope all of you are too. For those of you keeping track at home, that's the first break they've taken all set and it was barely a moment to catch their collective breath before diving back in. They're excited and ready to put this one straight into the record books. 
* Flub on first ""Thank you Mr. Minor"" lick from Trey... but he recovers in time for the next run. 
* Nice little lick in this Hood jam, almost identical to one Trey plays in Dicks Crosseyed and Painless (9/4/16). Then sounds like he teased the theme from Doug. Edit: seems like most of you identified it as Mountain Jam, which I'm admittedly not familiar with - seems I'll have to hear it tonight. 
* Okay, now that's DEFINITELY a tease I know... reminiscient of 6/20/12 Hood -> WTU?
* And there's the Hood peak. A high-energy Suzy after this would slaughter. 
* I like the placement of this Shine A Light, it's celebratory and a nice chance to collect ourselves while we reflect on what the hell has happened so far this set. 
* Impressive set, I must say... very strong. Third quarter definitely carried the weight, but NMINML through Hood is solid Phish. 
* Some interesting Fish fills there before the final ""I saw you... with a ticket stub in your hand!"" part. 

And that's a wrap! Hope you enjoyed this tour opener as much as I did, everyone. I'm so glad to be back on tour, it looks like 2017 is poised to be a great year for Phish.

Need help identifying jam.,"Hey Garden Partiers (see you all in a week) - I need some help identifying a specific version of a song.

It's either a Tweezer or a Mike's Song, but very likely a Tweezer.

When the jam begins (after the section with lyrics), the band sets into a steady, minimally-melodic groove - very similar to the groove at the beginning of the jam on Tweezer from A Live One.  In the version I'm trying to identify, Trey says ""what"" several times in sync with the beat, then either Fish or Mike says ""nothing"", and the jam continues from there.

I've been trying to find this version of whatever song this is for years, and will toss a glowstick next week to whoever helps identify it!",phish,1500067153,bringbarkleyback,6,2,True,2017-07-14

Worth trying lot Sunday - wanting non-lawn,"Can only attend Sunday in Chicago (attending different music festival in town this weekend).

Everyone says the lawn absolutely sucks at Northerly. I've been keeping an eye on Cash or Trade, but if no luck:

1. What is chance of scoring non-lawn close to face in the lot? Unfortunately can't show up super early either.

2. If no luck, is the lawn not worth $45 face? (enough tickets listed could probs pull one for less)

I know this is a crapshoot, and that phish probably has tons of surprises for us all over this run, but if you had to choose one week night to see them during this event, which would you pick? I say week night because I figure it'll be cheaper than any weekend night as of now, buying from a 3rd party like seek geek.

Should I HD or SD webcast the Baker's Dozen?,"EDIT:  Thanks, /r/phish - I'm going with SD and spending the rest of the money on other entertainment accoutrements.

I always have purchased the HD and I don't think I've missed an official webcast in the years they've been offered (unless I was at the show in person).  Obviously never bought 13 at once so the extra $100 for HD is making me question it.  I mean, that's like 8 growlers of beer from my local brewery right there!  Is it really going to be that big a deal?  If it matters, I stream MacBook Pro > HDMI > Samsung 65"" 4k SUHD-TV which is connected to a pretty decent sound system.

LiveBait vol. 13 is legit,"LiveBaits have, in the past, been a little hit-and-miss for me but Volume 13 is pushing _all_ the right buttons this year. The opening Wedge goes places you just don't expect and resolves so succinctly. The 'lope that follows has a blistering middle jam that builds a way outside run to a beautiful peak at the 7:45 mark. And it just goes on from there.

Three thumbs up from me to whomever picked the tracks this year. Not a dud in bakers dozen.

Hello beautiful people! I missed out on last night's festivities so tonight is officially opening night for me. Thanks to /u/supafish93 and /u/ljstella for thinking of me during the Hood, I was listening in spirit <3. So stoked to be back here with you all and counting down the days until I leave for opening weekend of YEMSG! 

/u/TheRoostar almost talked me into driving up to Chicago for tonight but alas, adulting won out. Besides, hanging with you fine people on couch tour is almost as fun as being there. 

Calling a Reba opener because it's time to take her off the shelf. Let's hear where you're from and your predictions for tonight!

"Tonight's Winterqueen cured my case of being a ""Set II Bumout"" Grouch","It's not like I fell in love with Winterqueen, but after tonight I feel like I finally understand why the band has placed it after so many great Set II jams.  

The band really sold it as a tune that can simmer things down but keep the juices flowing.  My quick reaction is that 7/15/17 Winterqueen is my favorite version ever (only because I love it, versus every other version that kinda disappointed me).  

I vow to be more patient with songs I have previously considered ""2nd Set Bumouts"".*

This post is meant to be positive.  I really liked tonight's 2nd Set Winterqueen, for the first time ever, and that makes me optimistic for future 2nd set ballads between great improvisational events.

The new lights are gonna look amazing indoors,"Watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1aPzqle49o) of last night's jaw dropping Simple got me thinking... this is clearly a light rig built for MSG. 

The rig looks a bit funny under that giant festival style stage, especially when CK5 brings it down close to the band. But in an arena, where the band is in the middle of the action with people behind them, this rig is gonna give new meaning to Mothership. (Too bad there's no Hampton this summer!). Picture the YEM vocal jam when he does the whole spaceship landing thing w/ the lights, to literally have the lights come down right on top of the band... oh yea.

Page's New Synthesizer,"So I have to say, I've been absolutely FLOORED by the new synth work from Page so far in Chicago, it's taking jams into deeper directions and allowing the band to explore an ENTIRELY new framework for jams. I was browsing Instagram this afternoon and came across [this shot](https://instagram.com/p/BWnfdi7AX8a), which confirms that Page HAS added a new bit of gear to his rig: a Dave Smith Instruments Prophet '08. 

This is a classic analog synth (or, for certain models like his Prophet '08, an analog synth with digital knob controls) made famous by Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, Vangelis (think the Blade Runner and Chariots of Fire soundtracks), and Thom Yorke. 

It's also worth noting, Page had an original Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 in his rig back in the late '90s, it was the synth responsible for lots of the layered and textured loop jams (think Big Cypress Sand, for example). This would explain how many of the jams are starting to swing out into that spacey, layered, and textured vibe a la the late '90s. If Trey starts abusing his Leslie rotary speaker again this year, we're in for some really detailed and washy jams - color me very excited. 

For those of you at the pre-BD shows, enjoy getting lost in the glorious washes that this beast can produce! It's been next on my must-purchase synth list for a while now, and as we're witnessing firsthand with Phish it can produce some absolutely monstrous sounds. 

Ninja edit: it's worth noting, it looks like Page has the Prophet mounted immediately above his trusty Yamaha CS-80, so he can play both at the same time. Needless to say... it's gonna be a good summer. 

Edit 2: also... if Trey brings back the Yamaha AN-1x synth like he used to have in '99-'00, we're in for some serious mind melting jams!",phish,1500236380,Wforwumbo,29,60,True,2017-07-16

#**Thoughts:** 

**Pre-Show**
>< Just getting it up, stay tuned. I've had quite the gauntlet of shit today. Patience please! 

>< Okay, in the words of /u/shellica last night, HO LEE SHIT. I left DE beach at 1 PM. What is a 4.5 hr drive back to LI... I ~~just got back 20 minutes ago~~ returned after a 7 hr drive to a house with NO INTERNET. No heads up!! Raced to the lab to get the thread up and running, and my fucking work laptop's HD had to scan and repair?!?! IT'S A YEAR AND A HALF OLD LAPTOP. WTFFFFFFFF. Finally turned on just now, just in time I think. I will populate the rest of this right now.

>< Soundcheck songs that were played... overheard that from the guys on the mixlr feed.



**Set I**
>< HERE WE GO BOYS AND GIRLS. FEWWWWWWWWW

>< MIKE HAS BLUE LIPSTICK ON AGAIN

>< Possum intro sounds like a The Who song...

>< This is a fackin DRIPPY 555.

>< Now that I'm settled!! HAH. I'm grubbin' on some Rocco's Zah (St. James, LI, NY), and sipping some Barrier Greenroom PA, Montauk IPA, and Troegs Nimble Giant 2x IPA.

>< GIMME A FUNKY LONG TUBE!!! 

>< This Tube's feelin a little walky talky...

>< Trey's tone sounds eons better over the AUD (and I assume live) than it did on the LP SBDs from the past two nights, which I listened to ON MY 7 HOUR DRIVE HOME TODAY.

>< Dat slow build kitty doh.

>< What did Page call Mike? ""Michael Eliza Gordon?"" Like Liza Minnelli? (Apparently it was ""Mike Eliot Gordon"" a la /u/dub1808).


>< There's the Stash tension.... waiting for the release..... no release just more tension!!!!! 

>< Page decided to give us a little organ flair to start off The Line. Distractions, deflections, were used to it Page, we have a fucking clown in the Oval. I'm not phased. Stepping outside.

>< THAT is a nice 1-2: Birds, Funky Bitch

>< This Birds, Funky Bitch, Antelope is just swell. They're crushing the entire suite.

**Setbreak**

>< Well, well, well. That was a well constructed first frame, folks. No doubt about it, they are well on their way to a dialed-in second set. I'm calling Tweezer, Mercury, Roggae, and YEM.

>< Here's some [setbreak tunes ](https://www.jambase.com/article/peter-tosh-plays-montreux-date-1979)from /u/djarumgreen.

**Set II**

>< /u/A_Chimenti_O_Face said it best: ""Carini is ab to blow this 2nd set open."" HERE WE GO PEOPLE!! Sunday funday in full effect.

>< Ummmm.... we're 4 minutes into this Carini and have achieved lift-off? Jesus fellas.

>< ~15 minutes into Carini... we've gone from a menacing ?minor? key to some seriously blissful hose jamming (/u/wforwumbo says it's A>D). This is some of the best composure and straight hose flow of the weekend. Fuck me silly.

>< That was a SICK 20 minute (all of it) Carini, with a nearly perfect segue into 20 Years Later. And now I'm really excited. I think that Carini was better than the Simple last night...

>< Quorum reached. That was a flawless Carini **->** 20 Years Later. Kang'd.

>< Okay, so IMO Birds, Funky Bitch, Antelope was all straight great. I think they're keeping it going from the very start of this second set. The switch turned on at Birds. This Carini -> 20 Years Later > Piper is just fire. Piper is bringing some serious energy to the set. 

>< That new song Thread has some GREAT potential. Very grungy and lots of potential for 46 days-esque jams? BUT WAIT NOW GIN. WTF THIS SET?!?!

>< I got me some [Bathtub ZAH](http://i.imgur.com/1V6NeyR.jpg). Hoo Lee Pizza folks. I ain't from NY... best thing about moving here.

>< This GIN IS AMAZEBALLS. Rounding an hour into Set 2..... YEM is next.

>< 2001. Jesus fucking christ people. It's a full-on Sunday Funday throwdown, folks.

>< This 2001 is filthy thump funk. Swampy as it gets. Fish is freaking out on the Sex Machine.

>< This is going to be a very fierce Cavern. Set ender.

>< SHORT second set. 1 hr 10 minutes?!? They're coming out with something to fill 20 minutes. You know what I've called. Either way, this has been an INCREDIBLE show. Birds on, straight fire. They are locked in.


**Encore**

>< Interesting choices for the encore. I'll take this as celebratory because they just slayed the entire second set.


**Thats a wrap, folks! Woof. What a great second set, set up by a solid first. This one has my vote for MVP of the weekend, but to each their own. Can't WAIT to host the next one. I'll be at Baker's. Currently have 7/22, 7/25, 7/29, and 8/3. Will probably add another one or two to that list.... chasing my 50th this run. If any of y'all want to grab a beer, hit me up! Feeling VERY excited for this summer. They've come out swingin.**",phish,1500249655,fishkey,1209,140,True,2017-07-16

Pages New Synthesizers - An Update (now with more synths!),"Now that the new [Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlcHi4c_22w) video from this Northery run has been released by Phish, I decided to sit down and watch them in action while executing this masterful jam. I also had a tiny hope I'd get a closer look at some of the new gear they're using, and boy did the video deliver. 

I snapped [this photo](http://imgur.com/a/TQHN9) at the 11:21 mark, which gives us a decent view of Page's entire setup. This answers MANY of the questions I've had about how he's accomplishing lots of the textures that he is. Turns out, he's now running THREE synthesizers in his keyboard rig:

* A Moog Minimoog Voyager (at least I THINK it's a Voyager - and not the Voyager XL - as it seems to only have 44 keys), which is responsible for some of the sustained tones. It is sitting right above his Wurlitzer. Page plays it in tandem with the Wurlitzer right when this Simple starts taking off; you can hear it come in as the long, sustained notes at 6:15 in the video. You can also get a VERY clear shot of him playing the Voyager at 13:00 minutes in to the video. 
* A Yamaha synth that sits, as usual for the past few years, atop his Rhodes. If you look just a fraction of a second earlier from the above screenshot in [this other screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/YUC7M), you can see that it is indeed a Yamaha CS-60 - there was some discussion in my last thread regarding Page's synths as to what exactly it was, and this clearly confirms that it's the CS-60 (which Page has notably had for all of 3.0; it's unclear as per phish.net if he had a CS-80 back in the late '90s). If you want an example of what this synth sounds like, think of What's The Use? or Meatstick. 
* The Dave Smith Instruments Prophet '08. It sits on top of the CS-60. I haven't found a clear example in this video yet of him using the Prophet, I'll dig though the sound clips of this weekend to see if I can point to a concrete example of it being used. In the meantime, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq3Nvq4xUU4) is an okay overview of a bunch of sounds that it is capable of (though note that, despite the insane flexibility shown here, it can do MUCH MUCH more than what is in the video!)

That seems to settle a decent number of questions I and others seemed to have. Excited to see how this pans out for the rest of tour. My comments from my last post about IAWITW/Trey's re-addition of the Yamaha AN1x/Trey's increased reliance on the Leslie rotary speaker could push jams to a new stratosphere - still hold.

I know this show was released as Live Phish Vol. 7, but I'm looking to see if any recordings of the soundcheck exist? The entry on .net for this show indicates that a ""Long Jam"" was played as the soundcheck (along with a Funky Bitch), about 45 mins long that sounded ""McGrupp-like."" I gotta hear this. I'm hoping a recording of this soundcheck exists somewhere, as it's not on the AUD on the spreadsheet as many other soundchecks are. If this exists, someone please share it with us! Thank you!!",phish,1500309524,RFWM17,1,3,True,2017-07-17
Will official merch be on-sale outside MSG before the shows?,"I‚Äôm asking because I‚Äôd like to grab a poster and run it back to the hotel room before the show.  Will they have tubes for the posters? 


Update: Thank you everyone, this really helps!


Quick recap:

- NO reentry allowed at MSG

- the merch tables will have poster tubes

- there are merch tables after security and before you get your ticket scanned


The Plan

- no need to bring a poster tube on the plane to NYC

- get to the show early

- get through security

- get the to merch table

- run merch back to the hotel

- get back to MSG

- go through security again

- get ticket scanned

- have a great show with nothing to hold on to or worry about!

Broke up with my girlfriend for 4 guys,"I'm 24, been going to Phish shows for about 4 years now (Magnaball Divided Sky Day 2 opener was my it/ truly life changing moment at Phish). Anyways, took a girl I had been seeing for a couple months now to her first Phish shows in Chicago this weekend. She was skeptical but I told her that this is kinda my thing that I look forward to all year so she agreed to spend the money. 

So skip to night 3 last night. Gets to about 5 and I wanna get going and she says she's still hungover from Saturday night and wants to just lay in bed with me all night. 

Skip to an argument because there's
No way in hell im missing the show (especially a Sunday show obviously). She basically gives me an ultimatum That if I go to the show we're over. I said ok make sure you're not here when I get back.

I know this may sound douchey, but I mean why would I miss out on show just for a girl I didn't plan on marrying or anything anyways. Guess this was a test you face and she failed.

I don't know, just felt like sharing. Rock on

"""In The Good Old Summertime"" alternate lyrics sung by Phish, can't find in any other version. Anyone know about this?","Ok so i was just looking into the song because I like it and i wanted to know its history. I found [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Good_Old_Summer_Time) which lists the lyrics but some of the things Phish sings are not in the lyrics. But a footnote in the article leads to [this page](http://levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu/catalog/levy:147.102) with the original sheet music for the song, including a whole page of extra rarely-sung verses. But still, not there. 

For example, Phish's intro is 

*""Like a milliionaire, extraordinaire

Though i have in a time (?)

it's not a crime

to feel sublime""*

And then later the verse about ""it really is the most surprising when the temperature is rising"" etc. I can't find any of these lyrics anywhere as a group on google, did Phish just kind of add this?

Need a last minute phriend to enjoy NYC with me!,"So guys I have a problem. For months I've been planning booking and buying tickets for me and a friend to go to Baker's Dozen together Aug 2-7. I booked us an Airbnb in Brooklyn for only $555 :p for 5 nights, tickets for the last 4 nights of Phish 2nd, 4th 5th and 6th (Night 1 is floors, night 2 and 4 are in the 100s section, and night 3 is bar stools 200s) They were $95 each and I also last minute got tickets for Punch Brothers at the Beacon Theater on the 3rd. Well last week I ask her for $610 for the whole trip not including Punch Brothers tickets. She's not a huge bluegrass fan. She's known about this for months, we've been planning this literally since the rumors for Baker's Dozen came out. Well today she tells me that she won't be able to pay for anything and can't go. Now of course I'm a little bit pissed! I have been working my ass off planning, trading, and buying everything, with not one thank you from her! Now any normal person/phriend would have been paying me what she could, saving all along for such a big trip, or if she couldn't afford it tell me before 2 weeks before we leave. I Think she was just thinking that I was gonna pay for the whole thing which is definitely not happening. 

Now I apologize for the long bitch post. Don't know if this is weird but the real point of this is that I'm looking for a new phriend to come enjoy New York City and party at Phish with me! Of course there's definitely lots of details and shit to talk about. I just want a preferably female who's down to party, have fun, and meet new people.

Thank you Page Side!,"Just feeling so happy with this last Chicago shows that I just wanted to share my experience.
My first show was last year St. Paul, which I still enjoyed since it was my first show, yet I've heard mixed reviews. This Chicago run was therefore my 2-3-4th shows.

7/14. Mike side. Loved it. Didn't expect a Your Pet Cat at all, cried a little. Jams were great. Danced a ton.

7/15. Moved to Page side. Died. I hard a hard time looking away. Some major fans allowed me to stand by them, about 4 rows back. Made some really nice friends.

7/16. Started further away for 1st set but was invited back to where I was the day before for 2nd set. Could not look away! My fitbit counted 40,222 steps that day and a peak heart rate at 147 at 7:40pm! (probably got higher, but it started to die not long after)

So, overall, thank you Phish phans for allowing someone like me, who hasn't seen a bunch of phish shows, who didn't show up 2 hours before doors open, but loved the show (probably even more than some of you did! lol)
I hope to see you all at the next show I go to and hope to have the same love again.

PS. I got to meet Mike the day after the shows 7/17 and my friends and I wrote a setlist for Dayton for Mike. Hope you'll like it if Trey approved it!

"Setlist Thread - 2017/07/18 - Nutter Center - Dayton, OH","# Phish 2017/07/18 Nutter Center, Dayton, OH


**Reba dropped a boulder in the water....Reba tied Ohio to a tree...and I'm hoping she does the same thing to me tonight...**


What‚Äôs up, everyone! It's that time again: time for another supafish93 setlist thread! I'm Fish, your intrepid host and tonight I'll be your tour guide through the cosmos (sorry). Tonight we have the P Fish from Vermont on their return to the Nutter center after 20 years of waiting (thanks for the math update, u/fishkey). Here‚Äôs to a kickass show, my fellow phans!


I‚Äôm here in the suburbs of Chicago, set up in my living room with my laptop streaming the Phish show and chatting with you folks! Might also be jamming along on my [Bertha](http://imgur.com/XY5sZS5), my trusty Fender Starcaster (god she‚Äôs gorgeous)

Gimme some calls! Just because I'm not there, I KNOW they're gonna be playing Reba and YEM. So that's happening. Also calling a MONSTER Maze in the first set, because why not. Also, as a 20th anniversary thing, a Jesus Just Left Chicago.

Enjoy the show, my friends, my friends!

(8:01PM): I'm in love with Mike and Page's collective sound here. Some space funk yes please.

(8:02PM): BOMBS HAVE DROPPED I REPEAT BOMBS HAVE DROPPED

(8:10PM): The circus here at r/phish is MOST DEFINITELY the place for me.

(8:17PM): Okay. Sugar Shack. They soundchecked this the last day of Chicago, so HOPEFULLY that means Trey has been practicing! Here goes nothin'!

(8:39PM): Oooh some MGB stuff. This song RIPPED at Summer Camp

(8:53PM): u/CSnyder23 just texted me ""WE'RE GOING '03""

(8:54PM): And Jim! Okay!

(8:55PM): Not sure what's Trey's deal tonight. He had no problem letting things jam in the first set in Chicago, so not sure why he's back to his old ripcord-y ways tonight. Still loving this set regardless.

(8:57PM): Anyone who wants to chat during setbreak, I'll be doing a chat mixed in with some jams from 20 years ago on my mixlr! Come hang! Link is above.

(10:03PM): Mountains in the Mist was last played 88 shows ago according to u/Wforwumbo and 89 shows ago according to u/MarkRosewater. So approximately 88.5 shows ago.

(10:04PM): Have to admit, I've never really listened to Mountains in the Mist much! I'm LOVING this one! Very Dead-y vibe.

(11:00PM): 11 on the dot. I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING.

(11:01PM): You guys what an amazing show. I can't wait to share the next one with you! That Coil at the end honestly had me welling up super hard. Dayton Ghost is also now a thing. Let's see if it goes up on the Phish youtube page! I'm saying it does.

-I really like More and Petrichor and went to 12/31/16 having a great feeling they'd play both. It was almost like I paid the $150 GA ticket just to see those two songs, and they didn't let me down.

Trying to take Mom and Family to see Phish,"So...I have been to many Phish shows but the Baker's Dozen is giving an opportunity I haven't had before given its close proximity to my origin in NJ.  I am trying to get my entire family to come with to the show to experience the wonderful time I have at Phish show's and see what its all about.

Why doesn't Phish do this with TM?,"So I went to buy some U2 tix today well after they went on sale.  As I'm trying to score tix lo and behold there are GA tix available.  I thought it was odd a band as big as U2 wouldn't have sold out the floor but without further ado went and purchase them.

Then I had the aha! moment.  U2 only sells floors as credit card entry only.  In other words by buying the ticket you agree that they cannot be transferred in any way shape or form.  Can't make the gig?  Tough.  

So my question is why won't Phish do this?  Clearly there is a huge demand for tickets and this obviously prevents scalping.  Obviously not every ticket is going to be this way, but it certainly guarantees that those who have made an effort to see them (i.e. time off work, travel plans) actually get to.

Just a story I wanted to share with you all,"I am a little late sharing this story but I immediately thought of /r/phish when it happened and finally got around to typing it out. It probably will seem pointless or lackluster, especially now that I've waited, but it amused me so here it goes.

For those of you who don't know, there is a cover band in Chicago called Sixteen Candles. Now, the thing about this cover band, is they play just about every street festival there is in Chicago all year round. Chances are, if you've ever been to a Chicago street festival and heard a cover band, it was Sixteen Candles. They are pretty good as far as cover bands go. They play music that a crowd likes. You know, ""Come on Ilene,"" ""Take on Me,"" some Queen, I'm sure. Oh, and they also have a way of creeping up on you. You don't even realize you're listening to the same band you heard at the last festival until they finish a song and announce they're Sixteen Candles.

Anyway, it was about a week ago and I had just been standing around at another Chicago street fest (Wells Street Art Fair), listening to another cover band play their second round of ""Jesse's Girl"" in three songs. That's right, two ""Jesse's Girls"" in three songs. And my buddy and I were talking about how it was probably Sixteen Candles up there again, when the singer finished up a song and announced that they were, indeed, Sixteen Candles. My friend and I started talking about how, maybe it's just Sixteen Candles or maybe it's something about Chicago street festivals in general, but they all seem to blend together and feel the same no matter which one or where they are.

But then, in the humid, chattery downtime between 80s covers, something happened. The guitarist ripped a Tweezer riff. This was doubly cool because my friend and I had just been talking about my love of Phish and how he was a phan for a while in the 90s before losing touch. So the guitarist played a couple bars of Tweezer and bailed. Then they went back into a third round of ""Jesse's Girl.""

Just kidding. But I am truly still perplexed by why they played two ""Jesse's Girls"" in three songs. 

Anyway, the band played a couple more songs and then bam. Divided Sky riff, which the singer talked over and wouldn't humor. A little more downtime and then Fluffhead riff. No bite from the singer that time either.

Anyway, there might have been one more riff the guitarist laid down but each time the singer kind of threw a wet blanket on it. I guess I understand‚Äîtheir gig is to play Springsteen and stuff. I just thought it was sweet to get to jam to Phish tunes, even if only for a moment, at one of Chicago's dozens of generic street festivals. Side note: If you are a Phish fan and are familiar with the ubiquitous Chicago street festival cover act that is Sixteen Candles, you will understand that this was a truly unexpected experience. 

So, that's what I came here to share. Phish is in more places than you know and sometimes pops up when you least expect it.",phish,1497664113,SoulSerpent,6,13,True,2017-06-16

I guess I'm just not always convinced that longer is necessarily better. There are jams in early 1.0 that I LOVE that seem to be shorter than beloved versions in the later 90's.

Meatstick,"One of my favorite phish memories is when I first feel in love with meatstick. Up until I saw them play it in Vegas '00, I thought it was a cheesy boring song, that was tried to hard to get people to line dance (the macarane had been around). 

I was seated a little way up the bowl Paige side .  I kind of sighed when they started it, but danced and boogied, cause you know.... phish. Anyway they raged it. It was all over the place, dark and funky, simply awesome. And every time one of them would return to the structure, play a sequence from the composed part, the audience would do their little twirl, or other scripted move and then back into their own unique groove.

I found a 3 day lawn pass for Chicago for $140 ($172.45 with all the fees) on StubHub. My question is, what was face value for the 3 day pass?

$140 seemed too good to be true, and I am now worried (most likely unnecessarily) that it might be. I already bought it, so I guess I will just wait and see what happens at the Friday show. They're supposed to be delivered via UPS by 7/11. I really wish they would be here sooner.

Has anyone been scammed by StubHub tickets? I've used them a number of times for baseball games and a few concerts, but not a Phish 3 day pass. I know they'll refund me if they don't work or they'll try to find replacement tickets but, i'd obviously rather not go through that BS.

Trying to get floor tickets for the last Bakers Dozen weekend is insane.,"I am determined to get floor.

Will ticket prices go down on stubhub as it gets close? It seems like they keep getting higher. I am really determined to be on the floor all 4 (or 5) nights I was anticipating to go. I really fucking hate ticketmaster/stubhub but I may just have to resort to it, and bite the damn bullet. AHHH!!!

An excerpt from Trixie Garcia's AMA...,"Question from: youenjoymyself 

Hey! Thanks for taking time for this AMA!

I was curious if you are aware that you might have been referenced in a new Phish song after GD50. The song, Blaze On, Trey sings, ""I saw a red dress, I met a daughter."" The whole vibe of the song seems to be Trey's elated joy to having been able to play and meet the Dead and crew, and likely you, too! Am I just imagining this, or did you and Trey have nice conversations?

Answer:

I know that the song isn't about me, but I did have an intense conversation with Trey at GD50. Me and my sister were sitting with Trey and his two daughters. We were just chatting, and he said, ""My daughter's nineteen, what were you doing when you were 19?"" And I said, ""Jerry died when I was 20."" The look on his face was priceless, like he realized that he had beaten the demon. He wasn't going to die, and he was going to be there for his daughters. It was a sweet moment.


-----------

Just thought I would share this excerpt. As a new fan from Fare Thee Well, I am amazingly grateful that I get to see an intact, sober, happy Trey, every time I see him, whether it is solo or with Phish.

Phish Dry Goods - not so goods.,"I cannot be the only person who thinks that the vast majority of Phish Dry Goods merch is plain or uninspired or both.

Will they repeat a song during the BD?,"When the shows were first announced I figured they would definitely repeat songs, but as time has passed, a couple things have changed my perspective:

1) Trey's overall excitement in interviews. 

2) The fact that they sold people (like myself) on committing to all 13 shows 

3) It pushes the boundaries of what Phish can do. It's a challenge and something they've never done before

As of now I'm entirely convinced they won't repeat a song. I know that would require a lot of digging into the catalog, and would take as many songs as they typically play in a full tour, but that essentially what this is anyway.

I do think we'll know fairly early on if they're gonna repeat or not. If they play all of their typical bangers in the first weekend, then it's likely they'll repeat. If they only play a few, then they're likely stretching the catalog as far as possible ",phish,1498781522,Zappastuski,14,3,True,2017-06-29

Hi everyone! Phish noob here looking for some guidance.,"I just started seriously listening to Phish like... this past week. I'd always kinda dug their sound but for some reason I started from the beginning of their Spotify discography recently and my God... I'm hooked. 

I guess I'm just looking for some direction.

I want to see a show this year, and could probably make it to one of the Baker's Dozen, but can't afford it at the moment. My first question is: will they all sell out? Or will I be able to buy a ticket kinda last minute if I do end up being able to go?

Second question is: any must-listens to get me properly acquainted? I went to school in Burlington, and I've heard plenty of cover bands and other phish-y jams, but never the real thing. But now I'm just ravenous for their music and want to hear it all. I know I'm probably coming across as over zealous, but I've seriously never fallen in love with music like this since I discovered the Grateful Dead years ago. Any advice on best shows or albums or individual songs is great!!

Lastly: are there any places to find relatively cheap tickets for these upcoming shows? Like cheaper than Ticketmaster? I went to some Dead and Co this summer and was able to find some trade/sell pages and stuff like that. Just looking to get in the door and listen. 

Thank you very much!

Phish Therapeutic ISO Playlist,"Greetings Phriends!

I recently had a conversation discussing using music as therapy for depression and anxiety. (I won't go into all the details right now...maybe later on). The idea of using music as therapy is, I'm sure, not new to anyone here. Phish is a HUGE influence on my life, and this is no exception. However, many times I try to use it and just get frustrated. Well, in this discussion I was having, the topic of the ISO playlist came up. The basic idea is simple: start with a couple songs that validate the feeling you are having (whether it be sad, angry, or frustrated), then use a few transition songs to start bringing you out of that dark place. Finally, play some songs that make you feel like you're on top of the world! Then, just keep playing songs like this as long as you need.

I loved this idea. Of course, the first band that came to mind was Phish. They have such a plethora of options for music of all moods, from happy (Hood), to sad (Velvet Sea), to scary (Guyute or Ha Ha Ha), to frantic (Llama)! I love it all, and can't think of a better band to make my first playlist.

This is where you guys and gals come in! I'm looking for suggestions for playlists, songs, setlists, or anything in between to fit this! I feel like happy songs are the easiest to pick out (nobody can deny that Fluffy peak!), but some sad songs can be pretty tough. For a little more challenge, I want to try to get some suggestions for jams that start out slow- and sad-sounding, but end up with pure euphoria!

Let's have some fun with this! What do you think? Can you help me out? This subreddit has quickly become my absolute favorite one because of the sense of community -- I feel like it really embodies the true feel of the band and its fans.

''joy'' causes her to burst into tears. she freezes for the whole song, mouth agape, tears a flowin. those who attempt to get by us are denied access by this tiny frozen woman. a very large man yells ''BAD TRIP?'' and the thought is simultaneously concerning and hilarious to all around (no she had not partaken since the 60s) 4.later after getting her groove back the large man offers her a high five which she returns very reluctantly and only after my approval, as my friends and I had (jokingly, unbeknownst to her) previously warned her about wook contact and caused her to fear ''surprise acid trips'' 5. as the show is reaching its end she pulls a joint from her bosom (""MOM?'') and my world was forever changed.

we also heard some dude (obviously tripping hard) flew off a balcony! this fact only solidified her reasoning behind denying all high fives during the zombie walk out(''N-NO THANK YOU'' *flees*) 

I hope she never dies but when she does we like to think it'll happen at a show (yes she loves Phish now) after finally succumbing to a seemingly innocent high five at the age of idk 105 only to be betrayed by ACID SURPRISE causing her to believe she can fly from a balcony like that brave man of yesteryear. Her tombstone quote shall read ''damn wooks and their trickery.''

--------------------------------------------

-Hello and welcome to the 4th annual /r/phish summer tour contest! Can you believe we‚Äôre onto 4 years of this contest? Time sure does fly. 

-Now what is this you might be asking? It's a contest to see how well you can guess what songs Phish is going to playing every night of their 2017 summer tour from Chicago to NY to Commerce City.

-It's simple to enter. In the Google Doc linked above put in your guesses on what you think Phish will be playing that night. Select the date, enter your songs, and submit!

-The standard categories to guess are set 1 opener, set 1 closer, set 1 wildcard, set 2 opener, set 2 closer, set 2 wildcard, and encore along with two bonus categories which are bustout and a cover song. A wildcard is a song that they play in the set.

-There are new point values! Standard Categories: The set openers, closers, and then encore categories are worth 3 points each. Wildcard categories are worth 2 points. If you happen to guess a perfect set under the Standard Categories for the night you get 10 bonus points added on to your total.

**-Partial Points: If you guess a song in one set (say, set 1) and it's played in another set (say, set 2), then that is a partial point worth 1 point (this includes the encore).**

-Bonus Categories: Bustouts are then worth 5 points and cover songs are worth 3. Cover song guesses that are ‚Äòno covers‚Äô will net 1 point.

-Clarifications: A bustout is a song that hasn't been played in 50 shows minimum. A cover is a song that is considered a TAB/Mike/Vida Blue/Pork Tornado (god forbid) song or obviously by another artist. I consider everything on an album an original (Manteca, Bug), plus SOME songs that haven't really found a home on an album (Halley's Comet, How Many People Are You). Please ask for certain clarifications on what you think is considered a cover. If enough people disagree then I‚Äôll put up a poll to decide.

-Your bustout call can be the same as the opener, closer, encore, or wildcard. An example is that you say your bustout call is All Things Reconsidered, you can also say that All Things Reconsidered can be a set 2 wildcard. However, if you put another song (say, The Oh Kee Pah Ceremony) as your set 2 wildcard and then pick All Things Reconsidered as your bust out call and only Oh Kee Pah gets played then you get just the appropriate point amount for that guess. To help look at songs with a 50+ show gap you can look here. http://www.phish.net/songs 

-If you wish to put the same guess for a cover and bustout, you can. Covers and bustouts are rare. If you're crazy enough to call those categories together you may go ahead. **Debuts can count as a bustout (if you're brave!).**

-You must post in the Google Form for your calls to count. If your call is posted in this thread, rather than Google Form, I'm not responsible for tracking it.

-What is the point of this whole contest? Well, there are real life and virtual prizes! 1st place gets $25 from the Dry Goods store with a month of Reddit Gold, 2nd place gets to choose from up to 3 items on the stickers/patches page of the Dry Goods store with a month of Reddit Gold, and 3rd place gets one sticker/patch from the Dry Goods store and a month of Reddit Gold. 

-There is a link at the top of the page for donating to the contest! Wanna throw a couple bucks to relieve the total I will be paying at the end of the contest or wanna add to the pool? Donate to my Paypal! All money collected will be turned around to the contest. I will not be keeping any of it. http://bit.ly/2s7MX4Y**

**-For this tour only if you enter in every night of the Baker's Dozen run you will be put into a drawing for a $15 gift card to Dunkin Donuts! Only one winner will be drawn!**

-Your picks must be in by the scheduled show time. Here is a time zone converter to make sure you don't miss the start time of each show. 

-This will be going all tour and pinned to the sidebar above the tour dates to help you remember to enter before each show. The winners will be announced the a few days after the Dicks' run (come find me there this year!).

-You can enter in all of your guesses today or guess each show the day of the show before it starts every tour date. Either will work. Just remember to enter it in before the band takes stage or else I'm going to throw out the responses. I will use [@Phish_FTR](https://twitter.com/Phish_FTR) tweets to get accurate times to cut off.

-If you have any questions please shoot me a reply in this thread or in a PM.

-Note: If you see the spreadsheets in jumble, I apologize since I am probably working on figuring out scores.

"My massive Phish.net ""Recommended"" jams Spotify playlist (Updated)","[Playlist Link](https://play.spotify.com/user/1265043326/playlist/3FdZNyZ42vMB5szof9EA3N?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open)

Spotify URI (paste into player): spotify:user:1265043326:playlist:3FdZNyZ42vMB5szof9EA3N

It's been a year since I posted my playlist, which now has close to 2,400 subscribers. The playlist consists of all tracks rated as ""Recommended"" on Phish.net that are available on Spotify (Note: this is a higher standard than ""Noteworthy""). There are also some important segue tracks as well as Union Federal and some Siket Disc tracks. They are sorted chronologically to the best of my ability (This was time consuming for A Live One and Live Phish filler tracks). 

Some statistics:

Range: 7/30/88 - 1/2/2016 (27 years 5 months 3 days)

Longest track: Halloween 95 YEM - 40:33

Shortest track: Roxy 93 I Am Hydrogen - 0:28

Biggest gap: Not a single jam from 1990, the year they played the most shows.

Playlist length:  286 tracks, 56 hours 11 min

Suggestions are always appreciated. Enjoy!

Baker's Dozen No Repeats Fantasy Setlists,"So I want to try a thing.

"[Long shot] Trying to find an OLD thread from a forum ""What's the Funniest Thing You've Overheard a Wook say?"" [X-post from r/festivals]","Edit: Holy shit, I found it!  I have been looking for this off and on for YEARS!  Enjoy!

https://www.phantasytour.com/bands/phish/threads/2242958/funniest-thing-a-wook-said#page/1


I know this is a long shot but I'm trying to find an old thread that was about the funniest things people have overheard wooks saying at concerts and fests.  

As I remember it, the OP was writing some kind of script for TV or a movie that had wooks in it and was looking for examples to make the dialogue sound real.  

Some of the highlights I can remember:

* A guy passing out at a fest and his girlfriend starts freaking out.  A random wook runs over, tells the girlfriend to pull down his pants and shove an ice cube up his ass.  She does it and the guy wakes up freaking out about how he's so cold

* A wook asking a guy smoking a cig if he can have the ""Bobby Shorts"" of his smoke

* A wook watching a Dead concert and the only person you can see on stage from where they're standing is Joan, the wook calls it ""The Joan Zone""

Anyway, there were about 15 pages of submissions and they were all hilarious.  I probably read it for the first time back in 2010 and it may have been a year or two old at that point.  I'm about 95% sure this was on the Phish forums.

I used to have it bookmarked and would read it occasionally for a laugh but I lost the site and I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere.  Does anybody else remember this or even have it saved somewhere?",phish,1494603222,canaryminer,12,9,True,2017-05-12

We are everywhere. Rocket League Ed. xpost/r/homestarrunner,"I'm a 7 on the drunk scale rn, and a 9 on the stoned scale but here it goes.

I play a lot of Rocket League. And the past year or so my handle has been the most obscure Phish reference I can think of, ""Italian Spaghetti"". For the first time in about a year, I play with player TROGDORRRRRRRRRR (fawhumagawds),  

So this dude, TROGDORRRRRRRRRR, goes 
   
    ""reaction time like a sloth"" 

after drunk and stoned me clearly lets up a goal. I'm freakin' my deakin', and I give up 2 more goals over the next 4:20 mins. Really bad. But then, with 30 seconds left we make a great connection for our first goal. TROGDORRRRRRRRRR responds:

    ""Response time like an antelope""

I'm on cloud 9 as I prepare to shout the words I've been waiting to shout since the day I left my mother's vagina (happy mother's day y'all)...

    ""THEY CALL ME THE SLOTH! ITALIAN SPAGHETTI! SLEEPIN' 
     ALL DAY.""

Glorious! GLORIOUS!!! We go one to score 2 more to tie up the game in the remaining 30 seconds. I send him/her a homoerotic
    
    ""Destiny Unbound ;)""

In the last 4 seconds the opponent scores to secure a victory. To which our opponent exclaims as he/she shoves our heads in a pile of shit...

    ""Can you still have fun?""

An Open Letter To r/Phish,"One of the things I love most about Phish outside of the music is the fans.  What's not to love?  They are some of the friendliest and most loyal fans there are.

This subreddit has almost 20k subscribers.  It could be a fantastic place to share Phish news and media, yet it has never seen a single post break 1000 up-votes. Why?  Well, to be honest, it just feels like this subreddit attracts a lot of really douchey fans.  

I am not trying to blanket that over everyone. I have definitely met a lot of great fans on r/phish, but the truth is I constantly browse new on here and see people with great posts getting down-voted to no reason. People busting balls.  People making fun of new phans with questions they think are ""stupid.""  That doesn't help the bands following.  It doesn't help this community flourish.  It just ruins the experience for everyone.

I know all of you aren't going to shows and treating people like shit, so maybe consider giving that same respect when you are sitting behind a computer screen or smartphone.

Named Jams Project Vol. 2 (and Vol. 1),"Hi everyone, I'm back with a second set of legendary jams. The Named Project is a compilation of some of Phish's best jams, as contributed by the fan community. Named Jams, such as Tahoe Tweezer, Chicago Wedge, etc. are included in these compilations. I collected some suggestions from y'all here on r/phish, and on various facebook groups. 

The two compilations are zip files that you can unzip and add to iTunes or your favorite media organizing software. You can put them on your phones, mp3 players, etc, and listen anywhere. Each compilation is over 20 hours long, and about 2gb; download speed is pretty good, unless there's a lot of traffic it might slow down a little. You are welcome to share the link with anyone you'd like, we're hosting it ourselves and it won't get taken down.

I remember the moment I realize it was silly to have them. A friend's gf was over and saw the discs and joked ""people still use these?""

"Can you guys recommend any shows/jams to get me, a huge Deadhead, into Phish?","Hey all,

I hope the title doesn't come across the wrong way, i.e. as douchey or condescending.

I'm sure you get these posts a lot, but I'm a big Deadhead. In fact, I'm sure there are many of you here. I've listened to hundreds of shows, they're practically all I listen to. But it didn't start that way. I didn't hear the Dead for the first time and just fall in love; it took a couple of tries until I found something that stuck, and it opened me up to the rest of their catalogue where I was able to appreciate what I didn't see before. Same thing happened with Dylan.

Thus, my philosophy has generally been (as John Mayer put it): you just haven't gotten into the Dead *yet*. Of course, this isn't true for everyone, but I've seen it happen a lot with the Dead, and jam bands as a whole.

So I have a feeling it's that same way in regards to my relationship with Phish. I've heard some of their stuff, both live and studio, and have generally liked what I've heard. But I haven't really gotten *into* them. I'm very open to all music, and I want to immerse myself for the day.

So, could you do me a favor, and hit me with some killer jams/shows that you think would translate well to a Deadhead? Something I love about the Dead is that they're kind of messy & sloppy, but they roll with it. They jam and just play what's in the air, mistakes and all, and it just seems to *work*. One of the 'turnoffs' (and very unfairly so) of Phish to me, so far, has been that they're too ""tight."" So, in addition to the best/your favorite jams, could you recommend anything that's a bit more mellow, maybe even a little sloppy?

I love the energy of Phish, and I'm really excited to start this musical journey.

Thanks so much in advance :-)

MSG vets - a question about colocated seating,"I'm tasked with landing 2 additional tickets in section 105 for the 7/30 show. I find myself wondering which sections might be""close enough"".

In other arena shows,  I've found it easy to find open seats in other sections so folks cam stand together regardless of their ticketed section. Does MSG monitor where people go within certain sections. For example,  I'm sure you can't easily get into the floor without floor seats. Could someone in section 110 easily migrate to section 105 if there were open seats for them to stand? 

Disclaimer: I'm not suggesting or advocating crowding inbetween seats where there's no room and paying fans are getting cramped. I'm just trying to figure out which sections outside of 105 would allow access to the same if there is space. ",phish,1495461845,mpagano1,5,1,True,2017-05-22

Help me find a Phish shirt for a friend? Where can I find this?,"Hello,

I'm friends with a huge head. He's the type who has two tickets for the entire Baker's Dozen and thinks nothing of it, like it's something that normal people do... I've seen them maybe half a dozen times, and enjoy myself.

His birthday is coming up and I want to do something special. I remember him saying he LOVES this image and want's a shirt of it:

I had to search pretty hard to find the photo (lots off google searches). Does anyone know (or have seen) shirts with this image? Like an all black shirt with this image in white? Does this photo/scene have like a ""name"" or reference that would make my search easier?

Looking for some good Type 1 jams!,"Need a little bit of help. Have a friend who is going to his first show in Denver this year, need something as an 'Intro to Phish' if you will.

He likes Type 1 jams, so I want to ease him in that way (yes I know this is blasphemy in a way, but we'll get to Type 2 later... baby steps). Any Type 1 with a good peak would be perfect. Stash, wolfman's, ghost, sand, julius, kill devil, weekapaug, hood, reba, divided sky, bathtub, etc..., whatever song works.

I'd like to stick with 3.0 since that's a little more representative of what he'll hear at the show. (We'll get him into '97 funk or Machine Gun Trey '94 some other time).

Tl;dr - need some Type 1 jams from 3.0 with killer peaks (or just a good version)! Any help is appreciated!


Edit: Loosening up the criteria some because of some u/drunken-giraffe song suggestions. Some light Type 2 is ok. For example if Ghost goes into a bliss jam awesome. If Tweezer undergoes some small changes but remains a tight jam, perfect. Stuff like that. Just trying to not start him off with 9/1/12 Light.",phish,1496716770,GoodAboutHood,30,5,True,2017-06-05

My first Phish show was at Wrigley Stadium,"I'm sure the Cubs fans don't get to toke bowls as openly as we did! I was shocked at how lax security really was. Given, we all went through a metal detector on our way in, but I think they were glad to have us as compared to angry and drunk baseball fans. I didn't witness a single act of aggression or any sort of fight break out in my time there.

I found out my friend had open seats in a carpool there just hours before departure. One of the guys riding with us claimed he could get us a free room at the Hard Rock Hotel in downtown Chicago, but ended up buying it for us. Let me mention, this guy also covered all of the funds for gas and also had us driving his car. He was DRUNK the entire time. He never made it into one of the shows even though he got all the way to the venue with a ticket adjacent to the rest of us. It was a 2night show and Saturday night we got back to the hotel to find puke and piss everywhere, with all of our things gone. He got kicked out and took everything of ours with him to this hotel by the airport because he planned on flying his girlfriend out to save him. This man had no phone and was untraceable because he left his lap top in a cab he wouldn't even get on the hotel lobby computer to respond to our Facebook messages. He also crapped in one of my friends shorts he was borrowing, because he peed in his own. Well we got a hold of his girlfriend and she told us which hotel and room number we could reach him at. We couldn't get his car out of the valet because we didn't know the plate #or have the confirmation ticket. Ended up having to take the subway to the air port and grab a shuttle bus to the hotel on the outskirts of town. He was not one but apologetic, and on our way home we finally cut him off from the alcohol and so e got a bottle of cough syrup from the gas station. Thank god he sat in the back or I would have had to smack him to shut up several times as he insisted he needed shot gun because it was his car and began guilt tripping everyone on the fact that he had paid our way here. (((I can barely make eye contact with this man now when I see him out at shows)))

Backtrack::: we got tickets from the ""lot"" which was essentially a multi block radius around the stadium of bars and businesses that are no strangers to large events. Our first seats were on left field and I helped my friend tie a bracelet to get on the floor onto his wrist with a strap I cut off from my shirt.PSfree the fucking nipples! I was the only girl amongst the row of shirtless men) 
He never surfaced to let me have my go at the ground level. The stage was in the far back center field and everyone on the floor was infield or outfield. We got back to the room that night to find drunk guy sippin on bloody Mary's in the room.

The next day our tickets were section 421 and we all rolled our eyes thinking they'd be shitty considering we wanted to be closer to the ground. Turns out the section was directly centered in line with the stage and with a bird's eye view so we caught the best breeze (this was in June) and literally had birds flying eye level with us. My carpool only had four tickets to the section but we packed it full with about a dozen of our friends. 

I wasn't drinking the overpriced beer so I kept going on literal runs to the bottom level to fill up from the water fountain. Someone in line was so shocked I hadn't made it to the ground floor, she was super sweet and grabbed my hand to lead me there, saying I just had to act like I belonged and no one would question me. WADING IN THE VELVET SEA is playing, people are throwing glow sticks to me and lassoing me in so I start swimming with my arms as I approach security. She was hugging three balloons and gently elbowed me back as I tried to pass her. Damn.",phish,1492018836,AbNorMaLacTiviTies,17,0,True,2017-04-12

* Side bar that has a radio feed for Re-Listen. All specific songs mentioned in threads could be added to the radio.

* An option to link a song mentioned in a thread to a Re-Listen URL.

* Some sort of BOT that sees a date, interprets and posts setlist and a link to all songs mentioned in the comments section that lives in the setlist. For example. Someone mentioned 97 Winston Salem, someone posts the date and the setlistbot command, below it in the comment, someone mentions bathtub Gin rules, BOT then can post link to that specific song in that setlist.

"Newbies coming over from r/srotd, this band has changed my life and I hope you'll give them a go.","Never did I think I would travel so much just to see music. Never did I think I'd be brought to tears during songs. Never did I think I'd make some of my closest friends ever just because of a certain beer they were selling in the lot. This band creates a sense of unmatched community. The further I dive in, the more references I find around the world. As a listener, I am rewarded by my pursuit and diligence. No show, no set, no song is the same as it once has been and that is the reason (I imagine it goes the same for others here) that I continue to crawl back.

This band has helped me with my every day anxiety. Sometimes, you have to surrender to the flow and feel weightless - knowing the ground is beneath you and you will soon return. No longer do I give a shit if I look silly bee-bopping around a sidewalk or through an airport. These guys have released me into such an abundance of joy that it overwhelms me everyday. They make me laugh, they bring smiles to my face and others, and some of their lyrics have shaped my life in unthinkable ways.

I'm on mobile so I can't really do links but follow those that have been posted. Figure out what kinda Phish you dig - they'll blow your mind with their variety of sound.

How about an anecdote from your first show?,"I'll start: First show was the Great Went.  I heard Phish for the first time on the drive from NJ to Maine.  ""Contact"" stuck out and had me wondering what I had gotten in to.  After appropriately medicating, had an amazing first night.  A midget/little person dressed like a leprechaun joined our post-show camp circle and proceeded to play an absolutely surreal rendition of ""the devil went down to Georgia"" on the fiddle as I peaked.  The next day friends verified that this actually happened.  

Also I remember Tweezer totally rocked (though I was laughing a bit at the lyrics as Phish virgins tend to do) and the people I was with were really excited about The Story of the Ghost which was new at the time.

Interesting catch in the Tahoe Tweezer,"I just caught this little bit for the first time while listening to the renowned Tahoe Tweezer for the umpteenth time (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eBibggCibE). One of the things that phans love to talk about most is how the band is always playing off each other and always seem to know exactly when to build into peaks or segue into different jam sections. For me, I've really always wondered how they know exactly what notes to play in order to always sound in sync during Type II. I hope you guys find this as interesting as I did when I heard it, but if you listen just to Paige at 26:10-26:16, you can hear him happen across the main chords that will build into the peak. Instantly he knows he has something good, and a few seconds later Mike picks up on it and follows. Surprisingly Trey is the last to the party, but also hears it and recognizes it as something hot a few seconds after Mike, and the boys are off on one of the most famous jam builds and peaks in history. I re-listened to this 15 second stretch about 10 times to make sure I had it right. Obviously, this Tweezer is legendary for the Type II, and I think this is about as clear cut as it gets for an example of the boys instantly happening on a musical phrase and turning it into something magical.",phish,1492745611,boolaboola20,19,12,True,2017-04-20
I gave Trey a letter last night at TAB in Charlotte and he read it!,"So a few weeks ago, knowing that I was going to see TAB in Charlotte, I decided to write the man a letter. It was about 2 and a half pages long, basically just expressed what his music and Phish meant to me, everything it has done for me, the experiences I've had because of it, and how it's helped me through some very rough times. Also said ""THANK YOU"" 4 or 5 times lol. 


Rode the rail to give it to him, was almost dead center, and after an extra long set 1 I held it up and he took it backstage with him during intermission! He came back out for set 2 and after the second song I was looking at him and cheering. He turned and pointed at me, I was like me? And he said, ""Yeah you, this is for you."" He proceeded to play the song Alive Again which corresponded to a big, emotional part of the letter I wrote him. I've never been happier. After the epic 4 song encore, he shook my hand before going backstage. 


This was one of the best experiences of my entire life, and I'm terribly happy right now, just wanted to share this with people I thought would appreciate it. I've always thought Trey is such a genuine and caring guy and this confirmed it. 


TL,DR:Wrote and gave a letter to Trey, he read it and played a song for me about part of it, shook my hand afterward, he's a great dude.

Old tapes looking for a new home,"I'm doing some spring cleaning and have decided it's time to get rid of my old tapes. 

I have at least 50 Phish tapes (i.e. 25 shows) that I accumulated back in the rec.music.phish days. More than half are 1997 or 98 shows, the rest are earlier. I'm not sure if anyone is interested in tapes anymore, but if you are let me know. I'll give you the tapes for free, but you need to pay me for shipping. These brought me a lot of joy back in the day, so I'd really like to give them to someone who'll play them again.

Tela is the most beautiful Phish song in existence today.,"I have come to this conclusion by listening to it.

The lyrics give me chills. Trey soothes us with mellow, jazzy chords and then melts just enough face at the end. Page compliments Trey with the chords and has those gorgeous, lengthy runs up and down the piano. Fish provides that bossa nova-esque beat that leads the slow, steady pacing of the song. Mike provides a nice base (heh) for all of it to ride on.

Curious about Mike-led Jamming?,"the question is often asked 'who is leading the jam?' and in general the easy answer is Trey and to a lesser extent Page since their instruments lend themselves more directly towards that end. But there are numerous examples of both Fish and Mike taking charge and directing the proceedings. In the late 90s Mike did this with more regularity, resulting in some of the big, groove-based jam templates that sprung out of vehicles like Ghost, Piper, Halley's, and more. Here is but one example of the form, the Great Woods Piper from 09.11.2000. 

http://phish.in/2000-09-11/piper

I recommend this entire set from the extended raging Type I of Chalkdust to the about-to-burst-at-the-seams pregnant energy of Twist to the soupy groove of Piper to the unique bit of Mike improv in WTU? and finally through the capstone YEM that acts as punctuation on the proceedings.

Why I like Phish.,"First off , I am a newbie.  I was not fortunate enough to be introduced to this band early on I'm my life.  I always had the mindset that, ""Ok here's another one of those bands that play weird songs with some awesome jam moments"". I technically wasn't wrong but I have come to absolutely adore this band.  I went to My first Phish show , and something inside me clicked.  I finally got ""it"". For a band that has been around for some time now, they just know how to keep you guessing at every moment.  Too me when I listen to an album now it feels more like a journey.  It might sound cheesy and I'm sorry.  It's music that I feel speaks to everyone in some way if they would only give it a chance.  After my first show I stuck around wrapping my head around the journey they took me on.  It was amazing.. plain and simple.  I'm hooked and I can not wait to go to another show.

I definitely don't know them all, so could you comment below with any that you can think off the top of your head, or your favorites, that should be included? List the name of the jam and the date (so I can find them).

If it's not ""officially"" named by the community, feel free to list it and then point out some good reasons why it's a standout version, and if it gets a significant amount of upvotes from others, it might get included.

Wading in the Velvet Sea used to be a very different song.,"We all know the song as it appears on Ghost and is performed live, but I'm not sure many people realize how much it has changed. 

[The Demo Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWzsNOG7As8) that Trey and Tom recorded when they were developing much of Ghost and Farmhouse is very different from the final product. 

For one, we hear a different opening progression that seems to rise rather than fall. Second, the chorus ""I've been wading in the velvet sea"" is repeated throughout the song and over the verses. 

Most notably, though, is the lack of a bridge. The Bm > C progression that occurs after the verse and before the solo (which ultimately brings in an Am that is probably one of my favorite chord changes) is not present. The song repeats the Chorus and maintains the G > D > Em > C > D  pattern.

When it was played live in 1997 in both Europe and the US, the live versions were still based very heavily on this demo. You can hear the sound in this rather haunting rendition from [7/2/97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYupVLM3kLI#t=42m55s). 

When Phish started bringing it into rotation in 1997, it kept much of the demo's signature features in addition to the overall structure, such as the siren and repeated chorus throughout. It does, however, incorporate soloing from Trey at the end as well as a revised and more iconic piano intro from Page. 

When the song returned for the 1998 tour it was as we know it now and as it appears on the album. 

If any of you have some insight as to how or when or why it changed, I'd love to hear about it!

Life became a pursuit of more shows..  More songs.. More bustouts..  Traveling to different cities while my parents & college professors scoffed at my lack of focus at school.  
Looking back at when the bands wheels got loose, and then hiatus, has left a void in my mind and I don't relate much to 2000-2009.   The 3.0 era has kept me attuned, wanting to keep going to shows, and I find I'm  always curious what's next.

Phish 1.0 vs Phish 2.0 vs Phish 3.0,"I'm kind of nut when it comes to music.  I will jam out Sinatra for a week straight, then some Miles Davis for another week, etc, wtc but at the end of the day I always manage to sneak in some Phish as a pallet cleanser.  So I was going through my library and I pulled out some Cow Funk era Phish.  12/31/97 TBE.  What a sick, sick show.  I don't usually go back because I have either heard it a ton or I was at that show.  So as I was listening I kept saying to myself, That Trey solo was missing this or Page would drop this tickle of the ivories over here and so on and so on.  Again, sick, sick show.  Certainly my top 10 pick.

Anyway....I couldn't help think to myself, how I don't miss past Phish because as a band, they are better musicians now than then.  Which is weird, because for a few years there I really wasn't on board with Phish 2.0/3.0.  I craved the days of 35 min YEMs or on stage antics (I cried when they gave the trampolines to the crowd at Coventry).  The four as a band have evolved and grown in such a way that imho they are better talents now vs then.  Sure I miss the past.  Tons of great memories on tour back in my teens and early twenties.  But the jams and the songs they are writing now are such a positive step to a better experience, I don't I just seem to dig it now and yurn for more.

Fishman's heartfelt tribute to Col. Bruce Hampton,"BRUCE HAMPTON 

He made everybody comfortable in their own skin, and as a result it always brought out the best in all of them. That's why he was always surrounded by so much excellence. Not just in music, but in humanity. In intent. 

Bruce's intent was love. Period. I never heard him put that word to it, but he was all about intent. His mantra was ""Intent, Release and Recovery"", but everything always started with intent.

Over the 27 years I've known him, in basically every encounter I had with him or interaction I witnessed him in, the love in his intent was consistently among the purest and most powerful I have ever known. It was like a sun. Seriously. It had gravity. It created orbits. And for those of us who experienced it one way or the other, if perhaps even only from afar, it had more of an impact than we could have ever realized at the time. But whether we knew it or not, since the first time we encountered it, it altered us, changed us, touched us, affected us...and from that point forward it permeated our beings and has come through the music we play, the gigs we book, the articles we write, the concerts we promote, the audience members we are, the food we cook....the grace with which we handle the challenges of life. 

He didn't take most things too seriously (and that obviously rubbed off quite a bit on more than a few of us!), but for what he did, the degree of intention to his intent also meant that he was really not fuckin' around. And at the pinnacle of his musical life, in front of a sold out crowd at arguably the most beautiful theater in the country, with a stage full of the most talented collective I've ever been a part of, ranging in age from our early teens to our mid 70's, supported by equally talented promoters, managers, caterers etc,....ALL of whom were there because they LOVED the man for how good he made each and every one of them feel about whatever they brought to the table....he sang out one last time ""let it shine, let it shine, let it shine"" with all the love in his heart, and he meant every word just as he always did, but this time the intent overwhelmed the vessel. 

As we were walking away from the venue in the shock and confusion of the moments after his collapse, a fellow musician posed the question,‚ÄùDid he really just take it THERE?"" Yep. Yes he did. He just took it there.

That was the Release. A lifetime's worth of everything that a life as full as Bruce's could contain. 

Besides the consistency with which Bruce valued Intent and adhered to the Now he had an equally deep appreciation for good showmanship, and an extraordinary eye for talent. He being Exhibit A of the former, and absolutely all the members of the various bands he lead being examples of the latter. He also had a tremendous sense of humor which allowed him to embrace the ludicrousness of virtually everything with good nature and a deep laugh. I once asked him how the hell he put together band after band of the baddest mother*#%~!'s I'd ever seen on whatever instruments and his response was, ""Fish, every band only needs one wrecking ball. They put it up and I tear it down!!""

Being that as it is, I find it virtually impossible to view the manner in which he departed as anything other than the ultimate theatrical accomplishment / practical joke / paradoxical, expressionistic heeeyyeeaarrrr whaaaaahhho ah! haa ha ha hhhaaaaaa....intended to elicit the entire range of human emotion and response in one fell swoop; to seamlessly transition from shine-ee to shine-er in one love intent filled moment leaving us all laughing, crying and astonished at the same time. 

I just can't help feeling that being in the moment, as always, he saw the opportunity to make it as real as it gets, comparable to nothing, and took it. And I believe he took it for our benefit, certainly not at our expense, because that could never be his intent. But still, to intend it is one thing... to actually pull it off?!?! 

Viewed from this angle It's certainly the greatest act of showmanship I expect to ever witness in my lifetime short of spontaneous combustion...which I hope to accomplish someday in his honor! 

And therein, for me, lies the trick, the humor, the mystery, the essence of who Bruce was. This time, with all the love he could muster and what surely could have only been the best intent, he went ""out"" once again, but this time he didn't come back. This time he left the Recovery to us, but not before turning the light he sang for around and giving us all a quick glimpse of the richness of our own humanity in its glow, and a lasting mental picture of what a roomful of good intent looks like. 

I realize that not everyone will view the moment of his departure through the same celebratory and even humorous lens as I, but it is my intent that my words ring true in regards to who Bruce was/is, and that the love and appreciation I have tried to express for him and what he has brought to my life speaks to some degree to anyone else who knew him in whatever capacity, be it for a minute or a lifetime, and that it brings some measure of assistance to the healing process. 

But if my words still leave any doubt as to whether the manner in which Bruce left was right in line with who he really was, and something to celebrate rather than lament, Bruce's own words from a 1970 interview on the question, ‚ÄúWhat is Grease?"" say it better than any of us ever could anyway: ""See, our main ambition in life aside from growing a bosom on top of our heads is to die on stage and when we die on stage that will be when we ultimately reach Grease."" 

Bruce, I hope that in whatever greasy reaches of the Omniverse your travels take you, your love light shines as brightly as it did here on earth. We will all miss you and we all thank you, sir, for your service.

RIP Timber! (my friend's dog),"Timber, named after the Phish song of course, was such a sweet dog. He was a bull mastiff mix, and a massive dude. Whenever he saw you, it's almost like he was smiling. Whenever I think of my buddy, I always think of Timber. They were best buddies.

I'm not a massive Phish fan, but I've seen them around 6/7 times, and many times with my friend. He's seen them well over a hundred times, if not more. Has been to NYE a bunch of times. Traveled all over the country to see them, and when he got his first dog, he of course named him after his favorite song, Timber.

I had the luxury of watching Timber several times when my buddy went to go see Phish, or traveled elsewhere. 

My buddy was told, I think due to the sheer size of him, that his life expectancy was 7-8 years. Timber lived to be 12 years and 7 months.

Recently, my buddy told me that Timber's legs had given out a while ago, and he was not able to control his bladder anymore. He had an issues with his body breaking down internally, and he was fading fast. Him and his fiance made the decision to put him down today.

My buddy, being the stand-up guy that he is, reached out to me, and others, specifically to tell us the news. He wanted those that were a part of his life to know what was going on.

I wanted to send out a small homage to Timber because he was a sweet dog, and I'm happy to have been a part of his life. RIP Timber :(.

Phish is Anime?,"Am I the only one nerdy enough to hear Phish peaks as epic anime battles?  

I've tried to explain this to friends, so [I just made a little mashup as an example](https://youtu.be/887XwE-PXjs).  (10/31/94 Antelope with a scene from One Piece).  

I'm sure the venn diagram of phish/anime fans is relatively slim... But I see the tension/release of phish as very similar to japanese animation action scenes in terms of movement and timing, especially the ""anticipation"" and ""main action"" in animation terms.

Looking to finance a large Chalk Dust Torture Reprise sign for all 13 days of The Residency,"I will repost this closer to the date, but as I am on the West Coast and not going to either The Residency or Dick's this year :( then the next best thing to do is help someone who is going for all 13 nights construct a Chalk Dust Torture Reprise sign.

Will provide funds as to what is needed, but the person will have to take the sign and hold it up in between songs. 

Obviously there are some things to work out, but that is why I am posting now, with over 2 months in advance.

Any general ideas are accepted with relation to this idea.

We will get our CTD Reprise! It's been 17 years!

EDIT: When it happens you all will be happy. So let me have my fun.",phish,1494381435,MarkRosewater,28,2,True,2017-05-09

Where to start for a total noob?,"I've never really listened to phish before. Heard a few songs here and there that I've enjoyed. I'm a huge my morning jacket, and Umphrey's McGee fan. I'd say they're easily my two favorites right now. Seen the two of them the most out of any other band. Recently been getting into Spafford who a lot of people tell me play a little bit like phish. Where should I start? Where's the best place to listen to live phish shows? Is the studio stuff worth it?",phish,1494454289,UnfreezeMcGee,19,1,True,2017-05-10
